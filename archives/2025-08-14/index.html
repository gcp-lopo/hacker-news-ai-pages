<h2 id="new-ps1bot-malware-campaign-uses-malvertising-to-deploy-multi-stage-in-memory-attacks"><a id="article-1"></a>New PS1Bot Malware Campaign Uses Malvertising to Deploy Multi-Stage In-Memory Attacks</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new malvertising campaign that‚Äôs designed to infect victims with a multi-stage malware framework called
PS1Bot
. ‚ÄúPS1Bot features a modular design, with several modules delivered used to perform a variety of malicious activities on infected systems, including information theft, keylogging, reconnaissance, and the establishment of persistent system access,‚Äù Cisco Talos researchers Edmund Brumaghin and Jordyn Dunk
said
. ‚ÄúPS1Bot has been designed with stealth in mind, minimizing persistent artifacts left on infected systems and incorporating in-memory execution techniques to facilitate execution of follow-on modules without requiring them to be written to disk.‚Äù
Campaigns distributing the PowerShell and C# malware have been found to be active since early 2025, leveraging malvertising as a propagation vector, with the infection chains executing modules in-memory to minimize forensic trail. PS1Bot is assessed to share technical overlaps with AHK Bot, an AutoHotkey-based malware previously put to use by threat actors
Asylum Ambuscade
and
TA866
.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the activity cluster has been identified as overlapping with previous ransomware-related campaigns utilizing a malware named
Skitnet
(aka Bossnet) with an aim to steal data and establish remote control over compromised hosts. The starting point of the attack is a compressed archive that‚Äôs delivered to victims via malvertising or search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning. Present within the ZIP file is a JavaScript payload that serves as a downloader to retrieve a scriptlet from an external server, which then writes a PowerShell script to a file on disk and executes it. The PowerShell script is responsible for contacting a command-and-control (C2) server and fetching next-stage PowerShell commands that allow the operators to augment the malware‚Äôs functionality in a modular fashion and carry out a wide range of actions on the compromised host -
Antivirus detection, which obtains and reports the list of antivirus programs present on the infected system
Screen capture, which captures screenshots on infected systems and transmits the resulting images to the C2 server
Wallet grabber, which steals data from web browsers (and wallet extensions), application data for cryptocurrency wallet applications, and files containing passwords, sensitive strings, or wallet seed phrases
Keylogger, which logs keystrokes and gathers clipboard content
Information collection, which harvests and transmits information about the infected system and environment to the attacker
Persistence, which creates a PowerShell script such that it‚Äôs automatically launched when the system restarts, incorporating the same logic used to establish the C2 polling process to fetch the modules
‚ÄúThe information stealer module implementation leverages wordlists embedded into the stealer to enumerate files containing passwords and seed phrases that can be used to access cryptocurrency wallets, which the stealer also attempts to exfiltrate from infected systems,‚Äù Talos noted.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe modular nature of the implementation of this malware provides flexibility and enables the rapid deployment of updates or new functionality as needed.‚Äù
The disclosure comes as Google said it‚Äôs leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) systems powered by large language models (LLMs) to fight invalid traffic (
IVT
) and more precisely identify ad placements generating invalid behaviors. ‚ÄúOur new applications provide faster and stronger protections by analyzing app and web content, ad placements and user interactions,‚Äù Google
said
. ‚ÄúFor example, they‚Äôve significantly improved our content review capabilities, leading to a 40% reduction in IVT stemming from deceptive or disruptive ad serving practices.‚Äù

<h2 id="ai-soc-101-key-capabilities-security-leaders-need-to-know"><a id="article-4"></a>AI SOC 101: Key Capabilities Security Leaders Need to Know</h2>

<p>Security operations have never been a 9-to-5 job. For SOC analysts, the day often starts and ends deep in a queue of alerts, chasing down what turns out to be false positives, or switching between half a dozen tools to piece together context. The work is repetitive, time-consuming, and high-stakes, leaving SOCs under constant pressure to keep up, yet often struggling to stay ahead of emerging threats. That combination of inefficiency, elevated risk, and a reactive operating model is exactly where AI-powered SOC capabilities are starting to make a difference.</p>

<p>Why AI SOC is gaining traction now
The recent Gartner Hype Cycle for Security Operations 2025 (download
a complimentary copy
) recognizes
AI SOC Agents
as an innovation trigger, reflecting a broader shift in how teams approach automation. Instead of relying solely on static playbooks or manual investigation workflows, AI SOC capabilities bring reasoning, adaptability, and context-aware decision-making into the mix. SOC teams report that their most pressing challenges are inefficient investigations, siloed tools, and a lack of effective automation. These issues slow response and increase risk.</p>

<p>The latest
SANS SOC Survey
underscores this, showing these operational hurdles consistently outpace other concerns. AI-driven triage, investigation, and detection coverage analysis are well-positioned to address these gaps head-on. AI‚Äôs biggest wins in the SOC
An AI SOC brings together a
range of capabilities
that strengthen and scale the core functions of a security operations center. These capabilities work alongside human expertise to improve how teams triage alerts, investigate threats, respond to incidents, and refine detections over time.</p>

<p>Triage at speed and scale
AI systems can review and prioritize every incoming alert within minutes, pulling telemetry from across the environment. True threats rise to the top quickly, while false positives are resolved without draining analyst time. Faster, deeper investigations and response
By correlating data from SIEM, EDR, identity, email, and cloud platforms, AI SOC tools reduce mean time to investigate (MTTI) and mean time to respond (MTTR). This shortens dwell time and limits the opportunity for threats to spread.</p>

<p>Detection engineering insights
AI can pinpoint coverage gaps against frameworks such as MITRE ATT&amp;CK, identify rules that need tuning, and recommend adjustments based on real investigation data. This gives detection engineers a clear view of where changes will make the most impact. Enabling more threat hunting
With less time spent working alert queues, analysts can shift to proactive threat hunting. AI SOC platforms with natural language query support make it easier to explore data, run complex hunts, and surface hidden threats.</p>

<p>Separating hype from reality
The AI SOC market is filled with sweeping claims about fully
autonomous SOC
and instant results. While AI can automate large portions of tier 1 and tier 2 investigations and even support tier 3 work, it is not a replacement for experienced analysts. Complex, high impact cases still require human judgment, contextual understanding, and decision making. The real value lies in shifting the balance of work.</p>

<p>By removing repetitive triage and speeding investigations, AI frees analysts to focus on higher impact activities like advanced threat hunting, tuning detections, and investigating sophisticated threats. This is the work that improves both security outcomes and analyst retention. Guiding principles for evaluating AI SOC capabilities
When assessing AI SOC solutions, focus on principles that determine whether they can deliver sustainable improvements to security operations:
Transparency and explainability
‚Äì The system should provide clear, detailed reasoning for its findings, allowing analysts to trace conclusions back to the underlying data and logic. This builds trust and enables informed decision making.</p>

<p>Data privacy and security
‚Äì Understand exactly where data is processed and stored, how it is protected in transit and at rest, and whether the deployment model meets your compliance requirements. Integration depth
‚Äì The solution should integrate seamlessly with your existing SOC stack and workflows. This includes preserving the familiar user experience of tools like SIEM, EDR, and case management systems to avoid introducing friction. Adaptability and learning
‚Äì AI should improve over time by incorporating analyst feedback, adapting to changes in your environment, and staying effective against evolving threats.</p>

<p>Accuracy and trust
‚Äì Evaluate not just the volume of work automated, but the precision and reliability of results. A tool that closes false positives at scale but misses real threats creates more risk than it solves. Time to value
‚Äì Favor solutions that deliver measurable gains in investigation speed, accuracy, or coverage within weeks rather than months, without heavy customization or lengthy deployments. The human and AI hybrid SOC
The most effective SOCs combine the speed and scale of AI with the contextual understanding and judgment of human analysts.</p>

<p>This model gives people the capacity to focus on the work that matters most. How Prophet Security aligns with this vision

<h2 id="microsoft-august-2025-patch-tuesday-fixes-kerberos-zero-day-among-111-total-new-flaws"><a id="article-6"></a>Microsoft August 2025 Patch Tuesday Fixes Kerberos Zero-Day Among 111 Total New Flaws</h2>

<p>Microsoft on Tuesday rolled out fixes for a
massive set of 111 security flaws
across its software portfolio, including one flaw that has been disclosed as publicly known at the time of the release. Of the 111 vulnerabilities, 16 are rated Critical, 92 are rated Important, two are rated Moderate, and one is rated Low in severity. Forty-four of the vulnerabilities relate to privilege escalation, followed by remote code execution (35), information disclosure (18), spoofing (8), and denial-of-service (4) defects. This is in addition to
16 vulnerabilities
addressed in Microsoft‚Äôs Chromium-based Edge browser since the release of
last month‚Äôs Patch Tuesday update
, including two spoofing bugs affecting Edge for Android.</p>

<p>Included among the vulnerabilities is a privilege escalation vulnerability impacting Microsoft Exchange Server hybrid deployments (
CVE-2025-53786
, CVSS score: 8.0) that Microsoft disclosed last week. The publicly disclosed zero-day is
CVE-2025-53779
(CVSS score: 7.2), another privilege escalation flaw in Windows Kerberos that stems from a case of relative path traversal. Akamai researcher Yuval Gordon has been credited with discovering and reporting the bug. It‚Äôs worth mentioning here that the issue was publicly detailed back in May 2025 by the web infrastructure and security company, giving it the codename
BadSuccessor
.</p>

<p>The novel technique essentially
allows
a threat actor with sufficient privileges to compromise an Active Directory (AD) domain by misusing delegated Managed Service Account (dMSA) objects. ‚ÄúThe good news here is that successful exploitation of CVE-2025-53779 requires an attacker to have pre-existing control of two attributes of the hopefully well protected dMSA:
msds-groupMSAMembership
, which determines which users may use credentials for the managed service account, and
msds-ManagedAccountPrecededByLink
, which contains a list of users on whose behalf the dMSA can act,‚Äù Adam Barnett, lead software engineer at Rapid7, told The Hacker News. ‚ÄúHowever, abuse of CVE-2025-53779 is certainly plausible as the final link of a multi-exploit chain which stretches from no access to total pwnage.‚Äù
Action1‚Äôs Mike Walters noted that the path traversal flaw can be abused by an attacker to create improper delegation relationships, enabling them to impersonate privileged accounts, escalate to a domain administrator, and potentially gain full control of the Active Directory domain. ‚ÄúAn attacker who already has a compromised privileged account can use it to move from limited administrative rights to full domain control,‚Äù Walters
added
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt can also be paired with methods such as Kerberoasting or Silver Ticket attacks to maintain persistence.‚Äù
‚ÄúWith domain administrator privileges, attackers can disable security monitoring, modify Group Policy, and tamper with audit logs to hide their activity. In multi-forest environments or organizations with partner connections, this flaw could even be leveraged to move from one compromised domain to others in a supply chain attack.‚Äù
Satnam Narang, senior staff research engineer at Tenable, said the immediate impact of BadSuccessor is limited, as only 0.7% of Active Directory domains had met the prerequisite at the time of disclosure. ‚ÄúTo exploit BadSuccessor, an attacker must have at least one domain controller in a domain running Windows Server 2025 in order to achieve domain compromise,‚Äù Narang pointed out. Some of notable Critical-rated vulnerabilities patched by Redmond this month are below -
CVE-2025-53767
(CVSS score: 10.0) - Azure OpenAI Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability
CVE-2025-53766
(CVSS score: 9.8) - GDI+ Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
CVE-2025-50165
(CVSS score: 9.8) - Windows Graphics Component Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
CVE-2025-53792
(CVSS score: 9.1) - Azure Portal Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability
CVE-2025-53787
(CVSS score: 8.2) - Microsoft 365 Copilot BizChat Information Disclosure Vulnerability
CVE-2025-50177
(CVSS score: 8.1) - Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
CVE-2025-50176
(CVSS score: 7.8) - DirectX Graphics Kernel Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
Microsoft noted that the three cloud service CVEs impacting Azure OpenAI, Azure Portal, and Microsoft 365 Copilot BizChat have already been remediated, and that they require no customer action.</p>

<p>Check Point, which disclosed
CVE-2025-53766
alongside
CVE-2025-30388
, said the vulnerabilities allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the affected system, leading to a full system compromise. ‚ÄúThe attack vector involves interacting with a specially crafted file. When a user opens or processes this file, the vulnerability is triggered, allowing the attacker to take control,‚Äù the cybersecurity company
said
. The Israeli firm revealed that it also uncovered a vulnerability in a Rust-based component of the Windows kernel that can result in a system crash that, in turn, triggers a hard reboot.</p>

<p>‚ÄúFor organizations with large or remote workforces, the risk is significant: attackers could exploit this flaw to simultaneously crash numerous computers across an enterprise, resulting in widespread disruption and costly downtime,‚Äù Check Point said. ‚ÄúThis discovery highlights that even with advanced security technologies like Rust, continuous vigilance and proactive patching are essential to maintaining system integrity in a complex software environment.‚Äù
Another vulnerability of importance is
CVE-2025-50154
(CVSS score: 6.5), an NTLM hash disclosure spoofing vulnerability that‚Äôs actually a bypass for a similar bug (
CVE-2025-24054
, CVSS score: 6.5) that was plugged by Microsoft in March 2025. ‚ÄúThe original vulnerability demonstrated how specially crafted requests could trigger NTLM authentication and expose sensitive credentials,‚Äù Cymulate researcher Ruben Enkaoua
said
. ‚ÄúThis new vulnerability [‚Ä¶] allows an attacker to extract NTLM hashes without any user interaction, even on fully patched systems.</p>

<p>By exploiting a subtle gap left in the mitigation, an attacker can trigger NTLM authentication requests automatically, enabling offline cracking or relay attacks to gain unauthorized access.‚Äù

<h2 id="charon-ransomware-hits-middle-east-sectors-using-apt-level-evasion-tactics"><a id="article-7"></a>Charon Ransomware Hits Middle East Sectors Using APT-Level Evasion Tactics</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new campaign that employs a previously undocumented ransomware family called Charon to target the Middle East‚Äôs public sector and aviation industry. The threat actor behind the activity, according to Trend Micro, exhibited tactics mirroring those of advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, such as DLL side-loading, process injection, and the ability to evade endpoint detection and response (EDR) software. The DLL side-loading techniques resemble those previously documented as part of attacks orchestrated by a China-linked hacking group called
Earth Baxia
, which was flagged by the cybersecurity company as targeting government entities in Taiwan and the Asia-Pacific region to deliver a backdoor known as EAGLEDOOR following the exploitation of a now-patched security flaw affecting OSGeo GeoServer GeoTools. ‚ÄúThe attack chain leveraged a legitimate browser-related file, Edge.exe (originally named cookie_exporter.exe), to sideload a malicious msedge.dll (SWORDLDR), which subsequently deployed the Charon ransomware payload,‚Äù researchers Jacob Santos, Ted Lee, Ahmed Kamal, and Don Ovid Ladore
said
.</p>

<p>Like other ransomware binaries, Charon is capable of disruptive actions that terminate security-related services and running processes, as well as delete shadow copies and backups, thereby minimizing the chances of recovery. It also employs
multithreading
and partial encryption techniques to make the file-locking routine faster and more efficient. Another notable aspect of the ransomware is the use of a driver compiled from the open-source
Dark-Kill project
to disable EDR solutions by means of what‚Äôs called a bring your own vulnerable driver (BYOVD) attack. However, this functionality is never triggered during the execution, suggesting that the feature is likely under development.</p>

<p>There is evidence to suggest that the campaign was targeted rather than opportunistic. This stems from the use of a customized ransom note that specifically calls out the victim organization by name, a tactic not observed in traditional ransomware attacks. It‚Äôs currently not known how the initial access was obtained. Despite the technical overlaps with Earth Baxia, Trend Micro has emphasized that this could mean one of three things -
Direct involvement of Earth Baxia
A false flag operation designed to deliberately imitate Earth Baxia‚Äôs tradecraft, or
A new threat actor that has independently developed similar tactics
‚ÄúWithout corroborating evidence such as shared infrastructure or consistent targeting patterns, we assess this attack demonstrates limited but notable technical convergence with known Earth Baxia operations,‚Äù Trend Micro pointed out.</p>

<p>Regardless of the attribution, the findings exemplify the ongoing trend of ransomware operators increasingly adopting sophisticated methods for malware deployment and defense evasion, further blurring the lines between cybercrime and nation-state activity. ‚ÄúThis convergence of APT tactics with ransomware operations poses an elevated risk to organizations, combining sophisticated evasion techniques with the immediate business impact of ransomware encryption,‚Äù the researchers concluded. The disclosure comes as eSentire detailed an
Interlock ransomware
campaign that leveraged ClickFix lures to drop a PHP-based backdoor that, in turn, deploys NodeSnake (aka Interlock RAT) for credential theft and a C-based implant that supports attacker-supplied commands for further reconnaissance and ransomware deployment. ‚ÄúInterlock Group employs a complex multi-stage process involving PowerShell scripts, PHP/NodeJS/C backdoors, highlighting the importance of monitoring suspicious process activity, LOLBins, and other TTPs,‚Äù the Canadian company
said
.</p>

<p>The findings show that ransomware continues to be an
evolving threat
, even as victims continue to pay ransoms to quickly recover access to systems. Cybercriminals, on the other hand, have begun resorting to physical threats and DDoS attacks as a way of putting pressure on victims. Statistics shared by Barracuda
show
that 57% of organizations experienced a successful ransomware attack in the last 12 months, of which 71% that had experienced an email breach were also hit with ransomware. What‚Äôs more, 32% paid a ransom, but only 41% of the victims got all their data back.</p>

<h2 id="researchers-spot-xz-utils-backdoor-in-dozens-of-docker-hub-images-fueling-supply-chain-risks"><a id="article-8"></a>Researchers Spot XZ Utils Backdoor in Dozens of Docker Hub Images, Fueling Supply Chain Risks</h2>

<p>New research has uncovered Docker images on Docker Hub that contain the infamous XZ Utils backdoor, more than a year after the discovery of the incident. More troubling is the fact that other images have been built on top of these infected base images, effectively propagating the infection further in a transitive manner, Binarly REsearch
said
in a report shared with The Hacker News. The firmware security company said it discovered a total of 35 images that ship with the backdoor. The incident once again highlights the risks faced by the software supply chain.</p>

<p>Binarly‚Äôs Alex Matrosov told the publication that the investigation was prompted after it detected malicious code in one of their customer‚Äôs environments, ultimately finding that the images had been pulled from Docker Hub. The XZ Utils supply chain event (CVE-2024-3094, CVSS score: 10.0)
came to light
in late March 2024, when Andres Freund sounded the alarm on a backdoor embedded within XZ Utils versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1. Further
analysis
of the malicious code and the broader compromise led to
several startling discoveries
, the first and foremost being that the backdoor could lead to unauthorized remote access and enable the execution of arbitrary payloads through SSH. Specifically, the backdoor ‚Äì placed in the liblzma.so library and used by the OpenSSH server ‚Äì was designed such that it triggered when a client interacts with the infected SSH server.</p>

<p>By hijacking the RSA_public_decrypt function using the glibc‚Äôs IFUNC mechanism, the malicious code allowed an attacker possessing a specific private key to bypass authentication and execute root commands remotely,‚Äù Binarly explained. The second finding was that the changes were pushed by a developer named ‚ÄúJia Tan‚Äù (JiaT75), who spent almost two years contributing to the open-source project to build trust until they were given maintainer responsibilities, signaling the meticulous nature of the attack. ‚ÄúThis is clearly a very complex state-sponsored operation with impressive sophistication and multi-year planning,‚Äù Binarly noted at the time. ‚ÄúSuch a complex and professionally designed comprehensive implantation framework is not developed for a one-shot operation.‚Äù
The latest research from the company shows that the impact of the incident continues to send aftershocks through the open-source ecosystem even after all these months.</p>

<p>This includes the discovery of 12 Debian Docker images that contain
one of the XZ Utils backdoor
, and another set of second-order images that include the compromised Debian images. Binarly said it
reported
the base images to the Debian maintainers, who said they have ‚Äúmade an intentional choice to leave these artifacts available as a historical curiosity, especially given the following extremely unlikely (in containers/container image use cases) factors required for exploitation.‚Äù
However, the company pointed out that leaving publicly available Docker images that contain a potential network-reachable backdoor carries a significant security risk, despite the criteria required for successful exploitation ‚Äì the need for network access to the infected device with the SSH service running. ‚ÄúThe xz-utils backdoor incident demonstrates that even short-lived malicious code can remain unnoticed in official container images for a long time, and that can propagate in the Docker ecosystem,‚Äù it added. ‚ÄúThe delay underscores how these artifacts may silently persist and propagate through CI pipelines and container ecosystems, reinforcing the critical need for continuous binary-level monitoring beyond simple version tracking.‚Äù

<h2 id="fortinet-ssl-vpns-hit-by-global-brute-force-wave-before-attackers-shift-to-fortimanager"><a id="article-9"></a>Fortinet SSL VPNs Hit by Global Brute-Force Wave Before Attackers Shift to FortiManager</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers are warning of a ‚Äúsignificant spike‚Äù in brute-force traffic aimed at Fortinet SSL VPN devices. The coordinated activity, per threat intelligence firm GreyNoise, was
observed
on August 3, 2025, with over 780 unique IP addresses participating in the effort. As many as 56 unique IP addresses have been detected over the past 24 hours. All the IP addresses have been
classified
as malicious, with the IPs originating from the United States, Canada, Russia, and the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Targets of the brute-force activity include the United States, Hong Kong, Brazil, Spain, and Japan. ‚ÄúCritically, the observed traffic was also targeting our FortiOS profile, suggesting deliberate and precise targeting of Fortinet‚Äôs SSL VPNs,‚Äù GreyNoise
said
. ‚ÄúThis was not opportunistic ‚Äì it was focused activity.‚Äù
The company also pointed out that it identified two distinct assault waves spotted before and after August 5: One, a long-running, brute-force activity tied to a single TCP signature that remained relatively steady over time, and Two, which involved a sudden and concentrated burst of traffic with a different TCP signature. ‚ÄúWhile the August 3 traffic has targeted the FortiOS profile, traffic fingerprinted with TCP and client signatures ‚Äì a meta signature ‚Äì from August 5 onward was not hitting FortiOS,‚Äù the company noted.</p>

<p>‚ÄúInstead, it was consistently targeting our FortiManager.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis indicated a shift in attacker behavior ‚Äì potentially the same infrastructure or toolset pivoting to a new Fortinet-facing service.‚Äù
On top of that, a deeper examination of the historical data associated with the post-August 5 TCP fingerprint has uncovered an earlier spike in June featuring a unique client signature that resolved to a FortiGate device in a residential ISP block managed by Pilot Fiber Inc. This has raised the possibility that the brute-force tooling was either initially tested or launched from a home network. An alternative hypothesis is the use of a residential proxy. The development comes against the backdrop of findings that spikes in malicious activity are often followed by the disclosure of a new CVE affecting the same technology within six weeks.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThese patterns were exclusive to enterprise edge technologies like VPNs, firewalls, and remote access tools ‚Äì the same kinds of systems increasingly targeted by advanced threat actors,‚Äù the company
noted
in its Early Warning Signals report published late last month. The Hacker News has reached out to Fortinet for further comment, and we will update if we hear back. Found this article interesting? Follow us on

<h2 id="cybercrime-groups-shinyhunters-scattered-spider-join-forces-in-extortion-attacks-on-businesses"><a id="article-10"></a>Cybercrime Groups ShinyHunters, Scattered Spider Join Forces in Extortion Attacks on Businesses</h2>

<p>An ongoing data extortion campaign targeting Salesforce customers may soon turn its attention to financial services and technology service providers, as ShinyHunters and Scattered Spider appear to be working hand in hand, new findings show. ‚ÄúThis latest wave of ShinyHunters-attributed attacks reveals a dramatic shift in tactics, moving beyond the group‚Äôs previous credential theft and database exploitation,‚Äù ReliaQuest
said
in a report shared with The Hacker News. These include the use of adoption of tactics that mirror those of
Scattered Spider
, such as highly-targeted
vishing
(aka
voice phishing
) and social engineering attacks, leveraging apps that masquerade as legitimate tools, employing Okta-themed phishing pages to trick victims into entering credentials during vishing, and VPN obfuscation for data exfiltration. ShinyHunters
, which first emerged in 2020, is a financially motivated threat group that has orchestrated a
series of data breaches
targeting major corporations and monetizing them on cybercrime forums like RaidForums and BreachForums.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the ShinyHunters persona has been a
key participant
in these platforms both as a contributor and administrator. ‚ÄúThe ShinyHunters persona partnered with Baphomet to relaunch the second instance of BreachForums (v2) in June 2023 and later launched the June 2025 instance (v4) alone,‚Äù Sophos
noted
in a recent report. ‚ÄúThe interim version (v3) abruptly disappeared in April 2025, and the cause is unclear.‚Äù
While the relaunch of the forum was short-lived and the bulletin board went offline around June 9, the threat actor has since been
linked
to attacks targeting Salesforce instances globally, a cluster of extortion-related activity that Google is tracking under the moniker UNC6240. Coinciding with these developments was the
arrest
of four individuals suspected of running BreachForums, including ShinyHunters, by French law enforcement authorities.</p>

<p>However, the threat actor
told
DataBreaches.Net that ‚ÄúFrance rushed to make FALSE, INACCURATE arrests,‚Äù raising the possibility that an ‚Äúassociate‚Äù member may have been caught. And that‚Äôs not all. On August 8, a new Telegram channel
conflating
ShinyHunters,
Scattered Spider
, and
LAPSUS$
called ‚Äúscattered lapsu$ hunters‚Äù emerged, with the channel members also
claiming
to be developing a ransomware-as-a-service solution called ShinySp1d3r that they said will rival LockBit and DragonForce. Three days later, the channel was banned and removed by Telegram.</p>

<p>Both Scattered Spider and LAPSUS$ have ties to a broader, nebulous collective dubbed The Com, a notorious network of experienced English-speaking cybercriminals that‚Äôs known to engage in a wide range of malicious activities, including SIM swapping, extortion, and physical crime. ‚ÄúScattered LAPSUS$ Hunters represents a new phase in cyber extortion where clout and chaos are as much the objectives as money,‚Äù FalconFeeds
said
. ‚ÄúTheir connection to known entities like Scattered Spider and ShinyHunters indicates this is less a ‚Äúnew‚Äù group than a rebranding and coalescence of existing threat actors responding to recent law enforcement heat.‚Äù
ReliaQuest said it has identified a coordinated set of ticket-themed phishing domains and Salesforce credential harvesting pages that are likely created for similar campaigns targeting Salesforce that are aimed at high-profile companies across various industry verticals. These domains, the company said, were registered using infrastructure typically associated with phishing kits commonly used to host single sign-on (SSO) login pages ‚Äì a hallmark of Scattered Spider‚Äôs attacks
impersonating
Okta sign-in pages.</p>

<p>Furthermore, an analysis of over 700 domains registered in 2025 that matched Scattered Spider phishing patterns has revealed that domain registrations targeting financial companies have increased by 12% since July 2025, while targeting of technology firms has decreased by 5%, suggesting that banks, insurance companies and financial services could be next in line. The tactical overlaps aside, that the two groups may be collaborating is borne out by the fact that they have targeted the same sectors (i.e., retail, insurance, and aviation) around the same time. ‚ÄúSupporting this theory is evidence such as the appearance of a BreachForums‚Äô user with the alias ‚ÄòSp1d3rHunters,‚Äô who was linked to a past ShinyHunters breach, as well as overlapping domain registration patterns,‚Äù researchers Kimberley Bromley and Ivan Righi said, adding the account was created in May 2024. ‚ÄúIf these connections are legitimate, they suggest that collaboration or overlap between ShinyHunters and Scattered Spider may have been ongoing for more than a year.</p>

<p>The synchronized timing and similar targeting of these previous attacks strongly support the likelihood of coordinated efforts between the two groups.‚Äù
Update
The threat actor collective ShinyHunters has announced that
BreachForums
has been commandeered by international law enforcement agencies, and that the site has been turned into a honeypot. ‚ÄúThe platform is currently being operated by French law enforcement agencies, including the BL2C, in coordination with the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),‚Äù ShinyHunters
claimed
, adding the accounts ‚ÄúHollow,‚Äù ‚ÄúShinyHunters‚Äù are compromised, and that the account ‚ÄúN/A‚Äù has been taken over by a federal agent. ‚ÄúLaw enforcement never figured it out but I am here to confirm ShinyHunters alt accounts were Anastasia and Hollow. Anastasia and Hollow administrator accounts were always controlled by one person, me, ShinyHunters.‚Äù
ShinyHunters‚Äô alleged leader, Shiny, also had a word of caution: ‚ÄúIf BreachForums remains online following this notice, it is operating as a honeypot under the control of multiple international law enforcement agencies.</p>

<p>BreachForums will not be returning under legitimate operation. Any reappearance of the site should be regarded as a law enforcement trap.‚Äù

<h2 id="new-curly-comrades-apt-using-ngen-com-hijacking-in-georgia-moldova-attacks"><a id="article-11"></a>New ‚ÄòCurly COMrades‚Äô APT Using NGEN COM Hijacking in Georgia, Moldova Attacks</h2>

<p>A previously undocumented threat actor dubbed
Curly COMrades
has been observed targeting entities in Georgia and Moldova as part of a cyber espionage campaign designed to facilitate long-term access to target networks. ‚ÄúThey repeatedly tried to extract the NTDS database from domain controllers ‚Äì the primary repository for user password hashes and authentication data in a Windows network,‚Äù Bitdefender
said
in a report shared with The Hacker News. ‚ÄúAdditionally, they attempted to dump LSASS memory from specific systems to recover active user credentials, potentially plain-text passwords, from machines where users were logged on.‚Äù
The activity, tracked by the Romanian cybersecurity company since mid-2024, has singled out judicial and government bodies in Georgia, as well as an energy distribution company in Moldova. ‚ÄúRegarding the timeline, while we have been tracking the campaign since mid-2024, our analysis of the artifacts indicates that activity began earlier,‚Äù Martin Zugec, technical solutions director at Bitdefender, told the publication.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe earliest confirmed date we have for the use of the MucorAgent malware is November 2023, though it is highly probable that the group was active before that time.‚Äù
Curly COMrades are assessed to be operating with goals that are aligned with Russia‚Äôs geopolitical strategy. It gets its name from the heavy reliance on the curl utility for command-and-control (C2) and data transfer, and the hijacking of the component object model (COM) objects. The end goal of the attacks is to enable long-term access to carry out reconnaissance and credential theft, and leverage that information to burrow deeper into the network, collect data using custom tools, and exfiltrate to attacker-controlled infrastructure. ‚ÄúThe overall behavior indicates a methodical approach in which the attackers combined standard attack techniques with tailored implementations to blend into legitimate system activity,‚Äù the company pointed out.</p>

<p>‚ÄúTheir operations were characterized by repeated trial-and-error, use of redundant methods, and incremental setup steps - all aimed at maintaining a resilient and low-noise foothold across multiple systems.‚Äù
A notable aspect of the attacks is the use of legitimate tools like
Resocks
, SSH, and
Stunnel
to create multiple conduits into internal networks and remotely execute commands using the stolen credentials. Another proxy tool deployed besides Resocks is
SOCKS5
. The exact initial access vector employed by the threat actor is currently not known. Persistent access to the infected endpoints is accomplished by means of a bespoke backdoor called MucorAgent, which hijacks class identifiers (
CLSIDs
) ‚Äì globally unique identifiers that identify a COM class object ‚Äì to target Native Image Generator (
Ngen
), an ahead-of-time compilation service that‚Äôs part of the .NET Framework.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNgen, a default Windows .NET Framework component that pre-compiles assemblies, provides a mechanism for persistence via a disabled scheduled task,‚Äù Bitdefender noted. ‚ÄúThis task appears inactive, yet the operating system occasionally enables and executes it at unpredictable intervals (such as during system idle times or new application deployments), making it a great mechanism for restoring access covertly.‚Äù
Abusing the CLSID linked to Ngen underscores the adversary‚Äôs technical prowess, while granting them the ability to execute malicious commands under the highly privileged SYSTEM account. It‚Äôs suspected that there likely exists a more reliable mechanism for executing the specific task given the overall unpredictability associated with Ngen. A modular .NET implant, MucorAgent is launched via a three-stage process and is capable of executing an encrypted PowerShell script and uploading the output to a designated server.</p>

<p>Bitdefender said it did not recover any other PowerShell payloads. ‚ÄúThe design of the MucorAgent suggests that it was likely intended to function as a backdoor capable of executing payloads on a periodic basis,‚Äù the company explained. ‚ÄúEach encrypted payload is deleted after being loaded into memory, and no additional mechanism for regularly delivering new payloads was identified.‚Äù
Also weaponized by Curly COMrades are legitimate-but-compromised websites for use as relays during C2 communications and data exfiltration in a bid to fly under the radar by blending malicious traffic with normal network activity. Some of the other tools observed in the attacks are listed below -
CurlCat, which is used to facilitate bidirectional data transfer between standard input and output streams (STDIN and STDOUT) and C2 server over HTTPS by routing the traffic through a compromised site
RuRat, a legitimate Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) program for persistent access
Mimikatz, which is used to extract credentials from memory
Various built-in commands like netstat, tasklist, systeminfo, ipconfig, and ping to conduct discovery
Powershell scripts that use curl to exfiltrate stolen data (e.g., credentials, domain information, and internal application data)
‚ÄúThe campaign analyzed revealed a highly persistent and adaptable threat actor employing a wide range of known and customized techniques to establish and maintain long-term access within targeted environments,‚Äù Bitdefender said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe attackers relied heavily on publicly available tools, open-source projects, and LOLBins, showing a preference for stealth, flexibility, and minimal detection rather than exploiting novel vulnerabilities.‚Äù

<h2 id="the-ultimate-battle-enterprise-browsers-vs-secure-browser-extensions"><a id="article-12"></a>The Ultimate Battle: Enterprise Browsers vs. Secure Browser Extensions</h2>

<p>Most security tools can‚Äôt see what happens inside the browser, but that‚Äôs where the majority of work, and risk, now lives. Security leaders deciding how to close that gap often face a choice: deploy a dedicated Enterprise Browser or add an enterprise-grade control layer to the browsers employees already use and trust. The Ultimate Battle: Enterprise Browsers vs. Enterprise Browser Extensions
examines this choice across nine ‚Äúrounds‚Äù: adoption, data protection, BYOD, productivity, management overhead, remote access, Zero Trust alignment, supply-chain security, and future-readiness, to show where each approach excels, and where trade-offs emerge.</p>

<p>Each round uses practical, enterprise scenarios to compare the two models, making it easier to see not just what they can do, but how they perform at scale. The Browser Is Now the Workspace
The browser has become the primary workspace for enterprise users. It is where sensitive data is created, accessed, and moved through copy/paste actions, form submissions, uploads, downloads, and increasingly through GenAI prompts. Default-browser habits are deeply ingrained.</p>

<p>Forcing a switch can slow adoption, especially in hybrid environments where unmanaged devices and contractors play a role. Extension ecosystems are both valuable and risky. They expand functionality but also widen the potential attack surface. The guide makes clear that neither Enterprise Browsers nor Enterprise Browser Extensions replace the rest of the security stack, instead, each addresses the in-session gap in a different way.</p>

<p>One of the clearest examples of that gap is how GenAI usage plays out in the browser. GenAI: The Use Case That Tests Both Models
Enterprise adoption of GenAI tools has introduced high-impact, in-session risks for browser security:
Proprietary code, business plans, and sensitive records can be pasted into prompts with no audit trail. Identity context matters, controls must distinguish work from personal accounts in real time. Coverage must extend to unmanaged devices, third parties, and temporary access users.</p>

<p>Extension governance must balance productivity with the ability to detect and restrict risky behavior. The guide uses scenarios like these to stress-test both approaches in multiple rounds, revealing where coverage, control depth, and operational overhead diverge. Enterprise Browser vs. Secure Browser Extension: Side-by-Side Comparison in Nine Rounds
The Ultimate Battle
organizes the comparison into nine operationally relevant rounds.</p>

<p>Rather than listing features, it tests how each model responds to real conditions, from enabling BYOD access without weakening data-in-use controls to managing risky extensions without disrupting workflows. Where the differences show most clearly:
Coverage
Enterprise Browser:
Strong control inside its own environment, but adoption depends on users switching defaults and keeping sensitive activity within the EB. Secure Browser Extension:
Runs in mainstream browsers (Chrome/Edge) to cover managed, unmanaged, and contractor devices without changing the user‚Äôs primary workflow. Control &amp; Enforcement
Enterprise Browser:
Deep guardrails within the EB, including session isolation and strict separation of work and personal contexts.</p>

<p>Enterprise Browser Extension:
DOM-level visibility to apply warnings, redactions, or blocks on copy/paste, form fills, uploads, downloads, and GenAI prompts; policies can be identity-bound to differentiate corporate and personal activity. Integration &amp; Operations
Enterprise Browser:
Integrates cleanly while usage stays inside the EB, but requires parallel browser management and related support. Enterprise Browser Extension:
Streams browser-layer telemetry to SIEM/XDR, influences IAM/ZTNA decisions, and updates centrally without retraining users on a new browser. Making the Enterprise Browser vs.</p>

<p>Secure Browser Extension Decision
The guide is designed to help security teams turn abstract pros and cons into a decision that fits their environment and risk profile. The choice between an Enterprise Browser and an Enterprise Browser Extension is not purely technical, it‚Äôs about balancing depth of control with breadth of coverage, while factoring in adoption patterns and long-term manageability. The comparison document
presents these trade-offs in a structured, scenario-driven format, enabling teams to map them to their own environments and make an informed call. Download the full comparison
