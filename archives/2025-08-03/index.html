<h2 id="cl-sta-0969-installs-covert-malware-in-telecom-networks-during-10-month-espionage-campaign"><a id="article-1"></a>CL-STA-0969 Installs Covert Malware in Telecom Networks During 10-Month Espionage Campaign</h2>

<p>Telecommunications organizations in Southeast Asia have been targeted by a state-sponsored threat actor known as
CL-STA-0969
to facilitate remote control over compromised networks. Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 said it observed multiple incidents in the region, including one aimed at critical telecommunications infrastructure between February and November 2024. The attacks are characterized by the use of several tools to enable remote access, as well as the deployment of Cordscan, which can collect location data from mobile devices. However, the cybersecurity company said it found no evidence of data exfiltration from the networks and systems it investigated.</p>

<p>Nor were any efforts made by the attackers to track or communicate with target devices within mobile networks. ‚ÄúThe threat actor behind CL-STA-0969 maintained high operational security (OPSEC) and employed various defense evasion techniques to avoid detection,‚Äù security researchers Renzon Cruz, Nicolas Bareil, and Navin Thomas
said
. CL-STA-0969, per Unit 42, shares significant overlaps with a cluster tracked by CrowdStrike under the name
Liminal Panda
, a China-nexus espionage group that has been attributed to attacks directed against telecommunications entities in South Asia and Africa since at least 2020 with the goal of intelligence gathering. It‚Äôs worth noting that some aspects of Liminal Panda‚Äôs tradecraft were previously attributed to another threat actor called
LightBasin
(aka UNC1945), which has also singled out the telecom sector since 2016.</p>

<p>LightBasin, for its part, overlaps with a third cluster dubbed
UNC2891
, a financially motivated crew known for its attacks on Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) infrastructure. ‚ÄúWhile this cluster significantly overlaps with Liminal Panda, we have also observed overlaps in attacker tooling with other reported groups and activity clusters, including Light Basin,
UNC3886
, UNC2891, and UNC1945,‚Äù the researchers pointed out. In at least one case, CL-STA-0969 is believed to have employed brute-force attacks against SSH authentication mechanisms for initial compromise, leveraging the access to drop various implants such as -
AuthDoor
, a malicious Pluggable Authentication Module (
PAM
) that works similar to SLAPSTICK (originally attributed to UNC1945) to conduct credential theft and provide persistent access to the compromised host via a hard-coded magic password
Cordscan
, a network scanning and packet capture utility (previously attributed to Liminal Panda)
GTPDOOR
, a malware explicitly
designed
to be deployed in telecom networks that are adjacent to GPRS roaming exchanges
EchoBackdoor
, a passive backdoor that listens for ICMP echo request packets containing command-and-control (C2) instructions to extract the command and send the results of the execution back to the server via an unencrypted ICMP Echo Reply packet
Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) Emulator (
sgsnemu
)
, an emulation software to tunnel traffic via the telecommunications network and bypass firewall restrictions (previously attributed to Liminal Panda)
ChronosRAT
, a modular ELF binary that‚Äôs capable of shellcode execution, file operations, keylogging, port forwarding, remote shell, screenshot capture, and proxy capabilities
NoDepDNS
(internally referred to as MyDns), a Golang backdoor that creates a raw socket and passively listens for UDP traffic on port 53 to parse incoming commands via DNS messages
‚ÄúCL-STA-0969 leveraged different shell scripts that established a reverse SSH tunnel along with other functionalities,‚Äù Unit 42 researchers noted. ‚ÄúCL-STA-0969 systematically clears logs and deletes executables when they are no longer needed, to maintain a high degree of OPSEC.‚Äù
Adding to the already broad portfolio of malicious tools that the threat actor has deployed are
Microsocks proxy
, Fast Reverse Proxy (
FRP
),
FScan
,
Responder
, and
ProxyChains
, as well as programs to exploit flaws in Linux and UNIX-based systems (CVE-2016-5195, CVE-2021-4034, and CVE-2021-3156) to achieve privilege escalation.</p>

<p>Besides using a combination of bespoke and publicly available tooling, the threat actors have been found to adopt a number of strategies to fly under the radar. This encompasses DNS tunneling of traffic, routing traffic through compromised mobile operators, erasing authentication logs, disabling Security-Enhanced Linux (
SELinux
), and disguising process names with convincing names that match the target environment. ‚ÄúCL-STA-0969 demonstrates a deep understanding of telecommunications protocols and infrastructure,‚Äù Unit 42 said. ‚ÄúIts malware, tools and techniques reveal a calculated effort to maintain persistent, stealthy access.</p>

<p>It achieved this by proxying traffic through other telecom nodes, tunneling data using less-scrutinized protocols and employing various defense evasion techniques.‚Äù
China Accuses U.S. Agencies of Targeting Military and Research Institutions
The disclosure comes as the National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team/Coordination Center of China (CNCERT)
accused
U.S. intelligence agencies of weaponizing a Microsoft Exchange zero-day exploit to steal defense-related information and hijack more than 50 devices belonging to a ‚Äúmajor Chinese military enterprise‚Äù between July 2022 and July 2023. The agency also said high-tech military-related universities, scientific research institutes, and enterprises in the country were targeted as part of these attacks to siphon valuable data from compromised hosts.</p>

<p>Among those targeted was a Chinese military enterprise in the communications and satellite internet sectors that was attacked from July to November of 2024 by exploiting vulnerabilities in electronic file systems, CNCERT alleged. The attribution effort
mirrors tactics from the West
, which has repeatedly blamed China for major cyber attacks, counting the latest zero-day exploitation of Microsoft SharePoint Server. Asked last month about Chinese hacking into U.S. telecom systems and theft of intellectual property on Fox News, U.S.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump
said
, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think we do that to them? We do. We do a lot of things. That‚Äôs the way the world works.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a nasty world.‚Äù

<h2 id="new-plague-pam-backdoor-exposes-critical-linux-systems-to-silent-credential-theft"><a id="article-2"></a>New ‚ÄòPlague‚Äô PAM Backdoor Exposes Critical Linux Systems to Silent Credential Theft</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have flagged a previously undocumented Linux backdoor dubbed
Plague
that has managed to evade detection for a year. ‚ÄúThe implant is built as a malicious
PAM
(Pluggable Authentication Module), enabling attackers to silently bypass system authentication and gain persistent SSH access,‚Äù Nextron Systems researcher Pierre-Henri Pezier
said
. Pluggable Authentication Modules refers to a suite of shared libraries used to manage user authentication to applications and services in Linux and UNIX-based systems. Given that PAM modules are loaded into privileged authentication processes, a rogue PAM can
enable
theft of user credentials, bypass authentication checks, and remain undetected by security tools.</p>

<p>The cybersecurity company said it uncovered multiple Plague artifacts uploaded to VirusTotal since July 29, 2024, with none of them detected by antimalware engines as malicious. What‚Äôs more, the presence of several samples signals active development of the malware by the unknown threat actors behind it. Plague boasts of four prominent features: Static credentials to allow covert access, resist analysis and reverse engineering using anti-debugging and string obfuscation; and enhanced stealth by erasing evidence of an SSH session. This, in turn, is accomplished by unsetting environment variables such as
SSH_CONNECTION and SSH_CLIENT
using unsetenv, and redirecting
HISTFILE
to /dev/null to prevent shell command logging, in order otherwise avoid leaving an audit trail.</p>

<p>‚ÄúPlague integrates deeply into the authentication stack, survives system updates, and leaves almost no forensic traces,‚Äù Pezier noted. ‚ÄúCombined with layered obfuscation and environment tampering, this makes it exceptionally hard to detect using traditional tools.‚Äù

<h2 id="akira-ransomware-exploits-sonicwall-vpns-in-likely-zero-day-attack-on-fully-patched-devices"><a id="article-3"></a>Akira Ransomware Exploits SonicWall VPNs in Likely Zero-Day Attack on Fully-Patched Devices</h2>

<p>SonicWall SSL VPN devices have become the target of Akira ransomware attacks as part of a newfound surge in activity observed in late July 2025. ‚ÄúIn the intrusions reviewed, multiple pre-ransomware intrusions were observed within a short period of time, each involving VPN access through SonicWall SSL VPNs,‚Äù Arctic Wolf Labs researcher Julian Tuin
said
in a report. The cybersecurity company suggested that the attacks could be exploiting an as-yet-undetermined security flaw in the appliances, meaning a zero-day vulnerability, given that some of the incidents affected fully-patched SonicWall devices. However, the possibility of credential-based attacks for initial access hasn‚Äôt been ruled out.</p>

<p>The uptick in attacks involving SonicWall SSL VPNs was first registered on July 15, 2025, although Arctic Wolf said that it has observed similar malicious VPN logins
as far back as October 2024
, suggesting sustained efforts to target the devices. ‚ÄúA short interval was observed between initial SSL VPN account access and ransomware encryption,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúIn contrast with legitimate VPN logins which typically originate from networks operated by broadband internet service providers, ransomware groups often use Virtual Private Server hosting for VPN authentication in compromised environments.‚Äù
Queries sent to SonicWall for further details on the activity did not elicit a response until the publishing of this article. As mitigations, organizations are advised to consider disabling the SonicWall SSL VPN service until a patch is made available and deployed, given the likelihood of a zero-day vulnerability.</p>

<p>Other best practices include enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for remote access, deleting inactive or unused local firewall user accounts, and following password hygiene. As of early 2024, Akira ransomware actors are
estimated
to have extorted approximately $42 million in illicit proceeds after targeting more than 250 victims. It first emerged in March 2023. Statistics shared by Check Point show that Akira was the second most active group in the second quarter of 2025 after Qilin, claiming 143 victims during the time period.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAkira ransomware maintains a special focus on Italy, with 10% of its victims from Italian companies compared to 3% in the general ecosystem,‚Äù the cybersecurity company

<h2 id="cursor-ai-code-editor-fixed-flaw-allowing-attackers-to-run-commands-via-prompt-injection"><a id="article-5"></a>Cursor AI Code Editor Fixed Flaw Allowing Attackers to Run Commands via Prompt Injection</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a now-patched, high-severity security flaw in Cursor, a popular artificial intelligence (AI) code editor, that could result in remote code execution (RCE). The vulnerability, tracked as
CVE-2025-54135
(CVSS score: 8.6), has been addressed in
version 1.3
released on July 29, 2025. It has been codenamed CurXecute by Aim‚ÄØLabs, which previously disclosed
EchoLeak
. ‚ÄúCursor runs with developer‚Äëlevel privileges, and when paired with an MCP server that fetches untrusted external data, that data can redirect the agent‚Äôs control flow and exploit those privileges,‚Äù the Aim Labs Team
said
in a report shared with The Hacker News.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBy feeding poisoned data to the agent via MCP, an attacker can gain full remote code execution under the user privileges, and achieve any number of things, including opportunities for ransomware, data theft, AI manipulation and hallucinations, etc.‚Äù
In other words, the remote code execution can triggered by a single externally‚Äëhosted prompt‚Äëinjection that silently rewrites‚ÄØthe ‚Äú~/.cursor/mcp.json‚Äù file and runs attacker‚Äëcontrolled commands. The vulnerability is similar to EchoLeak in that the tools, which are exposed by Model Control Protocol (MCP) servers for use by AI models and facilitate interaction with external systems, such as querying databases or invoking APIs, could fetch untrusted data that can poison the agent‚Äôs expected behavior. Specifically, Aim Security found that the
mcp.json file
used to configure custom MCP servers in Cursor can trigger the execution of any new entry (e.g., adding a Slack MCP server) without requiring any confirmation. This
auto-run mode
is particularly dangerous because it can lead to the automatic execution of a malicious payload that‚Äôs injected by the attacker via a Slack message.</p>

<p>The attack sequence proceeds as follows -
User adds Slack MCP server via Cursor UI
Attacker posts message in a public Slack channel with the command injection payload
Victim opens a new chat and asks Cursor‚Äôs agent to use the newly configured Slack MCP server to summarize their messages in a prompt: ‚ÄúUse Slack tools to summarize my messages‚Äù
The agent encounters a specially crafted message designed to inject malicious commands to its context, for instance, altering the configuration file to add another MCP server containing a rogue instruction (‚Äútouch ~/&lt;file_containing_RCE_payload‚Äù)
‚ÄúThe core cause of the flaw is that new entries to the global MCP JSON file are starting automatically,‚Äù Aim Security said. ‚ÄúEven if the edit is rejected, the code execution had already happened.‚Äù
The entire attack is noteworthy for its simplicity. But it also highlights how AI-assisted tools can open up new attack surfaces when processing external content, in this case, any third-party MCP server. ‚ÄúAs AI agents keep bridging external, internal, and interactive worlds, security models must assume external context may affect the agent runtime - and monitor every hop,‚Äù the company added.</p>

<p>Version 1.3 of Cursor also addresses another issue with auto-run mode that can easily circumvent the platform‚Äôs denylist-based protections using methods like Base64-encoding, shell scripts, and enclosing shell commands within quotes (e.g., ‚Äúe‚Äùcho bypass) to execute unsafe commands. Following responsible disclosure by the BackSlash Research Team, Cursor has taken the step of altogether deprecating the denylist feature for auto-run in favor of an allowlist. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt expect the built-in security solutions provided by
vibe coding platforms
to be comprehensive or foolproof,‚Äù researchers Mustafa Naamneh and Micah Gold
said
. ‚ÄúThe onus is on end-user organizations to ensure agentic systems are equipped with proper guardrails.‚Äù
The disclosure comes as HiddenLayer also found that Cursor‚Äôs ineffective denylist approach can be weaponized by embedding hidden malicious instructions with a GitHub README.md file, allowing an attacker to steal API keys, SSH credentials, and even run blocked system commands.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhen the victim viewed the project on GitHub, the prompt injection was not visible, and they asked Cursor to git clone the project and help them set it up, a common occurrence for an IDE-based agentic system,‚Äù researchers Kasimir Schulz, Kenneth Yeung, and Tom Bonner
noted
. ‚ÄúHowever, after cloning the project and reviewing the readme to see the instructions to set up the project, the prompt injection took over the AI model and forced it to use the grep tool to find any keys in the user‚Äôs workspace before exfiltrating the keys with curl.‚Äù
HiddenLayer said it also found additional weaknesses that could be abused to leak Cursor‚Äôs system prompt by overriding the base URL provided for OpenAI API requests to a proxied model, as well as exfiltrate a user‚Äôs private SSH keys by leveraging two benign tools, read_file and create_diagram, in what‚Äôs called a tool combination attack. This essentially involves inserting a prompt injection command within a GitHub README.md file that‚Äôs parsed by Cursor when the victim user asks the code editor to summarize the file, resulting in the execution of the command. The hidden instruction, for its part, uses the read_file tool to read private SSH keys belonging to the user and then utilizes the create_diagram tool to exfiltrate the keys to an attacker-controlled webhook.site URL.</p>

<p>All the identified shortcomings have been remediated by Cursor in version 1.3. News of various vulnerabilities in Cursor comes as Tracebit devised an attack targeting Google‚Äôs
Gemini CLI
, an open-source command-line tool fine-tuned for coding tasks, that exploited a default configuration of the tool to surreptitiously exfiltrate sensitive data to an attacker-controlled server using curl. Like observed in the case of Cursor, the attack requires the victim to (1) instruct Gemini CLI to interact with an attacker-created GitHub codebase containing a nefarious
indirect prompt injection
in the
GEMINI.md context file
and (2) add a benign command to an allowlist (e.g., grep). ‚ÄúPrompt injection targeting these elements, together with significant validation and display issues within Gemini CLI could cause undetectable arbitrary code execution,‚Äù Tracebit founder and CTO Sam Cox
said
.</p>

<p>To mitigate the risk posed by the attack, Gemini CLI users are advised to upgrade their installations to
version 0.1.14
shipped on July 25, 2025. Found this article interesting? Follow us on

<h2 id="attackers-use-fake-oauth-apps-with-tycoon-kit-to-breach-microsoft-365-accounts"><a id="article-7"></a>Attackers Use Fake OAuth Apps with Tycoon Kit to Breach Microsoft 365 Accounts</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have detailed a new cluster of activity where threat actors are impersonating enterprises with fake
Microsoft OAuth applications
to facilitate credential harvesting as part of account takeover attacks. ‚ÄúThe fake Microsoft 365 applications impersonate various companies, including RingCentral, SharePoint, Adobe, and Docusign,‚Äù Proofpoint
said
in a Thursday report. The ongoing campaign, first detected in early 2025, is designed to use the OAuth applications as a gateway to obtain unauthorized access to users‚Äô Microsoft 365 accounts by means of
phishing kits
like
Tycoon
and ODx that are capable of conducting multi-factor authentication (MFA) phishing. The enterprise security company said it observed the approach being used in email campaigns with more than 50 impersonated applications.</p>

<p>The attacks begin with phishing emails sent from compromised accounts and aim to trick recipients into clicking on URLs under the pretext of sharing requests for quotes (RFQ) or business contract agreements. Clicking on these links directs the victim to a Microsoft OAuth page for an application named ‚ÄúiLSMART‚Äù that asks them to grant it permissions to view their basic profile and maintain continued access to the data that they have been granted access to. What makes this attack notable is the impersonation of ILSMart, a legitimate online marketplace for aviation, marine, and defense industries to buy and sell parts and repair services. ‚ÄúThe applications‚Äô permissions would provide limited use to an attacker, but it is used for setting up the next stage of the attack,‚Äù Proofpoint said.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether the target accepted or denied the permissions requested, they are first redirected to a CAPTCHA page and then to a phony Microsoft account authentication page once the verification is complete. This fake Microsoft page makes use of adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) phishing techniques powered by the Tycoon Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS) platform to harvest the victim‚Äôs credentials and MFA codes. As recently as last month, Proofpoint said it detected another campaign impersonating Adobe in which the emails are sent via Twilio SendGrid, an email marketing platform, and are engineered with the same goal in mind: To gain user authorization or trigger a cancellation flow that redirects the victim to a phishing page. The campaign represents just a drop in the bucket when compared to overall Tycoon-related activity, with the multiple clusters leveraging the toolkit to perform account takeover attacks.</p>

<p>In 2025 alone, attempted account compromises affecting nearly 3,000 user accounts spanning more than 900 Microsoft 365 environments have been observed. ‚ÄúThreat actors are creating increasingly innovative attack chains in an attempt to bypass detections and obtain access to organizations globally,‚Äù the company said, adding it ‚Äúanticipates threat actors will increasingly target users‚Äô identity, with AiTM credential phishing becoming the criminal industry standard.‚Äù
As of last month, Microsoft has
announced
plans to update default settings to improve security by blocking legacy authentication protocols and requiring admin consent for third-party app access. The updates are expected to be completed by August 2025. ‚ÄúThis update will have a positive impact on the landscape overall and will hamstring threat actors that use this technique,‚Äù Proofpoint pointed out.</p>

<p>The disclosure follows Microsoft‚Äôs
decision
to disable external workbook links to blocked file types by default between October 2025 and July 2026 in an attempt to enhance workbook security. The findings also come as spear-phishing emails bearing purported payment receipts are used to deploy by means of an AutoIt-based injector a piece of .NET malware called
VIP Keylogger
that can steal sensitive data from compromised hosts, Seqrite
said
. Over the course of several months, spam campaigns have been spotted concealing installation links to remote desktop software inside PDF files so as to bypass email and malware defenses. The campaign is believed to have been ongoing since November 2024, primarily targeting entities in France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and Germany.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThese PDFs are often disguised to look like invoices, contracts, or property listings to enhance credibility and lure victims into clicking the embedded link,‚Äù WithSecure
said
. ‚ÄúThis design was intended to create the illusion of legitimate content that has been obscured, prompting the victim to install a program. In this case, the program was FleetDeck RMM.‚Äù
Other Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) tools deployed as part of the activity cluster include Action1, OptiTune, Bluetrait, Syncro, SuperOps, Atera, and ScreenConnect. ‚ÄúAlthough no post-infection payloads have been observed, the use of RMM tools strongly suggests their role as an initial access vector, potentially enabling further malicious activity,‚Äù the Finnish company added.</p>

<p>‚ÄúRansomware operators in particular have favoured this approach.‚Äù

the library, said the malicious features are advertised directly in the source code, calling it an ‚Äúenhanced stealth wallet drainer.‚Äù
Specifically, the behavior is triggered as part of a postinstall script that drops its payload within hidden directories across Windows, Linux, and macOS systems, and then proceeds to connect to a command-and-control (C2) server at ‚Äúsweeper-monitor-production.up.railway[.]app.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe script generates a unique machine ID code for the compromised host and shares that with the C2 server,‚Äù Paul McCarty, head of research at Safety, said, noting that the C2 server lists two compromised machines.</p>

<p>In the npm ecosystem, postinstall scripts are often overlooked attack vectors‚Äîthey run automatically after a package is installed, meaning users can be compromised without ever executing the package manually. This creates a dangerous blind spot, especially in CI/CD environments where dependencies are updated routinely without direct human review. The malware is designed to scan the system for the presence of a wallet file, and if found, it proceeds to drain all funds from the wallet to a hard-coded wallet address on the Solana blockchain. While this is not the first time
cryptocurrency drainers
have been
identified
in open-source repositories, what makes @kodane/patch-manager stand out are clues that suggest the use of Anthropic‚Äôs Claude AI chatbot to generate it.</p>

<p>This includes the presence of emojis, extensive JavaScript console logging messages, well-written and descriptive comments, the README.md markdown file written in a style that‚Äôs consistent with Claude-generated markdown files, and Claude‚Äôs pattern of calling code changes as ‚ÄúEnhanced.‚Äù
The discovery of the npm package highlights ‚Äúhow threat actors are leveraging AI to create more convincing and dangerous malware,‚Äù McCarty said. The incident also underlines growing concerns in software supply chain security, where AI-generated packages may bypass conventional defenses by appearing clean or even helpful. This raises the stakes for package maintainers and security teams, who now need to monitor not just known malware, but increasingly polished, AI-assisted threats that exploit trusted ecosystems like npm.

<h2 id="you-are-what-you-eat-why-your-ai-security-tools-are-only-as-strong-as-the-data-you-feed-them"><a id="article-9"></a>You Are What You Eat: Why Your AI Security Tools Are Only as Strong as the Data You Feed Them</h2>

<p>Just as triathletes know that peak performance requires more than expensive gear, cybersecurity teams are discovering that AI success depends less on the tools they deploy and more on the data that powers them
The junk food problem in cybersecurity
Imagine a triathlete who spares no expense on equipment‚Äîcarbon fiber bikes, hydrodynamic wetsuits, precision GPS watches‚Äîbut fuels their training with processed snacks and energy drinks. Despite the premium gear, their performance will suffer because their foundation is fundamentally flawed. Triathletes see nutrition as the fourth discipline of their training that can have a significant impact on performance and can even determine race outcomes. Today‚Äôs security operations centers (SOCs) face a similar issue.</p>

<p>They‚Äôre investing heavily in AI-powered detection systems, automated response platforms, and machine learning analytics‚Äîthe equivalent of professional-grade triathlon equipment. But they‚Äôre powering these sophisticated tools with legacy data feeds that lack the richness and context modern AI models need to perform effectively. Just as a triathlete needs to master swimming, cycling, and running in seamless coordination, SOC teams must excel at detection, investigation, and response. However, without their own ‚Äúfourth discipline,‚Äù SOC analysts will be working with sparse endpoint logs, fragmented alert streams, and data silos that don‚Äôt communicate, it‚Äôs like trying to complete a triathlon fueled only by a bag of chips and a beer‚Äîno matter how good your training or equipment, you‚Äôre not crossing the finish line first.</p>

<p>While you may load up on sugar and calories on race day to ensure you have the energy to make it through, that isn‚Äôt a sustainable, long-term regimen that will optimize your body for the best performance. The hidden cost of legacy data diets
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre living through the first wave of an AI revolution, and so far the spotlight has focused on models and applications,‚Äù said Greg Bell, Corelight chief strategy officer. ‚ÄúThat makes sense, because the impacts for cyber defense are going to be huge. But I think there‚Äôs starting to be a dawning realization that ML and GenAI tools are gated by the quality of data they consume.‚Äù
This disconnect between advanced AI capabilities and outdated data infrastructure creates what security professionals are now calling ‚Äúdata debt‚Äù‚Äîthe accumulated cost of building AI systems on foundations that weren‚Äôt designed for machine learning consumption.</p>

<p>Traditional security data often resembles a triathlete‚Äôs training diary filled with incomplete entries: ‚ÄúRan today. Felt okay.‚Äù It provides basic information but lacks the granular metrics, environmental context, and performance correlations that enable genuine improvement. Legacy data feeds typically include:
Sparse endpoint logs
that capture events but miss the behavioral context
Alert-only feeds
that tell you something happened but not the full story
Siloed data sources
that can‚Äôt correlate across systems or time periods
Reactive indicators
that only activate after damage is already done without historical perspectives
Unstructured formats
that require extensive processing before AI models can analyze them
The adversary is already performance-enhanced
While defenders struggle with data that‚Äôs nutritionally deficient for AI consumption, attackers have optimized their approach with the discipline of elite athletes. They‚Äôre leveraging AI to create adaptive attack strategies that are faster, cheaper, and more precisely targeted than ever before by:
Automating reconnaissance
and exploit development to accelerate attack speed
Reducing the cost per attack
, increasing potential threat volume aster
Personalizing approaches
based on AI-gathered intelligence to deliver more targeted attacks
Generating quicker iteration
and improvement of tactics based on what is working
Meanwhile, many SOCs are still trying to defend against these AI-enhanced threats using data equivalent to a 1990s training regimen‚Äîwith just basic heart rate information‚Äîwhen the competition is using comprehensive performance analytics, environmental sensors, and predictive modeling.</p>

<p>This creates an escalating performance gap. As attackers become more sophisticated in their use of AI, the quality of defensive data becomes increasingly critical. Poor data doesn‚Äôt just slow down detection‚Äîit actively undermines the effectiveness of AI security tools, creating blind spots that sophisticated adversaries can exploit. AI-ready data: the performance enhancement SOCs need
The solution lies in fundamentally reimagining security data architecture around what AI models actually need to perform effectively.</p>

<p>This means transitioning from legacy data feeds to what could be called ‚ÄúAI-ready‚Äù data‚Äîinformation that‚Äôs structured, enriched, and optimized specifically for AI analysis and automation. AI-ready data shares characteristics with the comprehensive performance metrics that elite triathletes use to optimize their training. Just as these athletes track everything from power output and cadence to environmental conditions and recovery markers, AI-ready security data captures not just what happened, but the full context surrounding each event. This includes network telemetry that provides visibility before encryption obscures the evidence, comprehensive metadata that reveals behavioral patterns, and structured formats that AI models can immediately process without extensive preprocessing.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs data that‚Äôs been specifically designed to feed the three critical components of AI-powered security operations. AI-driven threat detection
becomes dramatically more effective when powered by forensic-grade network evidence
that includes full context and real-time collection across on-premise, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments. This enables AI models to identify subtle patterns and anomalies that would be invisible in traditional log formats. AI workflows
transform the analyst experience by providing expert-authored processes enhanced with AI-driven payload analysis, historical context, and session-level summaries.</p>

<p>This is equivalent to having a world-class coach who can instantly analyze performance data and provide specific, actionable guidance for improvement. AI-enabled ecosystem integrations
ensure that AI-ready data flows seamlessly into existing SOC tools‚ÄîSIEMs, SOAR platforms, XDR systems, and data lakes‚Äîwithout requiring custom integrations or format conversions. It‚Äôs automatically compatible with nearly every tool in an analyst‚Äôs arsenal. The compound effect of superior data
The impact of transitioning to AI-ready data creates a compound effect across security operations.</p>

<p>Teams can correlate unusual access patterns and privilege escalations in ephemeral cloud environments, critical for addressing cloud-native threats that traditional tools miss. They gain expanded coverage for novel, evasive, and zero-day threats while enabling faster development of new detections. Perhaps most importantly, analysts can quickly understand incident timelines without parsing raw logs, get plain-language summaries of suspicious behaviors across hosts and sessions, and focus their attention on priority alerts with clear justifications for why each incident matters. ‚ÄúHigh quality, context-rich data is the ‚Äòclean fuel‚Äô AI needs to achieve its full potential,‚Äù added Bell.</p>

<p>‚ÄúModels starved of quality data will inevitably disappoint. As AI augmentation becomes the standard for both attack and defense, organizations that succeed will be the ones that understand a fundamental truth: in the world of AI security, you are what you eat.‚Äù
The training decision every SOC must make
As AI becomes standard for both attack and defense, AI-driven security tools can‚Äôt reach their potential without the right data. Organizations that continue feeding these systems with legacy data may find their significant investment in next-generation technology underperforming against increasingly advanced threats. Those that recognize this isn‚Äôt about replacing existing security investments ‚Äî it‚Äôs about
providing them with the high-quality fuel
to deliver on their promise ‚Äî will be positioned to unlock AI‚Äôs competitive advantage.</p>

<h2 id="storm-2603-deploys-dns-controlled-backdoor-in-warlock-and-lockbit-ransomware-attacks"><a id="article-10"></a>Storm-2603 Deploys DNS-Controlled Backdoor in Warlock and LockBit Ransomware Attacks</h2>

<p>The threat actor linked to the exploitation of the recently disclosed security flaws in Microsoft SharePoint Server is using a bespoke command-and-control (C2) framework called
AK47 C2
(also spelled ak47c2) in its operations. The framework includes at least two different types of clients, HTTP-based and Domain Name System (
DNS
)-based, which have been dubbed AK47HTTP and AK47DNS, respectively, by Check Point Research. The activity has been attributed to
Storm-2603
, which, according to Microsoft, is a suspected China-based threat actor that has leveraged the
SharePoint flaws
‚Äì CVE-2025-49706 and CVE-2025-49704 (aka ToolShell) ‚Äì to deploy Warlock (aka X2anylock) ransomware. A previously unreported threat cluster, evidence gathered following an analysis of VirusTotal artifacts shows that the group may have been active since at least March 2025, deploying ransomware families like
LockBit Black
and Warlock together ‚Äì something that‚Äôs not observed commonly among established e-crime groups.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBased on VirusTotal data, Storm-2603 likely targeted some organizations in Latin America throughout the first half of 2025, in parallel to attacking organizations in APAC,‚Äù Check Point
said
. The attack tools used by the threat actor includes legitimate open-source and Windows utilities like masscan, WinPcap, SharpHostInfo, nxc, and PsExec, as well as a custom backdoor (‚Äúdnsclient.exe‚Äù) that uses DNS for command-and-control with the domain ‚Äúupdate.updatemicfosoft[.]com.‚Äù
The backdoor is part of the AK47 C2 framework, alongside AK47HTTP, that‚Äôs employed to gather host information and parse DNS or HTTP responses from the server and execute them on the infected machine via ‚Äúcmd.exe.‚Äù The initial access pathway used in these attacks are unknown. A point worth mentioning here is that the aforementioned infrastructure was also flagged by Microsoft as used by the threat actor as a C2 server to establish communication with the ‚Äúspinstall0.aspx‚Äù web shell. In addition to the open-source tools, Storm-2603 has been found to distribute three additional payloads -
7z.exe and 7z.dll, the legitimate 7-Zip binary that‚Äôs used to sideload a malicious DLL, which delivers Warlock
bbb.msi, an installer that uses clink_x86.exe to sideload ‚Äúclink_dll_x86.dll,‚Äù which leads to LockBit Black deployment
Check Point said it also discovered another MSI artifact uploaded to VirusTotal in April 2025 that‚Äôs used to launch Warlock and LockBit ransomware, and also drop a custom antivirus killer executable (‚ÄúVMToolsEng.exe‚Äù) that employs the bring your own vulnerable driver (
BYOVD
) technique to
terminate security software
using ServiceMouse.sys, a third-party driver provided by Chinese security vendor Antiy Labs.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Storm-2603‚Äôs exact motivations remain unclear at this stage, making it harder to determine if it‚Äôs espionage-focused or driven by profit motives. However, it bears noting that there have been
instances
where nation-state actors from China, Iran, and North Korea have deployed ransomware on the side. ‚ÄúWe tend to assess it is a financially motivated actor, but with this, we can‚Äôt also exclude the option that this is a dual motivation actor, both espionage and financially motivated,‚Äù Sergey Shykevich, Threat Intelligence Group Manager at Check Point, told The Hacker News. ‚ÄúStorm-2603 leverages BYOVD techniques to disable endpoint defenses and DLL hijacking to deploy multiple ransomware families ‚Äì blurring the lines between APT and criminal ransomware operations,‚Äù Check Point added.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe group also uses open-source tools like PsExec and masscan, signaling a hybrid approach seen increasingly in sophisticated attacks.‚Äù

<h2 id="secret-blizzard-deploys-malware-in-isp-level-aitm-attacks-on-moscow-embassies"><a id="article-11"></a>Secret Blizzard Deploys Malware in ISP-Level AitM Attacks on Moscow Embassies</h2>

<p>The Russian nation-state threat actor known as
Secret Blizzard
has been observed orchestrating a new cyber espionage campaign targeting foreign embassies located in Moscow by means of an adversary-in-the-middle (
AitM
) attack at the Internet Service Provider (ISP) level and delivering a custom malware dubbed ApolloShadow. ‚ÄúApolloShadow has the capability to install a trusted root certificate to trick devices into trusting malicious actor-controlled sites, enabling Secret Blizzard to maintain persistence on diplomatic devices, likely for intelligence collection,‚Äù the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team
said
in a report shared with The Hacker News. The activity is assessed to be ongoing since at least 2024, with the campaign posing a security risk to diplomatic personnel relying on local ISPs or telecommunications services in Russia. Secret Blizzard (formerly Krypton), affiliated with the Russian Federal Security Service, is also tracked by the broader cybersecurity community under the monikers Blue Python, Iron Hunter, Pensive Ursa, Snake, SUMMIT, Uroburos, Turla, Venomous Bear, and Waterbug.</p>

<p>In December 2024, Microsoft and Lumen Technologies Black Lotus Labs
disclosed
the hacking group‚Äôs use of a Pakistan-based threat actor‚Äôs command-and-control (C2) infrastructure to carry out its own attacks as a way to cloud attribution efforts. The adversary has also been
observed
piggybacking on malware associated with other threat actors to deliver its Kazuar backdoor on target devices located in Ukraine. The Windows maker noted that the AitM position is likely facilitated by lawful intercept and includes the installation of root certificates under the guise of Kaspersky antivirus to obtain elevated access to the system. Initial access is achieved by redirecting target devices to threat actor-controlled infrastructure by putting them behind a
captive portal
, leading to the download and execution of the ApolloShadow malware.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOnce behind a captive portal, the Windows Test Connectivity Status Indicator is initiated‚Äîa legitimate service that determines whether a device has internet access by sending an HTTP GET request to hxxp://www.msftconnecttest[.]com/redirect, which should direct to msn[.]com,‚Äù Microsoft said. ‚ÄúOnce the system opens the browser window to this address, the system is redirected to a separate actor-controlled domain that likely displays a certificate validation error, which prompts the target to download and execute ApolloShadow.‚Äù
The malware then beacons host information to the C2 server and runs a binary called CertificateDB.exe should the device not be running on default administrative settings, and retrieves as a second-stage payload an unknown Visual Basic Script. In the last step, the ApolloShadow process launches itself again and presents the user with a user access control (UAC) pop-up window and instructs them to grant it the highest privileges available to the user. ApolloShadow‚Äôs execution path varies if the running process is already running with sufficient elevated privileges, abusing them to set all networks to Private via registry profile changes and create an administrative user with the username UpdatusUser and a hard-coded password, allowing persistent access to the machine.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis induces several changes, including allowing the host device to become discoverable, and relaxing firewall rules to enable file sharing,‚Äù the company said. ‚ÄúWhile we did not see any direct attempts for lateral movement, the main reason for these modifications is likely to reduce the difficulty of lateral movement on the network.‚Äù
Once this step is successfully completed, victims are displayed a window showing that the deployment of the digital certificates is in progress, causing two root certificates to be installed on the machine using the certutil utility. Also dropped is a file called ‚Äúwincert.js‚Äù that allows Mozilla Firefox to trust the root certificates. To defend against Secret Blizzard activity, diplomatic entities operating in Moscow are urged to implement the principle of least privilege (PoLP), periodically review privileged groups, and route all traffic through an encrypted tunnel to a trusted network or use a virtual private network (VPN) service provider.</p>

<h2 id="experts-detect-multi-layer-redirect-tactic-used-to-steal-microsoft-365-login-credentials"><a id="article-12"></a>Experts Detect Multi-Layer Redirect Tactic Used to Steal Microsoft 365 Login Credentials</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a new phishing campaign that conceals malicious payloads by abusing link wrapping services from Proofpoint and Intermedia to bypass defenses. ‚ÄúLink wrapping is designed by vendors like Proofpoint to protect users by routing all clicked URLs through a scanning service, allowing them to block known malicious destinations at the moment of click,‚Äù the Cloudflare Email Security team
said
. ‚ÄúWhile this is effective against known threats, attacks can still succeed if the wrapped link hasn‚Äôt been flagged by the scanner at click time.‚Äù
The activity, observed over the last two months, once again illustrates how threat actors find different ways to
leverage legitimate features and trusted tools
to their advantage and perform malicious actions, in this case, redirecting victims to Microsoft 365 phishing pages. It‚Äôs noteworthy that the abuse of link wrapping involves the attackers gaining unauthorized access to email accounts that already use the feature within an organization, so that any email message containing a malicious URL sent from that account is automatically rewritten with the wrapped link (e.g., urldefense.proofpoint[.]com/v2/url?u=<malicious_website>).</malicious_website></p>

<p>Another important aspect concerns what Cloudflare calls ‚Äúmulti-tiered redirect abuse,‚Äù in which the threat actors first cloak their malicious links using a URL shortening service like Bitly, and then send the shortened link in an email message via a Proofpoint-secured account, causing it to be obscured a second time. This behavior effectively creates a redirection chain, where the URL passes through two levels of obfuscation ‚Äì Bitly and Proofpoint‚Äôs URL Defense ‚Äì before taking the victim to the phishing page. In the attacks observed by the web infrastructure company, the phishing messages masquerade as voicemail notifications, urging recipients to click on a link to listen to them, ultimately directing them to a bogus Microsoft 365 phishing page designed to capture their credentials. Alternate infection chains employ the same technique in emails that notify users of a supposed document received on Microsoft Teams and trick them into clicking on booby-trapped hyperlinks.</p>

<p>A third variation of these attacks impersonates Teams in emails, claiming that they have unread messages and that they can click on the ‚ÄúReply in Teams‚Äù button embedded in the messages to redirect them to credential harvesting pages. ‚ÄúBy cloaking malicious destinations with legitimate urldefense[.]proofpoint[.]com and url[.]emailprotection URLs, these phishing campaigns‚Äô abuse of trusted link wrapping services significantly increases the likelihood of a successful attack,‚Äù Cloudflare said. When contacted by The Hacker News for comment, Proofpoint said it‚Äôs aware of threat actors abusing URL redirects and URL protection in ongoing phishing campaigns, and that it‚Äôs a technique the company has observed from multiple security service providers who provide similar email protection or URL rewrite solutions, such as Cisco and Sophos. The enterprise security firm also noted that it flags these campaigns via its behavioral artificial intelligence (AI) detection engine, and messages bearing such URLs are discarded and the final URLs at the end of the redirect chain are blocked to prevent exploitation.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIn these campaigns, a threat actor can either abuse an open redirect to link to a rewritten URL, or compromise an email account that belongs to someone with some type of email protection,‚Äù Proofpoint threat researchers said. ‚ÄúThen, they send an email with a phishing link to the account they have compromised. The security service rewrites the URL, and the threat actor makes sure the link is not blocked. Then, the threat actor will take the rewritten URL and include it in various redirect chains.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhenever threat actors choose to use a re-written URL from any security service, including Proofpoint, it means that as soon as the security service blocks the final URL, the entire attack chain will be blocked for every recipient of the campaign, whether the recipient was a customer of the security service or not.‚Äù
The development comes amid a
spike
in
phishing
attacks
that
weaponize
Scalable Vector Graphics (
SVG
) files to
get around
traditional anti-spam and anti-phishing protections and initiate multi-stage malware infections.</p>

<p>‚ÄúUnlike JPEG or PNG files, SVG files are written in XML and support JavaScript and HTML code,‚Äù the New Jersey Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Cell (NJCCIC)
said
last month. ‚ÄúThey can contain scripts, hyperlinks, and interactive elements, which can be exploited by embedding malicious code within harmless SVG files.‚Äù
Phishing campaigns have also been observed embedding fake Zoom videoconferencing links in emails that, when clicked, trigger a redirection chain to a fake page that mimics a realistic-looking interface, after which they are served a ‚Äúmeeting connection timed out‚Äù message and taken to a phishing page that prompts them to enter their credentials to rejoin the meeting. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, instead of ‚Äòrejoining,‚Äô the victim‚Äôs credentials along with their IP address, country, and region are exfiltrated via Telegram, a messaging app notorious for ‚Äòsecure, encrypted communications,‚Äô and inevitably sent to the threat actor,‚Äù Cofense
said
in a recent report. (The story was updated after publication to include a response from Proofpoint.)

<h2 id="n-korean-hackers-used-job-lures-cloud-account-access-and-malware-to-steal-millions-in-crypto"><a id="article-13"></a>N. Korean Hackers Used Job Lures, Cloud Account Access, and Malware to Steal Millions in Crypto</h2>

<p>The North Korea-linked threat actor known as
UNC4899
has been attributed to attacks targeting two different organizations by approaching their employees via LinkedIn and Telegram. ‚ÄúUnder the guise of freelance opportunities for software development work, UNC4899 leveraged social engineering techniques to successfully convince the targeted employees to execute malicious Docker containers in their respective workstations,‚Äù Google‚Äôs cloud division
said
[PDF] in its Cloud Threat Horizons Report for H2 2025. UNC4899
overlaps
with activity tracked under the monikers Jade Sleet, PUKCHONG, Slow Pisces, and TraderTraitor. Active since at least 2020, the state-sponsored actor is known for its targeting of cryptocurrency and blockchain industries.</p>

<p>Notably, the hacking group has been implicated in
significant cryptocurrency heists
, including that of Axie Infinity in March 2022 ($625 million), DMM Bitcoin in May 2024 ($308 million), and Bybit in February 2025 ($1.4 billion). Another example that highlights its sophistication is the suspected exploitation of
JumpCloud‚Äôs infrastructure
to target downstream customers within the cryptocurrency vertical. According to DTEX, TraderTraitor is affiliated with the Third Bureau (or Department) of North Korea‚Äôs Reconnaissance General Bureau and is the most prolific of any of the Pyongyang hacking groups when it comes to cryptocurrency theft. Attacks mounted by the threat actor have entailed leveraging job-themed lures or
uploading malicious npm packages
, and then approaching employees at target companies with a lucrative opportunity or asking them to collaborate on a GitHub project that would then lead to the execution of the rogue npm libraries.</p>

<p>‚ÄúTraderTraitor has demonstrated a sustained interest in cloud-centric and cloud-adjacent attack surfaces, often with a final goal of compromising companies that are customers of cloud platforms rather than the platforms themselves,‚Äù cloud security firm Wiz
said
in a detailed report on TraderTraitor this week. The attacks observed by Google Cloud targeted the respective organizations‚Äô Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services (AWS) environments, paving the way for a downloader called GLASSCANNON that‚Äôs then used to serve backdoors like PLOTTWIST and MAZEWIRE that can establish connections with an attacker-controlled server. In the incident involving the Google Cloud environment, the threat actors have been found to employ stolen credentials to interact remotely using Google Cloud CLI over an anonymous VPN service, carrying out extensive reconnaissance and credential theft activities. However, they were thwarted in their efforts due to the multi-factor authentication (MFA) configuration applied to the victim‚Äôs credentials.</p>

<p>‚ÄúUNC4899 eventually determined the victim‚Äôs account had administrative privileges to the Google Cloud project and disabled the MFA requirements,‚Äù Google said. ‚ÄúAfter successfully gaining access to the targeted resources, they immediately re-enabled MFA to evade detection.‚Äù
The intrusion targeting the second victim‚Äôs AWS environment is said to have followed a similar playbook, only this time the attackers used long-term access keys obtained from an
AWS credential file
to interact remotely via AWS CLI. Although the threat actors ran into access control roadblocks that prevented them from performing any sensitive actions, Google said it found evidence that likely indicated the theft of the user‚Äôs session cookies. These cookies were then used to identify relevant CloudFront configurations and S3 buckets.</p>

<p>UNC4899 ‚Äúleveraged the inherent administrative permissions applied to their access to upload and replace existing JavaScript files with those containing malicious code, which were designed to manipulate cryptocurrency functions and trigger a transaction with the cryptocurrency wallet of a target organization,‚Äù Google said. The attacks, in both cases, ended with the threat actors successfully withdrawing several million worth of cryptocurrency, the company added. The development comes as Sonatype said it flagged and blocked 234 unique malware npm and PyPI packages attributed to North Korea‚Äôs Lazarus Group between January and July 2025. Some of these libraries are configured to drop a known credential stealer referred to as
BeaverTail
, which is associated with a long-running campaign dubbed Contagious Interview.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThese packages mimic popular developer tools but function as espionage implants, designed to steal secrets, profile hosts, and open persistent backdoors into critical infrastructure,‚Äù the software supply chain security firm
said
. ‚ÄúThe surge of activity in H1 2025 demonstrates a strategic pivot: Lazarus is now embedding malware directly into open source package registries, namely npm and PyPI, at an alarming rate.‚Äù
Update
Veracode, in a new analysis published on July 31, 2025,
said
it uncovered a dozen malicious packages published by North Korean threat actors as part of a cryptocurrency stealing campaign. The malware is assessed to be a variant of BeaverTail, capable of harvesting system information, exfiltrating data from cryptocurrency wallet apps and browser extensions, and downloading additional Python payloads. None of the identified packages are available for download from npm.</p>

<p>(The story was updated after publication on August 2, 2025, to include additional insights from Veracode.)

<h2 id="ai-driven-trends-in-endpoint-security-what-the-2025-gartner-magic-quadrant-reveals"><a id="article-14"></a>AI-Driven Trends in Endpoint Security: What the 2025 Gartner¬Æ Magic Quadrant‚Ñ¢ Reveals</h2>

<p>Cyber threats and attacks like ransomware continue to increase in volume and complexity with the endpoint typically being the most sought after and valued target. With the rapid expansion and adoption of AI, it is more critical than ever to ensure the endpoint is adequately secured by a platform capable of not just keeping pace, but staying ahead of an ever-evolving threat landscape. SentinelOne‚Äôs steadfast commitment to delivering AI-powered cybersecurity enables global customers and partners to achieve resiliency and reduce risk with real-time, autonomous protection across the entire enterprise ‚Äî all from a single agent and console with a robust, rigorously tested platform that keeps the customer in control. Cybersecurity today isn‚Äôt just about detection‚Äîit‚Äôs about operational continuity under pressure.</p>

<p>For example, endpoint solutions must account for encrypted traffic inspection, policy enforcement during identity compromise, and fast containment across distributed environments. These capabilities are especially critical in industries like healthcare or finance, where seconds can mean regulatory penalties or breached patient records. Gartner recently named SentinelOne a Leader in the
2025 Gartner¬Æ Magic Quadrant for Endpoint Protection Platforms
for the fifth consecutive year. This recognition builds on the Singularity Platform‚Äôs momentum in innovation as the first solution with an AI analyst and the first unified platform delivering EDR, CNAPP, Hyperautomation, and SIEM to be FedRAMP High (the highest level of U.S.</p>

<p>federal cloud security authorization) Authorized. SentinelOne provides protection for organizations of all sizes‚Äîfrom small businesses to global governments and enterprises‚Äîmeeting their unique needs in the face of an increasingly complex cyber landscape. The Singularity Platform secures organizations across any device, any OS, and any cloud, providing industry-leading signal-to-noise so SOC teams can focus on responding as quickly as possible. With advanced XDR, AI SIEM, and CNAPP capabilities, a lightweight agent, and responsible architecture, SentinelOne offers a solution designed for both security and operational resiliency.</p>

<p>Organizations using
Singularity Endpoint and Purple AI detect threats 63% faster, reduce MTTR by 55%
, and lower the likelihood of a security incident by 60%. Customers have reported a 338% ROI over three years, maximizing the value of their security investments while strengthening their endpoint security. For example, a healthcare provider using SentinelOne reported cutting incident response time by over 50% during a phishing-induced ransomware outbreak, thanks to automated rollback and unified visibility across cloud workloads and endpoints. Many teams searching for EDR or XDR platforms are trying to answer: ‚ÄúWill this reduce alert fatigue?‚Äù or ‚ÄúCan it integrate with my SIEM or SOAR stack without more overhead?‚Äù This is where automation must go beyond buzzwords‚Äîreducing manual triage, stitching disconnected signals, and working with existing tools instead of replacing them.</p>

<p>SentinelOne has set the standard in modern endpoint protection since entering the market more than a decade ago, disrupting both traditional antivirus and early next-gen AV approaches. Unlike signature-based protection and cloud-dependent defenses, the platform pioneered the use of static and behavioral AI and machine learning to detect even novel techniques, solve for both online and air-gapped environments, and automate response. These innovations differentiate SentinelOne from traditional AV and even next-gen EDR solutions, offering deeper automation and on-device intelligence compared to competitors that rely heavily on cloud lookups or manual workflows. This innovation, architecture, and design philosophy continues to evolve through Purple AI, advanced behavioral detection models, automated remediation and rollback, XDR capabilities, and more.</p>

<p>The security platform now offers solutions spanning Identity, Cloud, AI SIEM, Hyperautomation, expert-managed detection and response, and a range of threat services. Accelerating the SOC and staying ahead of attacks in the age of AI requires platforms that harness innovation in AI and automation to radically improve detection, triage, and response. SentinelOne‚Äôs platform has long embedded AI and automation as a foundational element. The company continues to develop accessible, compliant AI and automation to transform the SOC.</p>

<p>Behavioral AI and the Future of Cyber Threat Detection
Over the last decade, SentinelOne has advanced behavioral AI detections, automated remediation, and introduced agentic AI for security. Rather than merely assisting analysts, agentic AI‚Äîdefined as a class of autonomous AI systems capable of initiating and executing security actions without human prompting‚Äîautonomously takes action, handles routine tasks, and accelerates decision making while keeping the human operator in control. Purple AI, the platform‚Äôs AI security analyst
, translates natural language questions into powerful threat hunting queries, suggests follow-up questions, recommends next steps, and generates reports and email summaries to accelerate remediation. Built on the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF), a vendor-agnostic standard for unifying data models, Purple AI ensures unified visibility across all security data, enabling fast, precise threat detection.</p>
