<h2 id="confucius-hackers-hit-pakistan-with-new-wooperstealer-and-anondoor-malware"><a id="article-1"></a>Confucius Hackers Hit Pakistan With New WooperStealer and Anondoor Malware</h2>

<p>The threat actor known as Confucius has been attributed to a new phishing campaign that has targeted Pakistan with malware families like WooperStealer and Anondoor. ‚ÄúOver the past decade, Confucius has repeatedly targeted government agencies, military organizations, defense contractors, and critical industries ‚Äì especially in Pakistan ‚Äì using spear-phishing and malicious documents as initial access vectors,‚Äù Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Cara Lin
said
. Confucius
is a
long-running hacking group
that‚Äôs believed to have been active since 2013 and operating across South Asia. Recent campaigns undertaken by the threat actor have employed a Python-based backdoor called Anondoor, signaling an evolution of the group‚Äôs tradecraft and its technical agility.</p>

<p>One of the attack chains documented by Fortinet targeted users in Pakistan sometime in December 2024, tricking recipients into opening a .PPSX file, which then triggers the delivery of WooperStealer using DLL side-loading techniques. A subsequent attack wave observed in March 2025 has been found to employ Windows shortcut (.LNK) files to unleash the malicious WooperStealer DLL, again launched using DLL side-loading, to steal sensitive data from compromised hosts. Another .LNK file spotted in August 2025 also leveraged similar tactics to sideload a rogue DLL, only this time the DLL paves the way for Anondoor, a Python implant that‚Äôs designed to exfiltrate device information to an external server and await further tasks to execute commands, take screenshots, enumerate files and directories, and dump passwords from Google Chrome. It‚Äôs worth noting that the threat actor‚Äôs use of Anondoor was
documented
in July 2025 by Seebug‚Äôs KnownSec 404 Team.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe group has demonstrated strong adaptability, layering obfuscation techniques to evade detection and tailoring its toolset to align with shifting intelligence-gathering priorities,‚Äù Fortinet said. ‚ÄúIts recent campaigns not only illustrate Confucius‚Äô persistence but also its ability to pivot rapidly between techniques, infrastructure, and malware families to maintain operational effectiveness.‚Äù
The disclosure comes as K7 Security Labs detailed an infection sequence associated with the
Patchwork
group
that commences with a malicious macro that‚Äôs designed to download a .LNK file containing PowerShell code responsible for downloading additional payloads and leveraging DLL side-loading to launch the primary malware while simultaneously displaying a decoy PDF document. The final payload, for its part, establishes contact with the threat actor‚Äôs command-and-control (C2) server, gathers system information, and retrieves an encoded instruction that‚Äôs subsequently decrypted for execution using cmd.exe. It‚Äôs also equipped to take screenshots, upload files from the machine, and download files from a remote URL and save them locally in a temporary directory.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe malware waits for a configurable period and retries sending the data up to 20 times, tracking failures to ensure persistent and stealthy data exfiltration without alerting the user or security systems,‚Äù the company

<h2 id="alert-malicious-pypi-package-soopsocks-infects-2653-systems-before-takedown"><a id="article-2"></a>Alert: Malicious PyPI Package soopsocks Infects 2,653 Systems Before Takedown</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have flagged a malicious package on the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository that claims to offer the ability to create a
SOCKS5
proxy service, while also providing a stealthy backdoor-like functionality to drop additional payloads on Windows systems. The deceptive package, named soopsocks, attracted a total of
2,653 downloads
before it was taken down. It was first
uploaded
by a user named ‚Äú
soodalpie
‚Äú on September 26, 2025, the same date the account was created. ‚ÄúWhile providing this capability, it exhibits behavior as a backdoor proxy server targeting Windows platforms, using automated installation processes via VBScript or an executable version,‚Äù JFrog
said
in an analysis.</p>

<p>The executable (‚Äú_AUTORUN.EXE‚Äù) is a compiled Go file that, besides including a SOCKS5 implementation as advertised, is also designed to run PowerShell scripts, set firewall rules, and relaunch itself with elevated permissions. It also carries out basic system and network reconnaissance, including Internet Explorer security settings and Windows installation date, and exfiltrates the information to a hard-coded Discord webhook. ‚Äú_AUTORUN.VBS,‚Äù the Visual Basic Script launched by the Python package in versions 0.2.5 and 0.2.6, is also capable of running a PowerShell script, which then downloads a ZIP file containing the legitimate Python binary from an external domain (‚Äúinstall.soop[.]space:6969‚Äù) and generates a batch script that‚Äôs configured to install the package using the ‚Äúpip install‚Äù command and run it. The PowerShell script then invokes the batch script, causing the Python package to be executed, which, in turn, elevates itself to run with administrative privileges (if not already), configure firewall rules to allow UDP and TCP communication via port 1080, install as a service, maintain communication with a Discord webhook, and set up persistence on the host using a scheduled task to make sure it automatically starts upon a system reboot.</p>

<p>‚Äúsoopsocks is a well-designed SOCKS5 proxy with full bootstrap Windows support,‚Äù JFrog said. ‚ÄúHowever, given the way it performs and actions it takes during runtime, it shows signs of malicious activity, such as firewall rules, elevated permissions, various PowerShell commands, and the transfer from simple, configurable Python scripts to a Go executable with hardcoded parameters, version with reconnaissance capabilities to a predetermined Discord webhook.‚Äù
The disclosure comes as npm package maintainers have raised concerns related to a lack of native 2FA workflows for CI/CD, self-hosted workflow support for trusted publishing, and token management following sweeping changes introduced by GitHub in response to a growing wave of software supply chain attacks, Socket
said
. Earlier this week, GitHub said it will shortly revoke all legacy tokens for npm publishers and that all granular access tokens for npm will have a default expiration of seven days (down from 30 days) and a maximum expiration of 90 days, which used to be unlimited previously. ‚ÄúLong-lived tokens are a primary vector for supply chain attacks.</p>

<p>When tokens are compromised, shorter lifetimes limit the window of exposure and reduce potential damage,‚Äù it
said
. ‚ÄúThis change brings npm in line with security best practices already adopted across the industry.‚Äù
It also comes as the software supply chain security firm released a free tool called Socket Firewall that blocks malicious packages at install time across npm, Python, and Rust ecosystems, giving developers the ability to safeguard their environments against potential threats. ‚ÄúSocket Firewall isn‚Äôt limited to protecting you from problematic top-level dependencies. It will also prevent the package manager from fetching any transitive dependency that is known to be malicious,‚Äù the company

<h2 id="automating-pentest-delivery-7-key-workflows-for-maximum-impact"><a id="article-3"></a>Automating Pentest Delivery: 7 Key Workflows for Maximum Impact</h2>

<p>Penetration testing is critical to uncovering real-world security weaknesses. With the shift into continuous testing and validation, it is time we automate the delivery of these results. The way results are delivered hasn‚Äôt kept up with today‚Äôs fast-moving threat landscape. Too often, findings are packaged into static reports, buried in PDFs or spreadsheets, and handed off manually to already-overloaded IT and engineering teams.</p>

<p>By the time remediation begins, days or even weeks may have passed since the issues were first discovered. As we explored in our recent article on
how automation is redefining pentest delivery
, static, manual processes no longer cut it. Security teams need faster insights, cleaner handoffs, and more consistent workflows if they want to keep pace with modern exposure management. That‚Äôs where automation makes the difference, ensuring findings move seamlessly from discovery to remediation in real time.</p>

<p>Where Should You Start? Knowing automation matters is only the first step. The bigger challenge is understanding where to start. Not every workflow carries equal impact, and trying to automate everything at once can be overwhelming.</p>

<p>This article focuses on the seven key workflows that deliver the greatest immediate value. By automating these first, security teams can accelerate delivery, reduce friction, and build the foundation for a modern, scalable approach to penetration test delivery. Platforms like
PlexTrac
help automate pentest finding delivery in real time through robust, rule-based workflows. (No waiting for the final report!)
1.</p>

<p>Create Tickets for Remediation When Findings Are Discovered
One of the most powerful ways to accelerate penetration test delivery is by integrating findings directly into the tools that engineering and IT teams already use. Instead of manually transcribing vulnerabilities into Jira, ServiceNow, or Azure DevOps, automation can create remediation tickets the moment findings are published. This ensures findings reach the right teams without delay, while eliminating the risk of human error during handoff. For organizations with multiple stakeholders ‚Äî from internal IT groups to external clients ‚Äî automated ticketing ensures everyone works within familiar systems, without adding new friction.</p>

<p>The result is faster remediation cycles, bidirectional visibility between teams, and ensuring all findings are tracked and resolved promptly. 2. Auto-Close Informational Findings
Not every discovery requires action. Informational findings, while valuable for historical context, can clutter dashboards and distract teams from higher-priority risks.</p>

<p>By automatically closing findings tagged as informational during scan ingestion, organizations can reduce triage noise and keep workflows streamlined. This automation helps security leaders ensure their teams stay focused on what truly matters, while still retaining visibility into lower-level data if needed. It‚Äôs a simple but effective way to declutter queues, improve dashboard accuracy, and give teams back valuable time. 3.</p>

<p>Send Real-Time Alerts for Critical Findings
Critical vulnerabilities discovered in active environments need immediate attention, often before a report is finalized. With automation, real-time alerts can be pushed directly to communication channels like Slack, Microsoft Teams, email, or even text using custom webhooks based on the severity of the finding. This workflow ensures high-severity issues are escalated instantly, enabling faster response and reducing risk exposure. In many cases, alerts can be paired with auto-ticket creation, sending findings to the right remediation team the moment they‚Äôre identified.</p>

<p>This proactive approach helps organizations shorten the time from discovery to mitigation. 4. Request Proofreading of Draft Findings
Delivering high-quality penetration tests requires collaboration and potentially multiple levels of review. Instead of sending manual messages asking teammates to review a draft or running into duplicate versioning issues, automation can trigger real-time notifications when findings are ready for proofreading.</p>

<p>This workflow promotes stronger peer review practices, reduces communication overhead, and helps teams scale their quality assurance process without slowing delivery. For junior analysts, it provides a structured way to involve more experienced team members in the editing process, ultimately improving the end deliverable. 5. Send Alerts When Findings Are Ready for Retest
Closing the loop on vulnerabilities is just as important as identifying them in the first place.</p>

<p>Retesting is often delayed because communication between testing and remediation teams breaks down. By automating alerts when findings are ready for retest, organizations ensure timely follow-up and avoid SLA misses. This workflow helps teams align more effectively, improves accountability, and reduces the risk of lingering vulnerabilities. It‚Äôs a small but high-impact automation that strengthens trust in the overall pentesting process by ensuring that vulnerabilities are truly resolved.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Auto-Assign Findings to Users Based on Role, Team, or Asset Type
Findings can quickly get lost in the shuffle if they‚Äôre not routed correctly. Manual assignment leads to delays, confusion, and even rework when issues land with the wrong team or individual. Automating assignment rules based on attributes like asset type, vulnerability category, or team role ensures findings are delivered directly to the subject matter experts best equipped to address them.</li>
</ol>

<p>This targeted delivery not only speeds up triage but also reduces human error and boosts overall efficiency. Whether findings need to go to a specific department, system owner, or regional team, auto-assignment builds clarity into the remediation process and ensures accountability from day one. 7. Send Finding Updates to Client Portals or Alert Clients Directly
For service providers, keeping clients informed during and after a pentest is critical for trust and satisfaction.</p>

<p>Instead of relying on periodic emails or manual updates, automation can send findings directly into client-facing portals or dashboards. Clients can also receive real-time alerts for critical issues, ensuring they have immediate visibility into high-severity risks. This creates a bridge between security providers and their clients, enabling faster responses and stronger collaboration so providers can position themselves as trusted partners. PlexTrac supports each of these capabilities through its Workflow Automation Engine.</p>

Workflow Automation Playbook
for deeper guidance on how these automations work together. Automation Amplifies the Impact of Penetration Testers
By eliminating repetitive tasks, reducing delays, and ensuring findings reach the right people at the right time, automation frees teams to focus on what matters most: protecting the organization. The seven workflows we‚Äôve outlined are not only practical starting points, but also building blocks for more advanced automation in the future. Whether it‚Äôs auto-assigning findings, streamlining retests, or delivering updates directly to stakeholders, each step helps create a more resilient, efficient, and collaborative security practice.</p>

Anthropic Touts Safety Protections Built Into Claude Sonnet 4.6
Anthropic said it has rolled out a number of safety and security improvements to Claude Sonnet 4.5, its latest coding focused model, that make it difficult for bad actors to exploit and secure the system against prompt injection attacks,
sycophancy
(i.e., the tendency of an AI to echo and validate user beliefs no matter how delusional or harmful they may be), 
      and child safety risks. ‚ÄúClaude‚Äôs improved capabilities and our extensive safety training have allowed us to substantially improve the model‚Äôs behavior, reducing concerning behaviors like sycophancy, deception, power-seeking, and the tendency to encourage delusional thinking,‚Äù 
      the company
said
. ‚ÄúFor the model‚Äôs agentic and computer use capabilities, we‚Äôve also made considerable progress on defending against prompt injection attacks, one of the most serious risks for users of these capabilities.‚Äù 
      The AI company said the latest model has better defensive cybersecurity abilities, such as vulnerability discovery, patching, and basic penetration testing capabilities.</p>

<p>However, it did acknowledge that these tools could be ‚Äúdual-use,‚Äù meaning they might also potentially be used by malicious actors, as well as cybersecurity professionals. Generative AI systems like those offered by Microsoft and OpenAI are at the forefront of a battle between companies providing sophisticated text and image generation capabilities and malicious actors looking to exploit them. Scan Waves Hint Pre-Exploit Staging
Exploit Attempts Target CVE-2024-3400
The SANS Internet Storm Center Security has disclosed its observation of a significant increase in internet-wide scans targeting the critical PAN-OS GlobalProtect vulnerability 
      (
CVE-2024-3400
). The vulnerability, disclosed last year, is a command injection vulnerability that could be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on susceptible firewalls.</p>

<p>SANS ISC said it has detected specially crafted requests that seek to upload a TXT file and subsequently attempt to retrieve that file via an HTTP GET request. ‚ÄúThis will return a ‚Äò403‚Äô error if the file exists, and a ‚Äò404‚Äô error if the upload failed. It will not execute code,‚Äù it
noted
. ‚ÄúThe content of the file is a standard Global Protect session file, and will not execute.</p>

<p>A follow-up attack would upload the file to a location that leads to code execution.‚Äù 
      In recent weeks, exploit attempts have also been registered against Hikvision cameras susceptible to an older flaw

Recommendations to Secure Against UNC6040
Google has outlined the various hardening recommendations that organizations can take to safeguard against attacks mounted by
UNC6040
, a financially motivated threat cluster that specializes in voice phishing (vishing) campaigns specifically designed to compromise organizations‚Äô Salesforce instances for large-scale data theft and subsequent extortion. Central to the operation involves deceiving victims into authorizing a malicious connected app to their organization‚Äôs Salesforce portal. ‚ÄúOver the past several months, UNC6040 has demonstrated repeated success in breaching networks by having its operators impersonate IT support personnel in convincing telephone-based social engineering engagements,‚Äù it
said
. ‚ÄúThis approach has proven particularly effective in tricking employees, often within English-speaking branches of multinational corporations, into actions that grant the attackers access or lead to the sharing of sensitive credentials, ultimately facilitating the theft of the organization‚Äôs Salesforce data.</p>

<p>In all observed cases, attackers relied on manipulating end users, not exploiting any vulnerability inherent to Salesforce.‚Äù
Phishers Use Robots.txt to Block Reporters
Dozens of Crypto Phishing Pages Flagged
Censys said it identified over 60 cryptocurrency phishing pages impersonating popular hardware wallet brands Trezor and Ledger through an analysis of robots.txt files. These sites have an entry in the file: ‚ÄúDisallow: /add_web_phish.php.‚Äù 
      ‚ÄúNotably, the actor behind the pages attempted to block popular phishing reporting sites from indexing the pages by including endpoints of the phishing reporting sites in their own robots.txt file,‚Äù the company said. The unusual robots.txt pattern has also been discovered on several GitHub repositories, some of which date back to January 2025. ‚ÄúThe misuse of robots.txt and the merge conflicts found in multiple READMEs could also suggest that the actor behind these pages is not well-versed in web development practices,‚Äù security researcher Emily Austin
added

<p>Drive Pauses Syncs ‚Äî Buys You Minutes
Google Drive Adds AI-Powered Smarts to Block Ransomware
Google has announced that it‚Äôs updating Google Drive for desktop with AI-powered ransomware detection to automatically stop file syncing and allow users to easily restore files with a few clicks. ‚ÄúOur AI-powered detection in Drive for desktop identifies the core signature of a ransomware attack ‚Äî an attempt to encrypt or corrupt files en masse ‚Äî and rapidly intervenes to put a protective bubble around a user‚Äôs files by stopping file syncing to the cloud before the ransomware can spread,‚Äù Google Cloud
said
. ‚ÄúThe detection engine adapts to novel ransomware by continuously analyzing file changes and incorporating new threat intelligence from VirusTotal. When Drive detects unusual activity that suggests a ransomware attack, it automatically pauses syncing of affected files, helping to prevent widespread data corruption across an organization‚Äôs Drive and the disruption of work.‚Äù 
      Users subsequently receive an alert on their desktop and via email, guiding them to restore their files.</p>

<p>The real-time ransomware detection capability is built atop a specialized AI model trained on millions of real victim files encrypted by various ransomware strains. Imgur Cuts U.K. Users, Investigation Still Open
Imgur Blocks Access to Service in the U.K. Imgur, a popular image hosting platform with more than 130 million users, has blocked access to users in the U.K.</p>

<p>after regulators signalled their intention to impose penalties over concerns around children‚Äôs data. The U.K.‚Äôs data watchdog, the Information Commissioner‚Äôs Office (ICO), said it recently notified the platform‚Äôs parent company, MediaLab AI, of plans to fine Imgur after investigating its approach to age checks and handling of children‚Äôs personal data. The probe was launched
earlier this March
. ‚ÄúImgur‚Äôs decision to restrict access in the U.K.</p>

<p>is a commercial decision taken by the company,‚Äù the ICO
said
. ‚ÄúWe have been clear that exiting the U.K. does not allow an organisation to avoid responsibility for any prior infringement of data protection law, and our investigation remains ongoing.‚Äù

<p>Demands Access ‚Äî Targets Britons‚Äô Backups
U.K. Government Issues New Order to Access iCloud User Data
The U.K. government has
issued
a new request for Apple to provide access to encrypted iCloud user data, this time focusing specifically on the ‚ÄåiCloud‚Äå data of British citizens, according to the Financial Times. The request, issued in early September 2025, has demanded that Apple create a way for officials to access encrypted ‚ÄåiCloud‚Äå backups.</p>

<p>In February, Apple
withdrew
‚ÄåiCloud‚Äå‚Äôs Advanced Data Protection feature in the U.K. Subsequent
pushback
from civil liberty groups and the U.S. government led to the U.K. apparently abandoning its plans to force Apple to weaken encryption protections and include a backdoor that would have enabled access to the protected data of U.S.</p>

<p>citizens. In late August, the Financial Times also
reported
that the U.K. government‚Äôs secret order was ‚Äúnot limited to‚Äù Apple‚Äôs ADP feature and included requirements for Apple to ‚Äúprovide and maintain a capability to disclose categories of data stored within a cloud-based backup service,‚Äù suggesting that the access was far broader in scope than previously known. Car Hacks Work Remotely ‚Äî Cars Still Unfixed
Apple CarPlay RCE Exploit Left Unpatched in Most Cars
Back in April 2025, Oligo Security disclosed a set of flaws in AirPlay called
AirBorne
(CVE-2025-24252 and CVE-2025-24132) that could be chained together to take over Apple CarPlay, in some cases, without even requiring any user interaction or authentication.</p>

<p>While the underlying technology uses the iAP2 protocol to establish a wireless connection over Bluetooth and negotiate a CarPlay Wi-Fi password to allow an iPhone to connect to the network and initiate screen mirroring, the researcher found that many devices and systems default to a ‚ÄúNo-PIN‚Äù approach during the Bluetooth pairing phase, making the attacks ‚Äúfrictionless and harder to detect.‚Äù 
      This, coupled with the fact that iAP2 does not authenticate the iPhone, meant that an attacker with a Bluetooth radio and a compatible iAP2 client can impersonate an iPhone, request the Wi-Fi credentials, trigger app launches, and issue any arbitrary iAP2 command. From there, attackers can exploit CVE-2025-24132 to achieve remote code execution with root privileges. ‚ÄúAlthough patches for CVE-2025-24132 were published on April 29, 2025, only a few select vendors actually patched,‚Äù Oligo
said
. ‚ÄúTo our knowledge, as of this post, no car manufacturer has applied the patch.‚Äù
New Rules: Companies Must Stop Hoarding Data
Russia Planning to Tighten Data Protection Laws
Russia‚Äôs Ministry of Digital Development is working on regulations to force companies to restrict the type of data they collect from citizens in the country, in the hopes of minimizing future leaks of confidential data.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSystems should not process information containing personal data beyond what is necessary to ensure business processes,‚Äù
said
Evgeny Khasin, acting director of the Ministry of Digital Development‚Äôs cybersecurity department. ‚ÄúThis is because many organizations tend to collect as much data as possible in order to interact with it in some way or use it for their own purposes, while the law stipulates that data should be minimized.‚Äù

<h2 id="google-mandiant-probes-new-oracle-extortion-wave-possibly-linked-to-cl0p-ransomware"><a id="article-6"></a>Google Mandiant Probes New Oracle Extortion Wave Possibly Linked to Cl0p Ransomware</h2>

<p>Google Mandiant and Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) have disclosed that they are tracking a new cluster of activity possibly linked to a financially motivated threat actor known as
Cl0p
. The malicious activity involves sending extortion emails to executives at various organizations and claiming to have stolen sensitive data from their Oracle E-Business Suite. ‚ÄúThis activity began on or before September 29, 2025, but Mandiant‚Äôs experts are still in the early stages of multiple investigations, and have not yet substantiated the claims made by this group,‚Äù Genevieve Stark, Head of Cybercrime and Information Operations Intelligence Analysis at GTIG, told The Hacker News in a statement. Mandiant CTO Charles Carmakal described the ongoing activity as a ‚Äúhigh-volume email campaign‚Äù that‚Äôs launched from hundreds of compromised accounts, with evidence suggesting that at least one of those accounts has been previously associated with activity from
FIN11
, which is a subset within the
TA505
group.</p>

<p>FIN11, per Mandiant, has engaged in ransomware and extortion attacks as far back as 2020. Previously, it was linked to the distribution of various malware families like FlawedAmmyy, FRIENDSPEAK, and MIXLABEL. ‚ÄúThe malicious emails contain contact information, and we‚Äôve verified that the two specific contact addresses provided are also publicly listed on the Cl0p data leak site (DLS),‚Äù Carmakal added. ‚ÄúThis move strongly suggests there‚Äôs some association with Cl0p, and they are leveraging the brand recognition for their current operation.‚Äù
That said, Google said it does not have any evidence on its own to confirm the alleged ties, despite similarities in tactics observed in past Cl0p attacks.</p>

<p>The company is also urging organizations to investigate their environments for evidence of threat actor activity. It‚Äôs currently not clear how initial access is obtained. However, according to
Bloomberg
, it‚Äôs believed that the attackers compromised user emails and abused the default password reset function to gain valid credentials of internet-facing Oracle E-Business Suite portals, citing information shared by Halycon. The Hacker News has reached out to Oracle for further comment about the extortion campaign, and will update the story if we hear back.</p>

<p>In recent years, the highly prolific Cl0p group has been
attributed
to a number of attack waves exploiting zero-day flaws in Accellion FTA, SolarWinds Serv-U FTP, Fortra GoAnywhere MFT, and Progress MOVEit Transfer platforms, successfully breaching thousands of organizations. Found this article interesting? Follow us on

<h2 id="download-report-state-of-ai-in-the-soc-2025-what-280-security-leaders-say"><a id="article-7"></a>[Download Report] State of AI in the SOC 2025: What 280+ Security Leaders Say</h2>

<h2 id="how-to-close-threat-detection-gaps-your-socs-action-plan"><a id="article-8"></a>How to Close Threat Detection Gaps: Your SOC‚Äôs Action Plan</h2>

<p>Running a SOC often feels like drowning in alerts. Every morning, dashboards light up with thousands of signals; some urgent, many irrelevant. The job is to find the real threats fast enough to keep cases from piling up, prevent analyst burnout, and maintain client or leadership confidence. The toughest challenges, however, aren‚Äôt the alerts that can be dismissed quickly, but the ones that hide in plain sight.</p>

<p>These tricky threats drag out investigations, create unnecessary escalations, and quietly drain resources over time. Why Detection Gaps Keep Opening
What slows SOCs down isn‚Äôt the flood of alerts alone but the way investigations get split across disconnected tools. Intel in one platform, detonation in another, enrichment in a third; every switch wastes time. Across hundreds of cases, those minutes add up to stalled investigations, unnecessary escalations, and threats that linger longer than they should.</p>

<p>Action Plan That Delivers 3√ó SOC Efficiency in Threat Detection
SOC teams looking to close detection gaps have found one approach that works: building detection as a continuous workflow, where every step reinforces the next. Instead of stalling in disconnected tools, analysts move through a process that flows, from filtering alerts to detonating suspicious files to validating indicators. A recent
ANY.RUN
survey shows just how much this shift can change SOC performance:
95% of SOC teams
reported faster investigations
94% of users
said triage became quicker and clearer
21 minutes saved
on MTTR for each case
Up to 58% more threats identified overall
3-step action plan with its impact when using ANY.RUN
Behind these numbers is more than speed. SOCs that adopted this workflow reduced alert overload, gained clearer visibility into complex attacks, and built confidence in compliance and reporting.</p>

<p>Teams also grew faster in expertise, as analysts learned by doing rather than relying solely on static reports. So how are these numbers possible? The answer lies in three practical steps SOC teams have already put into action. Let‚Äôs look at how this plan works, and how you can implement it in your own workflows.</p>

<p>Step 1: Expand Threat Coverage Early
The earlier a SOC can spot an incident, the faster it can respond. Threat Intelligence Feeds
give analysts fresh, actionable IOCs drawn from the latest malware campaigns; IPs, domains, and hashes seen in real-world attacks. Instead of chasing alerts blindly, teams start with data that reflects what‚Äôs happening across the threat landscape right now. TI Feeds as your first step in threat detection
With this early coverage, SOCs gain three key advantages: they catch incidents sooner, stay aligned with current threats, and cut down on noise that clutters Tier 1.</p>

<p>In practice, that means a
20% decrease in Tier 1 workload
and fewer escalations eating into senior analysts‚Äô time. Don‚Äôt let detection gaps slow your team down. Start with the 3-level process today and give your SOC the clarity and speed it needs. Try ANY.RUN now
The best part is that Threat Intelligence Feeds are available in multiple formats with simple integration options, so they can plug directly into your existing SIEM, TIP, or SOAR setup without disrupting workflows.</p>

<p>By filtering out duplicates and irrelevant signals at the start, Threat Feeds free up resources and ensure analysts focus on the alerts that actually matter. Step 2: Streamline Triage &amp; Response with Interactive Sandbox
Once alerts are filtered, the next challenge is proving what‚Äôs left. An
interactive sandbox
becomes the SOC‚Äôs proving ground. Instead of waiting for static reports, analysts can detonate suspicious files and URLs in real time, watching behavior unfold step by step.</p>

<p>This approach exposes what most automated defenses miss; payloads that need clicks to activate, staged downloads that appear over time, and evasive tactics designed to fool passive detection. ANY.RUN‚Äôs sandbox analyzing complex threat
The result is faster, clearer answers:
Evasive attacks exposed
before they can escalate
Actionable threat reports
generated for quick response
Routine tasks minimized
with automated investigations
In practice, SOCs achieve a
15-second median detection time
, turning what used to be long, uncertain investigations into rapid, decisive outcomes. By combining real-time visibility with automation, the sandbox gives specialists of all levels the confidence to act quickly, while freeing senior staff from spending hours on routine triage. Step 3: Strengthen Proactive Defense with Threat Intelligence Lookup
Even with full sandbox results, one question always remains:
has this threat been seen before?</p>

<p>Knowing whether an IOC is part of a fresh campaign or one already circulating across industries can completely change how a SOC responds. That‚Äôs why the third step is implementing
Threat Intelligence Lookup
. By tapping into live attack data contributed by more than
15,000 SOCs worldwide
, analysts instantly enrich their findings and connect isolated alerts to wider patterns. TI Lookup search of attack and its relevant sandbox analyses
The advantages are clear:
Hidden threats uncovered
through proactive hunting
Greater incident clarity
with rich historical context
Real-time visibility
into evolving campaigns
With access to
24√ó more IOCs
than typical isolated sources, security professionals can validate faster, close tickets sooner, and anticipate what might be coming next.</p>

<p>This final step ensures that every investigation ends with stronger evidence; not just a snapshot of one case, but an understanding of how it fits into the bigger threat landscape. Build a Stronger SOC With a Unified Detection Workflow
Closing detection gaps is possible by creating a workflow where every stage strengthens the next. With early filtering from Threat Feeds, real-time visibility from the sandbox, and global context from Lookup, SOCs move from fragmented detection to a continuous process that delivers measurable results: faster triage, fewer escalations, and up to
3√ó greater efficiency
in threat detection. Organizations worldwide are already seeing the benefits:
74% of Fortune 100 companies
use ANY.RUN to reinforce SOC operations
15,000+ organizations
have integrated it into their detection workflows
500,000+ users
rely on it daily for malware analysis and threat intelligence
Boost your detection rate, cut investigation time, and strengthen SOC efficiency.</p>

<h2 id="warning-beware-of-android-spyware-disguised-as-signal-encryption-plugin-and-totok-pro"><a id="article-9"></a>Warning: Beware of Android Spyware Disguised as Signal Encryption Plugin and ToTok Pro</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have discovered two Android spyware campaigns dubbed
ProSpy
and
ToSpy
that impersonate apps like Signal and ToTok to target users in the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.). Slovak cybersecurity company ESET said the malicious apps are distributed via fake websites and social engineering to trick unsuspecting users into downloading them. Once installed, both the spyware malware strains establish persistent access to compromised Android devices and exfiltrate data. ‚ÄúNeither app containing the spyware was available in official app stores; both required manual installation from third-party websites posing as legitimate services,‚Äù ESET researcher Luk√°≈° ≈†tefanko
said
.</p>

<p>Notably, one of the websites distributing the ToSpy malware family mimicked the Samsung Galaxy Store, luring users into manually downloading and installing a malicious version of the ToTok app.‚Äù
The ProSpy campaign, discovered in June 2025, is believed to have been ongoing since 2024, leveraging deceptive websites masquerading as Signal and ToTok to host booby-trapped APK files that claim to be upgrades to the respective apps, namely Signal Encryption Plugin and ToTok Pro. The use of ToTok as a lure is no coincidence, as the app was
removed
from Google Play and Apple App Store in December 2019 due to
concerns
that it acted as a spying tool for the U.A.E. government, harvesting users‚Äô conversations, locations, and other data. The developers of ToTok
subsequently
went on to
claim
the removal was an ‚Äúattack perpetrated against our company by those who hold a dominant position in this market‚Äù and that the app does not spy on users.</p>

<p>The rogue ProSpy apps are designed to request permissions to access contacts, SMS messages, and files stored on the device. It‚Äôs also capable of exfiltrating device information. ESET said its telemetry also flagged another Android spyware family actively distributed in the wild and targeting users in the same region around the same time ProSpy was detected. The ToSpy campaign, which likely began on June 30, 2022, and is currently ongoing, has leveraged fake sites impersonating the ToTok app to deliver the malware.</p>

<p>The regionally focused campaigns center around stealing sensitive data files, media, contacts, and chat backups, with the ToTok Pro app propagated in the ProSpy cluster featuring a ‚ÄúCONTINUE‚Äù button that, when tapped, redirects the user to the official download page in the web browser and instructs them to download the actual app. ‚ÄúThis redirection is designed to reinforce the illusion of legitimacy,‚Äù ESET said. ‚ÄúAny future launches of the malicious ToTok Pro app will instead open the real ToTok app, effectively masking the spyware‚Äôs presence. However, the user will still see two apps installed on the device (ToTok and ToTok Pro), which could be suspicious.‚Äù
The Signal Encryption Plugin, in a similar manner, includes an ‚ÄúENABLE‚Äù button to deceive the users into downloading the legitimate encrypted messaging app by visiting the signal[.]org site.</p>

<p>But unlike the case of ToTok Pro, the rogue Signal app icon is changed to impersonate Google Play Services once the victim grants it all the necessary permissions. Regardless of the app installed, the spyware embedded within it stealthily exfiltrates the data before the user clicks CONTINUE or ENABLE. This includes device information, SMS messages, contact lists, files, and a list of installed applications. ‚ÄúSimilarly to ProSpy, ToSpy also includes steps designed to further deceive the victim into believing that the malware they just installed is a legitimate app,‚Äù ≈†tefanko said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAfter the user launches the malicious ToTok app, there are two possible scenarios: either the official ToTok app is installed on the device or it‚Äôs not.‚Äù
‚ÄúIf the official ToTok app is not installed on the device, ToSpy attempts to redirect the user to the Huawei AppGallery, either through an already installed Huawei app or via the default browser, suggesting the user download the official ToTok app.‚Äù
In the event the app is already installed on the device, it displays a fake screen to give the impression that it‚Äôs checking for app updates before seamlessly launching the official ToTok app. However, in the background, it collects user contacts, files matching certain extensions, device information, and ToTok data backups (*.ttkmbackup). To achieve persistence, both the spyware families run a foreground service that displays a persistent notification, use Android‚Äôs AlarmManager to repeatedly restart the foreground service if it gets terminated, and automatically launch the necessary background services upon a device reboot. ESET said the campaigns are being tracked differently due to differences in delivery methods and infrastructure, despite several commonalities in the malware deployed.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs currently not known who is behind the activity. ‚ÄúUsers should remain vigilant when downloading apps from unofficial sources and avoid enabling installation from unknown origins, as well as when installing apps or add-ons outside of official app stores, especially those claiming to enhance trusted services,‚Äù the company added.

<h2 id="new-wiretap-attack-extracts-intel-sgx-ecdsa-key-via-ddr4-memory-bus-interposer"><a id="article-10"></a>New WireTap Attack Extracts Intel SGX ECDSA Key via DDR4 Memory-Bus Interposer</h2>

<p>In yet another piece of research, academics from Georgia Institute of Technology and Purdue University have demonstrated that the security guarantees offered by Intel‚Äôs Software Guard eXtensions (SGX) can be bypassed on DDR4 systems to passively decrypt sensitive data. SGX is
designed
as a hardware feature in Intel server processors that allows applications to be run in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). It essentially isolates trusted code and resources within what‚Äôs called enclaves, preventing attackers from viewing their memory or CPU state. In doing so, the mechanism ensures that the data stays confidential even when the underlying operating system has been tampered with or compromised by other means.</p>

<p>However, the latest findings show the limitations of SGX. ‚ÄúWe show how one can build a device to physically inspect all memory traffic inside a computer cheaply and easily, in environments with only basic electrical tools, and using equipment easily purchased on the internet,‚Äù the researchers
said
. ‚ÄúUsing our interposer device against SGX‚Äôs attestation mechanism, we are able to extract an SGX secret attestation key from a machine in fully trusted status, thereby breaching SGX‚Äôs security.‚Äù
Like the
Battering RAM attack
recently disclosed by KU Leuven and the University of Birmingham researchers, the newly devised method ‚Äì codenamed WireTap ‚Äì relies on an interposer that sits between the CPU and the memory module to observe the data that flows between them. The interposer can be installed by a threat actor either through a supply chain attack or physical compromise.</p>

<p>At its core, the physical attack exploits Intel‚Äôs use of
deterministic encryption
to stage a full key recovery against Intel SGX‚Äôs Quoting Enclave (QE), effectively making it possible to extract an ECDSA signing key that can be used to sign arbitrary SGX enclave reports. Put differently, an attacker can weaponize the deterministic nature of memory encryption to build an oracle of sorts to break the security of constant-time cryptographic code. ‚ÄúWe have successfully extracted attestation keys, which are the primary mechanism used to determine whether code is running under SGX,‚Äù the researchers said. ‚ÄúThis allows any hacker to masquerade as genuine SGX hardware, while in fact running code in an exposed manner and peeking into your data.‚Äù
‚ÄúLike two sides of the same coin, WireTap and Battering RAM look at complementary properties of deterministic encryption.</p>

<p>While WireTap focuses mainly on breaching confidentiality, BatteringRAM focuses mostly on integrity. The bottom line is the same; however, both SGX and SEV are easy to break using memory interposition.‚Äù
However, while Battering RAM is a low-cost attack that can be pulled off using equipment costing less than $50, the WireTap setup costs about $1,000, including the logic analyzer. In a hypothetical attack scenario targeting SGX-backed blockchain deployments such as Phala Network, Secret Network, Crust Network, and IntegriTEE, the study found that WireTap can be leveraged to undermine confidentiality and integrity guarantees and allow attackers to disclose confidential transactions or illegitimately obtain transaction rewards. In response to the findings, Intel said the exploit is outside the scope of its threat model since it assumes a physical adversary that has direct access to the hardware with a memory bus interposer.</p>

<p>In the absence of a ‚Äúpatch,‚Äù it‚Äôs recommended that the servers be run in secure physical environments and use cloud providers that provide independent physical security. ‚ÄúSuch attacks are outside the scope of the boundary of protection offered by Advanced Encryption Standard-XEX-based Tweaked Codebook Mode with Ciphertext Stealing (AES-XTS) based memory encryption,‚Äù the chipmaker
said
. ‚ÄúAs it provides limited confidentiality protection, and no integrity or anti-replay protection against attackers with physical capabilities, Intel does not plan to issue a CVE.‚Äù

<h2 id="onelogin-bug-let-attackers-use-api-keys-to-steal-oidc-secrets-and-impersonate-apps"><a id="article-11"></a>OneLogin Bug Let Attackers Use API Keys to Steal OIDC Secrets and Impersonate Apps</h2>

<p>A high-severity security flaw has been disclosed in the One Identity OneLogin Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution that, if successfully exploited, could expose sensitive OpenID Connect (
OIDC
) application client secrets under certain circumstances. The vulnerability, tracked as
CVE-2025-59363
, has been assigned a CVSS score of 7.7 out of 10.0. It has been described as a case of incorrect resource transfer between spheres (
CWE-669
), which causes a program to cross security boundaries and obtain unauthorized access to confidential data or functions. CVE-2025-59363 ‚Äúallowed attackers with valid API credentials to enumerate and retrieve client secrets for all OIDC applications within an organization‚Äôs OneLogin tenant,‚Äù Clutch Security
said
in a report shared with The Hacker News.</p>

<p>The identity security said the problem stems from the fact that the application listing endpoint ‚Äì
/api/2/apps
‚Äì was configured to return more data than expected, including the client_secret values in the API response alongside metadata related to the apps in a OneLogin account. The steps to pull off the attack are listed below -
Attacker uses valid OneLogin API credentials (client ID and secret) to authenticate
Request access token
Call the /api/2/apps endpoint to list all applications
Parse the response to retrieve client secrets for all OIDC applications
Use extracted client secrets to impersonate applications and access integrated services
Successful exploitation of the flaw could allow an attacker with valid OneLogin API credentials to retrieve client secrets for all OIDC applications configured within a OneLogin tenant. Armed with this access, the threat actor could leverage the exposed secret to impersonate users and gain access to other applications, offering opportunities for lateral movement. OneLogin‚Äôs role-based access control (RBAC) grants API keys broad endpoint access, meaning the compromised credentials could be used to access sensitive endpoints across the entire platform.</p>

<p>Compounding matters further is the lack of IP address allowlisting, as a result of which it‚Äôs possible for attackers to exploit the flaw from anywhere in the world, Clutch noted. Following responsible disclosure on July 18, 2025, the vulnerability was addressed in

<h2 id="learn-how-leading-security-teams-blend-ai--human-workflows-free-webinar"><a id="article-12"></a>Learn How Leading Security Teams Blend AI + Human Workflows (Free Webinar)</h2>

<p>AI is changing automation‚Äîbut not always for the better. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre hosting a new webinar, ‚Äú
Workflow Clarity: Where AI Fits in Modern Automation
,‚Äù with Thomas Kinsella, Co-founder &amp; Chief Customer Officer at Tines, to explore how leading teams are cutting through the hype and building workflows that actually deliver. The rise of AI has changed how organizations think about automation. But here‚Äôs the reality many teams are quietly wrestling with:
AI isn‚Äôt a silver bullet.</p>

<p>Purely human-led workflows buckle under pressure, rigid rules-based automations break the moment reality shifts, and fully autonomous AI agents risk introducing black-box decision-making that‚Äôs impossible to audit. For cybersecurity and operations leaders, the stakes are even higher. You need workflows that are fast but reliable, powerful but secure, and‚Äîabove all‚Äîexplainable. So where does AI
really
fit in?</p>

<p>The Hidden Problem with ‚ÄúAll-In‚Äù Automation
The push to automate everything has left many teams with fragile systems:
Too much human intervention:
slows down response time and eats up valuable analyst hours. Too many rigid rules:
can‚Äôt adapt to new threats or business realities, leading to constant rework. Too much AI:
risks shadow processes that no one fully understands, undermining trust and compliance. The truth?</p>

<p>The strongest workflows aren‚Äôt found at the extremes‚Äîthey emerge when human judgment, traditional automation, and AI are blended
intentionally. A Webinar for Teams Who Want More Than AI Hype
Join Thomas Kinsella for a candid look at how top security and operations teams are blending people, rules, and AI agents to build workflows that deliver real outcomes‚Äîwithout over-engineering or sacrificing control. In this session, you‚Äôll learn:
Where AI belongs (and where it doesn‚Äôt):
practical guidance on mapping human, rules-based, and AI-driven tasks. How to avoid AI overreach:
spotting when automation is adding complexity instead of clarity.</p>

<p>Building for security and auditability:
ensuring workflows stand up to compliance and scrutiny. Proven patterns from the field:
real-world examples of how top security teams are scaling AI automation thoughtfully. This session is designed for security leaders who are tired of the AI hype and want to cut through the noise. If you‚Äôre looking for practical strategies to deploy automation that strengthens defenses‚Äîwithout creating new risks‚Äîthis is for you.</p>

<p>Watch this Webinar Now
It‚Äôs equally valuable for Ops and IT teams working to free up their human talent while avoiding brittle, opaque systems that collapse under real-world pressure. And if you‚Äôre an innovation-minded professional exploring how to balance people, rules, and AI agents in the workplace, you‚Äôll walk away with a clear framework for making those choices. AI is already transforming workflows, but the winners won‚Äôt be those who chase complexity‚Äîthey‚Äôll be the teams who embrace clarity, security, and control. This webinar will give you the tools to identify the right mix of human, rules-based, and AI automation for your environment, and show you how to implement it in ways that are secure, auditable, and built to scale with confidence.</p>

<h2 id="red-hat-openshift-ai-flaw-exposes-hybrid-cloud-infrastructure-to-full-takeover"><a id="article-13"></a>Red Hat OpenShift AI Flaw Exposes Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure to Full Takeover</h2>

<p>A severe security flaw has been disclosed in the Red Hat OpenShift AI service that could allow attackers to escalate privileges and take control of the complete infrastructure under certain conditions. OpenShift AI
is a platform for managing the lifecycle of predictive and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models at scale and across hybrid cloud environments. It also facilitates data acquisition and preparation, model training and fine-tuning, model serving and model monitoring, and hardware acceleration. The vulnerability, tracked as
CVE-2025-10725
, carries a CVSS score of 9.9 out of a maximum of 10.0.</p>

<p>It has been classified by Red Hat as ‚ÄúImportant‚Äù and not ‚ÄúCritical‚Äù in severity owing to the need for a remote attacker to be authenticated in order to compromise the environment. ‚ÄúA low-privileged attacker with access to an authenticated account, for example, as a data scientist using a standard Jupyter notebook, can escalate their privileges to a full cluster administrator,‚Äù Red Hat
said
in an advisory earlier this week. ‚ÄúThis allows for the complete compromise of the cluster‚Äôs confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The attacker can steal sensitive data, disrupt all services, and take control of the underlying infrastructure, leading to a total breach of the platform and all applications hosted on it.‚Äù
The following versions are affected by the flaw -
Red Hat OpenShift AI 2.19
Red Hat OpenShift AI 2.21
Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI)
As mitigations, Red Hat is recommending that users avoid granting broad permissions to system-level groups, and ‚Äúthe ClusterRoleBinding that associates the kueue-batch-user-role with the system:authenticated group.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe permission to create jobs should be granted on a more granular, as-needed basis to specific users or groups, adhering to the principle of least privilege,‚Äù it added.</p>

<h2 id="hackers-exploit-milesight-routers-to-send-phishing-sms-to-european-users"><a id="article-14"></a>Hackers Exploit Milesight Routers to Send Phishing SMS to European Users</h2>

<p>Unknown threat actors are abusing Milesight industrial cellular routers to send SMS messages as part of a smishing campaign targeting users in European countries since at least February 2022. French cybersecurity company SEKOIA said the attackers are exploiting the cellular router‚Äôs API to send malicious SMS messages containing phishing URLs, with the campaigns primarily targeting Sweden, Italy, and Belgium using typosquatted URLs that impersonate government platforms like CSAM and eBox, as well as banking, postal, and telecom providers. Of the 18,000 routers of this type accessible on the public internet, no less than 572 are assessed to be potentially vulnerable due to them exposing the inbox/outbox APIs. About half of the identified vulnerable routers are located in Europe.</p>

<p>‚ÄúMoreover, the API enables retrieval of both incoming and outgoing SMS messages, which indicates that the vulnerability has been actively exploited to disseminate malicious SMS campaigns since at least February 2022,‚Äù the company
said
. ‚ÄúThere is no evidence of any attempt to install backdoors or exploit other vulnerabilities on the device. This suggests a targeted approach, aligned specifically with the attacker‚Äôs smishing operations.‚Äù
It‚Äôs believed the attackers are exploiting a now-patched information disclosure flaw impacting Milesight routers (CVE-2023-43261, CVSS score: 7.5), which was
disclosed
by security researcher Bipin Jitiya exactly two years ago. Weeks later, VulnCheck
revealed
that the vulnerability may have been weaponized in the wild shortly following public disclosure.</p>

<p>Further investigation has revealed that some of the industrial routers expose SMS-related features, including sending messages or viewing SMS history, without requiring any form of authentication. The attacks likely involve an initial validation phase where the threat actors attempt to verify whether a given router can send SMS messages by targeting a phone number under their control. SEKOIA further noted that the API could also be publicly accessible due to misconfigurations, given that a couple of routers have been found running more recent firmware versions that are not susceptible to CVE-2023-43261. The phishing URLs distributed using this method include JavaScript that checks whether the page is being accessed from a mobile device before serving the malicious content, which, in turn, urges users to update their banking information for purported reimbursement.</p>

<p>What‚Äôs more, one of the domains used in the campaigns between January and April 2025 ‚Äì jnsi[.]xyz ‚Äì feature JavaScript code to disable right-click actions and browser debugging tools in an attempt to hinder analysis efforts. Some of the pages have also been found to log visitor connections to a Telegram bot named GroozaBot, which is operated by an actor named ‚ÄúGro_oza,‚Äù who appears to speak both Arabic and French. ‚ÄúThe smishing campaigns appear to have been conducted through the exploitation of vulnerable cellular routers ‚Äì a relatively unsophisticated, yet effective, delivery vector,‚Äù SEKOIA said. ‚ÄúThese devices are particularly appealing to threat actors as they enable decentralised SMS distribution across multiple countries, complicating both detection and takedown efforts.‚Äù
