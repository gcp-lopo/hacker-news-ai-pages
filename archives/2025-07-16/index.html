<h2 id="unc6148-backdoors-fully-patched-sonicwall-sma-100-series-devices-with-overstep-rootkit"><a id="article-1"></a>UNC6148 Backdoors Fully-Patched SonicWall SMA 100 Series Devices with OVERSTEP Rootkit</h2>

<p>A threat activity cluster has been observed targeting fully-patched
end-of-life
SonicWall Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 100 series appliances as part of a campaign designed to drop a backdoor called
OVERSTEP
. The malicious activity, dating back to at least October 2024, has been
attributed
by the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) to a group it tracks as
UNC6148
. The tech giant assessed with high confidence that the threat actor is ‚Äúleveraging credentials and one-time password (OTP) seeds stolen during previous intrusions, allowing them to regain access even after organizations have applied security updates.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnalysis of network traffic metadata records suggests that UNC6148 may have initially exfiltrated these credentials from the SMA appliance as early as January 2025.‚Äù
The exact initial access vector used to deliver the malware is currently not known due to the steps taken by the threat actors to remove log entries. But it‚Äôs believed that access may have been gained through the exploitation of known security flaws such as
CVE-2021-20035
,
CVE-2021-20038, CVE-2021-20039
,
CVE-2024-38475
, or
CVE-2025-32819
.</p>

<p>Alternately, the tech giant‚Äôs threat intelligence team theorized that the administrator credentials could‚Äôve been obtained through information-stealing logs or acquired from credential marketplaces. However, it said it didn‚Äôt find any evidence to back up this hypothesis. Upon gaining access, the threat actors have been found to establish an SSL-VPN session and spawn a reverse shell, although how this was achieved remains a mystery given that shell access should not be possible by design on these appliances. It‚Äôs believed that it may have been pulled off by means of a zero-day flaw.</p>

<p>The reverse shell is used to run reconnaissance and file manipulation commands, not to mention export and import settings to the SMA appliance, suggesting that UNC6148 may have altered an exported settings file offline to include new rules so that their operations are not interrupted or blocked by the access gateways. The attacks culminate in the deployment of a previously undocumented implant named OVERSTEP that‚Äôs capable of modifying the appliance‚Äôs boot process to maintain persistent access, as well as credential theft and concealing its own components to evade detection by patching various file system-related functions. This is achieved by implementing a usermode rootkit through the hijacked standard library functions open and readdir, allowing it to hide the artifacts associated with the attack. The malware also hooks into the write API function to receive commands from an attacker-controlled server in the form of embedded within web requests -
dobackshell
, which starts a reverse shell to the specified IP address and port
dopasswords
, which creates a TAR archive of the files /tmp/temp.db, /etc/EasyAccess/var/conf/persist.db, and /etc/EasyAccess/var/cert, and save it in the location ‚Äú/usr/src/EasyAccess/www/htdocs/‚Äù so that it can be downloaded via a web browser
‚ÄúUNC6148 modified the legitimate RC file ‚Äò/etc/rc.d/rc.fwboot‚Äô to achieve persistence for OVERSTEP,‚Äù GTIG said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe changes meant that whenever the appliance was rebooted, the OVERSTEP binary would be loaded into the running file system on the appliance.‚Äù
Once the deployment step is complete, the threat actor then proceeds to clear the system logs and reboots the firewall to activate the execution of the C-based backdoor. The malware also attempts to remove the command execution traces from different log files, including httpd.log, http_request.log, and inotify.log. ‚ÄúThe actor‚Äôs success in hiding their tracks is largely due to OVERSTEP‚Äôs capability to selectively delete log entries [from the three log files],‚Äù Google said. ‚ÄúThis anti-forensic measure, combined with a lack of shell history on disk, significantly reduces visibility into the actor‚Äôs secondary objectives.‚Äù
Google has evaluated with medium confidence that UNC6148 may have weaponized an unknown, zero-day remote code execution vulnerability to deploy OVERSTEP on targeted SonicWall SMA appliances.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it‚Äôs suspected that the operations are carried out with the intent to facilitate data theft and extortion operations, and even ransomware deployment. This connection stems from the fact that one of the organizations that was targeted by UNC6148 was posted on the data leak site operated by World Leaks, an extortion gang run by individuals previously associated with the Hunters International ransomware scheme. It‚Äôs worth noting that Hunters International recently
shuttered
its criminal enterprise. According to Google, UNC6148 exhibits tactical overlaps with prior exploitation of SonicWall SMA devices observed in July 2023 that involved an unknown threat actor deploying a web shell, a hiding mechanism, and a way to ensure persistence across firmware upgrades, per
Truesec
.</p>

<p>The exploitation activity was subsequently
linked
by security researcher Stephan Berger to the deployment of the Abyss ransomware. The findings once again highlight how threat actors are increasingly focusing on edge network systems that aren‚Äôt usually covered by common security tools like Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) or antivirus software and slip into target networks unnoticed. ‚ÄúOrganizations should acquire disk images for forensic analysis to avoid interference from the rootkit anti-forensic capabilities. Organizations may need to engage with SonicWall to capture disk images from physical appliances,‚Äù Google said.</p>

<h2 id="critical-golden-dmsa-attack-in-windows-server-2025-enables-cross-domain-attacks-and-persistent-access"><a id="article-2"></a>Critical Golden dMSA Attack in Windows Server 2025 Enables Cross-Domain Attacks and Persistent Access</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed what they say is a ‚Äúcritical design flaw‚Äù in delegated Managed Service Accounts (dMSAs) introduced in Windows Server 2025. ‚ÄúThe flaw can result in high-impact attacks, enabling cross-domain lateral movement and persistent access to all managed service accounts and their resources across Active Directory indefinitely,‚Äù Semperis said in a report shared with The Hacker News. Put differently, successful exploitation could allow adversaries to sidestep authentication guardrails and generate passwords for all Delegated Managed Service Accounts (
dMSAs
) and group Managed Service Accounts (
gMSAs
) and their associated service accounts. The persistence and privilege escalation method has been codenamed
Golden dMSA
, with the cybersecurity company deeming it as low complexity owing to the fact that the vulnerability simplifies brute-force password generation.</p>

<p>However, in order for bad actors to exploit it, they must already be in possession of a Key Distribution Service (KDS)
root key
that‚Äôs typically only available to privileged accounts, such as root Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins, and SYSTEM. Described as the crown jewel of Microsoft‚Äôs gMSA infrastructure, the KDS root key serves as a master key, allowing an attacker to derive the current password for any dMSA or gMSA account without having to connect to the domain controller. ‚ÄúThe attack leverages a critical design flaw: A structure that‚Äôs used for the password-generation computation contains predictable time-based components with only 1,024 possible combinations, making brute-force password generation computationally trivial,‚Äù security researcher Adi Malyanker
said
. Delegated Managed Service Accounts is a new feature
introduced
by Microsoft that facilitates migration from an existing legacy service account.</p>

<p>It was introduced in Windows Server 2025 as a way to counter Kerberoasting attacks. The machine accounts bind authentication directly to explicitly authorized machines in Active Directory (AD), thus eliminating the possibility of credential theft. By tying authentication to device identity, only specified machine identities mapped in AD can access the account. Golden dMSA, similar to
Golden gMSA
Active Directory
attacks
, plays out over four steps once an attacker has obtained elevated privileges within a domain -
Extracting KDS root key material by elevating to SYSTEM privileges on one of the domain controllers
Enumerating dMSA accounts using
LsaOpenPolicy
and
LsaLookupSids
APIs or via a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (
LDAP
)-based approach
Identifying the
ManagedPasswordID
attribute and password hashes through targeted guessing
Generating valid passwords (i.e., Kerberos tickets) for any gMSA or dMSA associated with the compromised key and testing them via
Pass the Hash
or
Overpass the Hash
techniques
‚ÄúThis process requires no additional privileged access once the KDS root key is obtained, making it a particularly dangerous persistence method,‚Äù Malyanker said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe attack highlights the critical trust boundary of managed service accounts. They rely on domain-level cryptographic keys for security. Although automatic password rotation provides excellent protection against typical credential attacks, Domain Admins, DnsAdmins, and Print Operators can bypass these protections entirely and compromise all of the dMSAs and gMSAs in the forest.‚Äù
Semperis noted that the Golden dMSA technique turns the breach into a forest-wide persistent backdoor, given that compromising the KDS root key from any single domain within the forest is enough to breach every dMSA account across all domains in that forest. In other words, a single KDS root key extraction can be weaponized to achieve cross-domain account compromise, forest-wide credential harvesting, and lateral movement across domains using the compromised dMSA accounts.</p>

<p>‚ÄúEven in environments with multiple KDS root keys, the system consistently uses the first (oldest) KDS root key for compatibility reasons,‚Äù Malyanker pointed out. ‚ÄúThis means that the original key we‚Äôve compromised could be preserved by Microsoft‚Äôs design ‚Äì creating a persistent backdoor that could last for years.‚Äù
Even more concerning is that the attack completely sidesteps normal
Credential Guard
protections, which are used to secure NTLM password hashes, Kerberos Ticket Granting Tickets (TGTs), and credentials so that only privileged system software can access them. Following responsible disclosure on May 27, 2025, Microsoft said, ‚ÄúIf you have the secrets used to derive the key, you can authenticate as that user. These features have never been intended to protect against a compromise of a domain controller.‚Äù Semperis has also
released
an open-source as proof-of-concept (PoC) to demonstrate the attack.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat starts as one DC compromise escalates to owning every dMSA-protected service across an entire enterprise forest,‚Äù Malyanker said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just privilege escalation. It‚Äôs enterprise-wide digital domination through a single cryptographic vulnerability.‚Äù

<h2 id="ai-agents-act-like-employees-with-root-accessheres-how-to-regain-control"><a id="article-3"></a>AI Agents Act Like Employees With Root Access‚ÄîHere‚Äôs How to Regain Control</h2>

<p>The AI gold rush is on. But without identity-first security, every deployment becomes an open door. Most organizations secure native AI like a web app, but it behaves more like a junior employee with root access and no manager. From Hype to High Stakes
Generative AI has moved beyond the hype cycle.</p>

<p>Enterprises are:
Deploying LLM copilots to accelerate software development
Automating customer service workflows with AI agents
Integrating AI into financial operations and decision-making
Whether building with open-source models or plugging into platforms like OpenAI or Anthropic, the goal is speed and scale. But what most teams miss is this:
Every LLM access point or website is a new identity edge. And every integration adds risk unless identity and device posture are enforced. What Is the AI Build vs.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Buy Dilemma? Most enterprises face a pivotal decision:</dt>
  <dt>Build</dt>
  <dd>Create in-house agents tailored to internal systems and workflows
Buy</dd>
  <dd>Adopt commercial AI tools and SaaS integrations
The threat surface doesn‚Äôt care which path you choose. Custom-built agents
expand internal attack surfaces, especially if access control and identity segmentation aren‚Äôt enforced at runtime. Third-party tools
are often misused or accessed by unauthorized users, or more commonly, corporate users on personal accounts, where governance gaps exist.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Securing AI isn‚Äôt about the algorithm, it‚Äôs about who (or what device) is talking to it, and what permissions that interaction unlocks. What‚Äôs Actually at Risk? AI agents are agentic which is to say they can take actions on a human‚Äôs behalf and access data like a human would. They‚Äôre often embedded in business-critical systems, including:
Source code repositories
Finance and payroll applications
Email inboxes
CRM and ERP platforms
Customer support logs and case history
Once a user or device is compromised, the AI agent becomes a high-speed backdoor to sensitive data.</p>

<p>These systems are highly privileged, and AI amplifies attacker access. Common AI-Specific Threat Vectors:
Identity-based attacks
like credential stuffing or session hijacking targeting LLM APIs
Misconfigured agents
with excessive permissions and no scoped role-based access control (RBAC)
Weak session integrity
where infected or insecure devices request privileged actions through LLMs
How to Secure Enterprise AI Access
To eliminate AI access risk without killing innovation, you need:
Phishing-resistant MFA
for every user and device accessing LLMs or agent APIs
Granular RBAC
tied to business roles‚Äîdevelopers shouldn‚Äôt access finance models
Continuous device trust enforcement
, using signals from EDR, MDM, and ZTNA
AI access control must evolve from a one-time login check to a real-time policy engine that reflects current identity and device risk. The Secure AI Access Checklist:
No shared secrets
No trusted device assumptions
No over-permissioned agents
No productivity tax
The Fix: Secure AI Without Slowing Down
You don‚Äôt have to trade security for speed. With the right architecture, it‚Äôs possible to:
Block unauthorized users and devices by default
Eliminate trust assumptions at every layer
Secure AI workflows without interrupting legitimate use
Beyond Identity makes this possible today.</p>

<p>Beyond Identity‚Äôs IAM platform makes unauthorized access to AI systems impossible by enforcing phishing-resistant, device-aware, continuous access control for AI systems. No passwords. No shared secrets. No untrustworthy devices.</p>

<p>Beyond Identity is also prototyping a secure-by-design architecture for in-house AI agents that binds agent permissions to verified user identity and device posture‚Äîenforcing RBAC at runtime and continuously evaluating risk signals from EDR, MDM, and ZTNA. For instance, if an engineer loses CrowdStrike full disk access, the agent immediately blocks access to sensitive data until posture is remediated. Want a First Look?

how a Global Head of IT Security built and secured his internal, enterprise AI agents that‚Äôs now used by 1,000+ employees.</p>

<h2 id="new-konfety-malware-variant-evades-detection-by-manipulating-apks-and-dynamic-code"><a id="article-4"></a>New Konfety Malware Variant Evades Detection by Manipulating APKs and Dynamic Code</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new, sophisticated variant of a known Android malware referred to as
Konfety
that leverages the evil twin technique to enable ad fraud. The sneaky approach essentially involves a scenario wherein two variants of an application share the same package name: A benign ‚Äúdecoy‚Äù app that‚Äôs hosted on the Google Play Store and its evil twin, which is distributed via third-party sources. It‚Äôs worth pointing out that the decoy apps don‚Äôt have to be necessarily published by threat actors themselves and could be legitimate. The only caveat is that the malicious apps share the exact same package names as their real counterparts already available on the Play Store.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe threat actors behind Konfety are highly adaptable, consistently altering their targeted ad networks and updating their methods to evade detection,‚Äù Zimperium zLabs researcher Fernando Ortega
said
. ‚ÄúThis latest variant demonstrates their sophistication by specifically tampering with the APK‚Äôs ZIP structure.‚Äù
By using malformed APKs, the tactic allows threat actors to sidestep detection and challenge reverse engineering efforts. Besides dynamically loading the main DEX (Dalvik Executable) payload at runtime, the newly discovered versions enable the general-purpose bit flag by setting it to ‚Äú
Bit 0
,‚Äù signaling to the system that the file is encrypted. This behavior, in turn, triggers a false password prompt when attempting to inspect the Android package, thereby blocking access and complicating attempts to analyze its contents.</p>

<p>The second technique entails falsely declaring the use of BZIP compression method in the app‚Äôs manifest XML file (‚ÄúAndroidManifest.xml‚Äù), causing analysis tools like APKTool and JADX to crash due to a parsing failure. A similar compression-based defense evasion technique was previously highlighted by Kaspersky in another Android malware called
SoumniBot
. The use of dynamic code loading to execute the primary payload affords added stealth during initial scans or reverse engineering, Zimperium noted. During execution, the DEX payload is decrypted and loaded directly into memory without attracting any red flags.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis multi-layered obfuscation approach, combining encrypted assets, runtime code injection, and deceptive manifest declarations, demonstrates the evolving sophistication of the Konfety operation and its continuous efforts to evade analysis and bypass detection mechanisms,‚Äù Ortega said. Like the previous iteration reported by HUMAN last year, Konfety abuses the CaramelAds software development kit (SDK) to fetch ads, deliver payloads, and maintain communication with attacker-controlled servers. It comes with capabilities to redirect users to malicious websites, prompt unwanted app installs, and trigger persistent spam-like browser notifications. Furthermore, the malware hides its app icon and uses geofencing to alter its functionality based on the victim‚Äôs region.</p>

<p>The development comes as ANY.RUN detailed a Chinese Android
packer
tool known as Ducex that‚Äôs mainly designed to conceal embedded payloads like
Triada
within fake Telegram apps. ‚ÄúThe packer employs serious obfuscation through function encryption using a modified RC4 algorithm with added shuffling,‚Äù ANY.RUN researcher Alina Markova
said
. ‚ÄúDucex creates major roadblocks for debugging. It performs APK signature verification, failing if the app is re-signed.</p>

<p>It also employs self-debugging using fork and ptrace to block external tracing.‚Äù
On top of that, Ducex is designed to detect the presence of popular analysis tools such as Frida, Xposed, and Substrate, and if present, terminate itself. The findings also follow a new study published by a team of researchers from TU Wien and the University of Bayreuth about a novel technique dubbed TapTrap that can be weaponized by a malicious app to covertly bypass Android‚Äôs permission system and gain access to sensitive data or execute destructive actions. The attack, in a nutshell, hijacks user interactions on Android devices by overlaying animations or games on a user‚Äôs screen, while surreptitiously launching user interface elements underneath that trick users into performing undesirable actions, such as installing malware or granting the app intrusive permissions. ‚ÄúNormally, Android shows an animation when the screen changes, such as the new screen sliding or fading in,‚Äù researchers Philipp Beer, Marco Squarcina, Sebastian Roth, and Martina Lindorfer
said
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHowever, the app can tell the system that a custom animation should be used instead that is long-running and makes the new screen fully transparent, keeping it hidden from you.‚Äù
‚ÄúAny taps you make during this animation go to the hidden screen, not the visible app. The app can then use this to lure you into tapping on specific areas of the screen that correspond to sensitive actions on the hidden screen, allowing it to perform actions without your knowledge.‚Äù
In a hypothetical attack scenario, a threat actor-released game installed by the victim can secretly open a web browser session and dupe them into granting camera permissions to a malicious website. That said, TapTrap‚Äôs impact extends beyond the Android ecosystem, opening the door to tapjacking and web clickjacking attacks. The issue has been addressed in
GrapheneOS
, Chrome 135 (
CVE-2025-3067
), and Firefox 136 (
CVE-2025-1939
).</p>

<h2 id="between-buzz-and-reality-the-ctem-conversation-we-all-need"><a id="article-6"></a>Between Buzz and Reality: The CTEM Conversation We All Need</h2>

<p>I had the honor of hosting the first episode of the Xposure Podcast live from Xposure Summit 2025. And I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better kickoff panel: three cybersecurity leaders who don‚Äôt just talk security, they live it. Let me introduce them. Alex Delay
, CISO at IDB Bank, knows what it means to defend a highly regulated environment.</p>

<p>Ben Mead
, Director of Cybersecurity at Avidity Biosciences, brings a forward-thinking security perspective that reflects the innovation behind Avidity‚Äôs targeted RNA therapeutics. Last but not least,
Michael Francess
, Director of Cybersecurity Advanced Threat at Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, leads the charge in protecting the franchise. Each brought a unique vantage point to a common challenge: applying Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) to complex production environments. Gartner made waves in 2023 with a bold prediction: organizations that prioritize CTEM will be
three times less likely
to be breached by 2026.</p>

<p>But here‚Äôs the kicker - only if it‚Äôs operationalized. Speaking with these seasoned defenders, we unpacked the realities and challenges behind the hype of implementing and operationalizing an effective Exposure Management strategy, addressing the following tough questions:
What does a good CTEM program look like and what are the typical challenges that need to be overcome? How do you optimize cyber and risk reporting to influence board-level decisions? And ultimately, how do you measure the success of your CTEM program?</p>

<p>Challenges, Priorities, and Best Practices
CTEM isn‚Äôt plug-and-play. The panelists‚Äô prescription was clear: start with asset inventory and identity management; weak service accounts, over-permissioned users, legacy logins. None of these are small gaps, they‚Äôre wide-open doors that need to be checked frequently. And for all of our panelists, frequency matters - a lot.</p>

<p>Because guess what? Adversaries are constantly challenging defenses too. For internal assets, weekly validation is the rule of thumb. For external-facing assets?</p>

<p>Daily. As they see it, it‚Äôs the only way to maintain a constant handle over their constantly changing environments. Surprisingly, Michael pointed to threat intelligence as the backbone of any security testing program. ‚ÄúYou need to understand your adversaries, simulate their TTPs, and test your defenses against real-world scenarios, not just patching CVEs.‚Äù That‚Äôs the key difference between CTEM and vulnerability management.</p>

<p>Vulnerability management is about patching. Exposure management is about figuring out whether your controls actually work to block threats. Reporting: Translating Cyber to Risk Terms
In the banking industry, like many other highly regulated industries, Alex couldn‚Äôt emphasize enough the need to be prepared to answer hard questions asked from regulators. ‚ÄúYou
will
get challenged on your exposure, your remediation timelines, and your risk treatment.</p>

<p>And that‚Äôs a good thing. It forces clarity and accountability‚Äù. But even outside regulated industries, the conversation is changing. Boards do not want to hear about CVSS scores.</p>

<p>They want to understand
risk -
and that‚Äôs a completely different discussion. Is the company‚Äôs risk profile going up or down? Where is it concentrated? And what are we doing about it?</p>

<p>Measuring Progress
Success in CTEM isn‚Äôt about counting vulnerabilities; Ben pinned it down when he said he measures the number of exploited attack paths his team has closed. He shared how validating attack paths revealed risky security gaps, like over-permissioned accounts and forgotten assets. Suddenly, risk becomes visible. Others took it in another direction with tabletop exercises that walk leadership through real
attack scenarios.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not about metrics, it‚Äôs about explaining the risk and the consequences. A shift that moves the discussion from noise to signal, and gives the business clarity on what matters:

<h2 id="urgent-google-releases-critical-chrome-update-for-cve-2025-6558-exploit-active-in-the-wild"><a id="article-7"></a>Urgent: Google Releases Critical Chrome Update for CVE-2025-6558 Exploit Active in the Wild</h2>

<p>Google on Tuesday rolled out fixes for six security issues in its Chrome web browser, including one that it said has been exploited in the wild. The high-severity vulnerability in question is
CVE-2025-6558
(CVSS score: 8.8), which has been described as an incorrect validation of untrusted input in the browser‚Äôs ANGLE and GPU components. ‚ÄúInsufficient validation of untrusted input in ANGLE and GPU in Google Chrome prior to 138.0.7204.157 allowed a remote attacker to potentially perform a sandbox escape via a crafted HTML page,‚Äù according to the
description
of the flaw from the NIST‚Äôs National Vulnerability Database (NVD). ANGLE, short for ‚ÄúAlmost Native Graphics Layer Engine,‚Äù acts as a translation layer between Chrome‚Äôs rendering engine and device-specific graphics drivers.</p>

<p>Vulnerabilities in the module can let attackers escape Chrome‚Äôs sandbox by abusing low-level GPU operations that browsers usually keep isolated, making this a rare but powerful path to deeper system access. For most users, a sandbox escape like this means that visiting a malicious site is sufficient to potentially break out of the browser‚Äôs security bubble and interact with the underlying system. This is especially critical in targeted attacks where just opening a webpage could trigger a silent compromise without requiring any download or click. Cl√©ment Lecigne and Vlad Stolyarov of Google‚Äôs Threat Analysis Group (TAG) have been credited with discovering and reporting the zero-day vulnerability on June 23, 2025.</p>

<p>The exact nature of the attacks weaponizing the flaw has not been disclosed, but Google
acknowledged
that an ‚Äúexploit for CVE-2025-6558 exists in the wild.‚Äù That said, the discovery by TAG alludes to the possibility of nation-state involvement. The development comes about two weeks after Google addressed another actively exploited Chrome zero-day (
CVE-2025-6554
, CVSS score: 8.1), which was also reported by Lecigne on June 25, 2025. Google has resolved a total of five zero-day vulnerabilities in Chrome that have been either actively exploited or demonstrated as a proof-of-concept (PoC) since the start of the year. This includes:
CVE-2025-2783
,
CVE-2025-4664
,
CVE-2025-5419
, and
CVE-2025-6554
.</p>

<p>To safeguard against potential threats, it‚Äôs advised to update their Chrome browser to versions 138.0.7204.157/.158 for Windows and Apple macOS, and 138.0.7204.157 for Linux. To make sure the latest updates are installed, users can
navigate
to More &gt; Help &gt; About Google Chrome, and select Relaunch. Users of other Chromium-based browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi are also advised to apply the fixes as and when they become available. Issues like this often fall under broader categories like GPU sandbox escapes, shader-related bugs, or WebGL vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>While not always headline-grabbing, they tend to resurface in chained exploits or targeted attacks. If you follow Chrome security updates, it‚Äôs worth keeping an eye out for graphics driver flaws, privilege boundary bypasses, and memory corruption in rendering paths, as they often point to the next round of patch-worthy bugs.

<h2 id="google-ai-big-sleep-stops-exploitation-of-critical-sqlite-vulnerability-before-hackers-act"><a id="article-8"></a>Google AI ‚ÄúBig Sleep‚Äù Stops Exploitation of Critical SQLite Vulnerability Before Hackers Act</h2>

<p>Google on Tuesday revealed that its large language model (LLM)-assisted vulnerability discovery framework discovered a security flaw in the SQLite open-source database engine before it could have been exploited in the wild. The vulnerability, tracked as
CVE-2025-6965
(CVSS score: 7.2), is a memory corruption flaw affecting all versions prior to 3.50.2. It was discovered by
Big Sleep
, an artificial intelligence (AI) agent that was launched by Google last year as part of a collaboration between DeepMind and Google Project Zero. ‚ÄúAn attacker who can inject arbitrary SQL statements into an application might be able to cause an integer overflow resulting in read off the end of an array,‚Äù SQLite project maintainers
said
in an advisory.</p>

<p>The tech giant described CVE-2025-6965 as a critical security issue that was ‚Äúknown only to threat actors and was at risk of being exploited.‚Äù Google did not reveal who the threat actors were. ‚ÄúThrough the combination of threat intelligence and Big Sleep, Google was able to actually predict that a vulnerability was imminently going to be used and we were able to cut it off beforehand,‚Äù Kent Walker, President of Global Affairs at Google and Alphabet,
said
. ‚ÄúWe believe this is the first time an AI agent has been used to directly foil efforts to exploit a vulnerability in the wild.‚Äù
In October 2024, Big Sleep was
behind
the discovery of another flaw in SQLite, a stack buffer underflow vulnerability that could have been exploited to result in a crash or arbitrary code execution. Coinciding with the development, Google has also published a white paper to build secure AI agents such that they have well-defined human controllers, their capabilities are carefully limited to avoid potential rogue actions and sensitive data disclosure, and their actions are observable and transparent.</p>

<p>‚ÄúTraditional systems security approaches (such as restrictions on agent actions implemented through classical software) lack the contextual awareness needed for versatile agents and can overly restrict utility,‚Äù Google‚Äôs Santiago (Sal) D√≠az, Christoph Kern, and Kara Olive
said
. ‚ÄúConversely, purely reasoning-based security (relying solely on the AI model‚Äôs judgment) is insufficient because current LLMs remain susceptible to manipulations like prompt injection and cannot yet offer sufficiently robust guarantees.‚Äù
To mitigate the key risks associated with agent security, the company said it has adopted a hybrid defense-in-depth approach that combines the strengths of both traditional, deterministic controls and dynamic, reasoning-based defenses. The idea is to create robust boundaries around the agent‚Äôs operational environment so that the risk of harmful outcomes is significantly mitigated, specifically malicious actions carried out as a result of prompt injection. ‚ÄúThis defense-in-depth approach relies on enforced boundaries around the AI agent‚Äôs operational environment to prevent potential worst-case scenarios, acting as guardrails even if the agent‚Äôs internal reasoning process becomes compromised or misaligned by sophisticated attacks or unexpected inputs,‚Äù Google said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis multi-layered approach recognizes that neither purely rule-based systems nor purely AI-based judgment are sufficient on their own.‚Äù

<h2 id="hyper-volumetric-ddos-attacks-reach-record-73-tbps-targeting-key-global-sectors"><a id="article-9"></a>Hyper-Volumetric DDoS Attacks Reach Record 7.3 Tbps, Targeting Key Global Sectors</h2>

<p>Cloudflare on Tuesday said it mitigated 7.3 million distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks in the second quarter of 2025, a significant drop from
20.5 million DDoS attacks
it fended off the previous quarter. ‚ÄúOverall, in Q2 2025, hyper-volumetric DDoS attacks skyrocketed,‚Äù Omer Yoachimik and Jorge Pacheco
said
. ‚ÄúCloudflare blocked over 6,500 hyper-volumetric DDoS attacks, an average of 71 per day.‚Äù
In Q1 2025, the company said an 18-day sustained campaign against its own and other critical infrastructure protected by Cloudflare was responsible for 13.5 million of the attacks observed during the time period. Cumulatively, Cloudflare has blocked nearly 28 million DDoS attacks, surpassing the number of attacks it mitigated in all of 2024.</p>

<p>The notable of the attacks in Q2 2025 is a
staggering DDoS attack
that peaked at 7.3 terabits per second (Tbps) and 4.8 billion packets per second (Bpps) within a span of 45 seconds. Big traffic spikes like these make headlines‚Äîbut what often gets missed is how attackers are now combining them with smaller, targeted probes. Instead of just overwhelming systems with brute force, they‚Äôre mixing large-scale floods with quiet scans to find weak spots and slip past defenses built to block only the obvious. Layer 3/Layer 4 (L3/4) DDoS attacks
declined 81% quarter-over-quarter to 3.2 million, while HTTP DDoS attacks rose 9% to 4.1 million.</p>

<p>More than 70% of the HTTP DDoS attacks emanated from known botnets. The most common L3/4 attack vectors were flood attacks conducted over DNS, TCP SYN, and UDP protocols. Telecommunication service providers and carriers were among the most targeted, followed by the Internet, IT services, gaming, and gambling sectors. China, Brazil, Germany, India, South Korea, Turkey, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Russia, and Azerbaijan emerged as the most attacked locations based on the billing country of the Cloudflare customers.</p>

<p>Indonesia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Argentina, and Ukraine were the top five sources of DDoS attacks. The web infrastructure and security company also revealed that the number of hyper-volumetric DDoS attacks exceeding 100 million packets per second (pps) increased by 592% compared to the previous quarter. Another significant aspect is the 68% increase in ransom DDoS attack, which occurs when malicious actors attempt to extort money from an organization by threatening them with a DDoS attack. It also involves scenarios where the attacks are carried out and a ransom is demanded to stop it from happening again.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhile the majority of DDoS attacks are small, hyper-volumetric DDoS attacks are increasing in size and frequency,‚Äù Cloudflare said. ‚ÄúSix out of every 100 HTTP DDoS attacks exceed 1M rps, and 5 out of every 10,000 L3/4 DDoS attacks exceed 1 Tbps ‚Äî a 1,150% QoQ increase.‚Äù
The company further has called attention to a botnet variant dubbed
DemonBot
that infects Linux-based systems, predominantly unsecured IoT devices, via open ports or weak credentials to enlist them into a DDoS botnet that can carry out UDP, TCP, and application-layer floods. ‚ÄúAttacks are typically command-and-control (C2) driven and can generate significant volumetric traffic, often targeting gaming, hosting, or enterprise services,‚Äù it added. ‚ÄúTo avoid infection, leverage antivirus software and domain filtering.‚Äù
Infection vectors like those exploited by DemonBot highlight broader challenges with unsecured IoT exposure, weak SSH credentials, and outdated firmware‚Äîcommon themes across DDoS botnet proliferation.</p>

<h2 id="newly-emerged-global-group-raas-expands-operations-with-ai-driven-negotiation-tools"><a id="article-10"></a>Newly Emerged GLOBAL GROUP RaaS Expands Operations with AI-Driven Negotiation Tools</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have shed light on a new ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation called
GLOBAL GROUP
that has targeted a wide range of sectors in Australia, Brazil, Europe, and the United States since its emergence in early June 2025. GLOBAL GROUP was ‚Äúpromoted on the Ramp4u forum by the threat actor known as ‚Äò$$$,‚Äô‚Äù EclecticIQ researcher Arda B√ºy√ºkkaya
said
. ‚ÄúThe same actor controls the BlackLock RaaS and previously managed Mamona ransomware operations.‚Äù
It‚Äôs believed that GLOBAL GROUP is a rebranding of BlackLock after the latter‚Äôs data leak site was
defaced
by the DragonForce ransomware cartel back in March. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that BlackLock in itself is a rebrand of another RaaS scheme known as Eldorado.</p>

<p>The financially motivated group has been found to lean heavily on initial access brokers (IABs) to deploy the ransomware by weaponizing access to vulnerable edge appliances from Cisco, Fortinet, and Palo Alto Networks. Also put to use are brute-force utilities for Microsoft Outlook and RDWeb portals. $$$ has acquired Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or web shell access to corporate networks, such as those related to law firms, as a way to deploy post-exploitation tools, conduct lateral movement, siphon data, and deploy the ransomware. Outsourcing the infiltration phase to other threat actors, who supply pre-compromised entry points into enterprise networks, allows affiliates to expend their efforts on payload delivery, extortion, and negotiation rather than network penetration.</p>

<p>The RaaS platform comes with a negotiation portal and an affiliate panel, the latter of which allows cybercriminals to manage victims, build ransomware payloads for VMware ESXi, NAS, BSD, and Windows, and monitor operations. In a bid to entice more affiliates, the threat actors promise a revenue-sharing model of 85%. ‚ÄúGLOBAL GROUP‚Äôs ransom negotiation panel features an automated system powered by AI-driven chatbots,‚Äù the Dutch security company said. ‚ÄúThis enables non-English-speaking affiliates to engage victims more effectively.‚Äù
As of July 14, 2025, the RaaS group has claimed 17 victims in Australia, Brazil, Europe, and the United States, spanning healthcare, oil-and-gas equipment fabrication, industrial machinery and precision engineering, automotive repair, accident-recovery services, and large-scale business process outsourcing (BPO).</p>

<p>The links to BlackLock and Mamona stem from the use of the same Russian VPS provider IpServer and source code similarities with Mamona. Specifically, GLOBAL GROUP is said to be an evolution of Mamona with added features to enable domain-wide ransomware installation. What‚Äôs more, the malware is also written in Go, just like BlackLock. ‚ÄúThe creation of GLOBAL GROUP by BlackLock‚Äôs administrator is a deliberate strategy to modernize operations, expand revenue streams, and stay competitive in the ransomware market,‚Äù B√ºy√ºkkaya said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis new brand integrates AI-powered negotiation, mobile-friendly panels, and customizable payload builders, appealing to a broader pool of affiliates.‚Äù
The disclosure comes as the
Qilin
ransomware group emerged as the most active RaaS operation in June 2025, accounting for 81 victims. Other major players include Akira (34), Play (30), SafePay (27), and DragonForce (25). ‚ÄúSafePay saw the steepest decline at 62.5%, suggesting a major pullback,‚Äù cybersecurity company CYFIRMA
said
. ‚ÄúDragonForce emerged rapidly, with attacks spiking by 212.5%.‚Äù
In all, the total number of ransomware victims has dropped from 545 in May to 463 in June 2025, a 15% decline.</p>

<p>February tops this year‚Äôs list with 956 victims. ‚ÄúDespite the decline in numbers, geopolitical tensions and high-profile cyber attacks highlight growing instability, potentially heightening the risk of cyber threats,‚Äù NCC Group
noted
late last month. According to data gathered by Optiv‚Äôs Global Threat Intelligence Center (gTIC), 314 ransomware victims were listed on 74 unique data leak sites in Q1 2025, representing a 213% increase in the number of victims. A total of 56 variants were observed in Q1 2024.</p>

<p>‚ÄúRansomware operators continued to use tried-and-true methods to gain initial access to victims ‚Äì social engineering/phishing, exploitation of software vulnerabilities, compromising exposed and insecure software, supply-chain attacks and leveraging the initial access broker (IAB) community,‚Äù Optiv researcher Emily Lee

<h2 id="state-backed-hazybeacon-malware-uses-aws-lambda-to-steal-data-from-se-asian-governments"><a id="article-11"></a>State-Backed HazyBeacon Malware Uses AWS Lambda to Steal Data from SE Asian Governments</h2>

<p>Governmental organizations in Southeast Asia are the target of a new campaign that aims to collect sensitive information by means of a previously undocumented Windows backdoor dubbed
HazyBeacon
. The activity is being tracked by Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 under the moniker
CL-STA-1020
, where ‚ÄúCL‚Äù stands for ‚Äúcluster‚Äù and ‚ÄúSTA‚Äù refers to ‚Äústate-backed motivation.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe threat actors behind this cluster of activity have been collecting sensitive information from government agencies, including information about recent tariffs and trade disputes,‚Äù security researcher Lior Rochberger
said
in a Monday analysis. Southeast Asia has increasingly become a focal point for cyber espionage due to its role in sensitive trade negotiations, military modernization, and strategic alignment in the U.S.‚ÄìChina power dynamic. Targeting government agencies in this region can provide valuable intelligence on foreign policy direction, infrastructure planning, and internal regulatory shifts that influence regional and global markets.</p>

<p>The exact initial access vector used to deliver the malware is currently not known, although evidence shows the use of DLL side-loading techniques to deploy it on compromised hosts. Specifically, it involves planting a malicious version of a DLL called ‚Äúmscorsvc.dll‚Äù along with the legitimate Windows executable, ‚Äú
mscorsvw.exe
.‚Äù
Once the binary is launched, the DLL proceeds to establish communication with an attacker-controlled URL that allows it to execute arbitrary commands and download additional payloads. Persistence is achieved by means of a service that ensures the DLL is launched even after a reboot of the system. HazyBeacon is notable for the fact that it leverages Amazon Web Services (AWS) Lambda URLs for command-and-control (C2) purposes, demonstrating threat actors‚Äô continued abuse of legitimate services to fly under the radar and escape detection.</p>

<p>‚Äù
AWS Lambda URLs
are a feature of AWS Lambda that allows users to invoke serverless functions directly over HTTPS,‚Äù Rochberger explained. ‚ÄúThis technique uses legitimate cloud functionality to hide in plain sight, creating a reliable, scalable and difficult-to-detect communication channel.‚Äù
Defenders should pay attention to outbound traffic to rarely used cloud endpoints like
<em>.lambda-url.</em>.amazonaws.com
, especially when initiated by unusual binaries or system services. While AWS usage itself isn‚Äôt suspicious, context-aware baselining‚Äîsuch as correlating process origins, parent-child execution chains, and endpoint behavior‚Äîcan help distinguish legitimate activity from malware leveraging cloud-native evasion. Downloaded among the payloads is a file collector module that‚Äôs responsible for harvesting files matching a specific set of extensions (e.g., doc, docx, xls, xlsx, and pdf) and within a time range.</p>

<p>This includes attempts to search for files related to the recent tariff measures imposed by the United States. The threat actor has also been found to employ other services like Google Drive and Dropbox as exfiltration channels so as to blend in with normal network traffic and transmit the gathered data. In the incident analyzed by Unit 42, attempts to upload the files to the cloud storage services are said to have been blocked. In the final stage, the attackers run cleanup commands to avoid leaving traces of their activity, deleting all the archives of staged files and other payloads downloaded during the attack.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe threat actors used HazyBeacon as the main tool for maintaining a foothold and collecting sensitive information from the affected governmental entities,‚Äù Rochberger said. ‚ÄúThis campaign highlights how attackers continue to find new ways to abuse legitimate, trusted cloud services.‚Äù
HazyBeacon reflects a broader trend of advanced persistent threats using trusted platforms as covert channels‚Äîa tactic often referred to as ‚Äúliving-off-trusted-services‚Äù (LOTS). As part of this cloud-based malware cluster, similar techniques have been observed in threats using Google Workspace, Microsoft Teams, or Dropbox APIs to evade detection and facilitate persistent access.

<h2 id="securing-agentic-ai-how-to-protect-the-invisible-identity-access"><a id="article-12"></a>Securing Agentic AI: How to Protect the Invisible Identity Access</h2>

<p>AI agents promise to automate everything from financial reconciliations to incident response. Yet every time an AI agent spins up a workflow, it has to authenticate somewhere; often with a high-privilege API key, OAuth token, or service account that defenders can‚Äôt easily see. These ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù non-human identities (NHIs) now outnumber human accounts in most cloud environments, and they have become one of the ripest targets for attackers. Astrix‚Äôs Field CTO Jonathan Sander put it bluntly in a recent
Hacker News webinar
:
‚ÄúOne dangerous habit we‚Äôve had for a long time is trusting application logic to act as the guardrails.</p>

<p>That doesn‚Äôt work when your AI agent is powered by LLMs that don‚Äôt stop and think when they‚Äôre about to do something wrong. They just do it.‚Äù
Why AI Agents Redefine Identity Risk
Autonomy changes everything:
An AI agent can chain multiple API calls and modify data without a human in the loop. If the underlying credential is exposed or overprivileged, each additional action amplifies the blast radius. LLMs behave unpredictably:
Traditional code follows deterministic rules; large language models operate on probability.</p>

<p>That means you cannot guarantee how or where an agent will use the access you grant it. Existing IAM tools were built for humans:
Most identity governance platforms focus on employees, not tokens. They lack the context to map which NHIs belong to which agents, who owns them, and what those identities can actually touch. Treat AI Agents Like First-Class (Non-Human) Users
Successful security programs already apply ‚Äúhuman-grade‚Äù controls like birth, life, and retirement to service accounts and machine credentials.</p>

<p>Extending the same discipline to AI agents delivers quick wins
without blocking business innovation. Human Identity Control
How It Applies to AI Agents
Owner assignment
Every agent must have a named human owner (for example, the developer who configured a Custom GPT) who is accountable for its access. Least privilege
Start from read-only scopes, then grant narrowly scoped write actions the moment the agent proves it needs them. Lifecycle governance
Decommission credentials the moment an agent is deprecated, and rotate secrets automatically on a schedule.</p>

<p>Continuous monitoring
Watch for anomalous calls (e.g., sudden spikes to sensitive APIs) and revoke access in real time. Secure AI Agent Access
Enterprises shouldn‚Äôt have to choose between security and agility. Astrix makes it easy to protect innovation without slowing it down, delivering all essential controls in one intuitive platform:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Discovery and Governance
Automatically discover and map all AI agents, including external and homegrown agents, with context into their associated NHIs, permissions, owners, and accessed environments.</li>
</ol>

<p>Prioritize remediation efforts based on automated risk scoring based on agent exposure levels and configuration weaknesses. 2. Lifecycle management
Manage AI agents and the NHIs they rely on from provisioning to decommissioning through automated ownership, policy enforcement, and streamlined remediation processes, without the manual overhead. 3.</p>

<p>Threat detection &amp; response
Continuously monitor AI agent activity to detect deviations, out-of-scope actions, and abnormal behaviors, while automating remediation with real-time alerts, workflows, and investigation guides. The Instant Impact: From Risk to ROI in 30 Days
Within the first month of deploying Astrix, our customers consistently report three transformative business wins within the first month of deployment:
Reduced risk, zero blind spots
Automated discovery
and a single source of truth for every AI agent, NHI, and secret reveal unauthorized third-party connections, over-entitled tokens, and policy violations the moment they appear. Short-lived, least-privileged identities prevent credential sprawl before it starts. ‚ÄúAstrix gave us full visibility into high-risk NHIs and helped us take action without slowing down the business.‚Äù

. The Bottom Line
AI agents unlock historic productivity, yet they also magnify the identity problem security teams have wrestled with for years.

<h2 id="asyncrats-open-source-code-sparks-surge-in-dangerous-malware-variants-across-the-globe"><a id="article-13"></a>AsyncRAT‚Äôs Open-Source Code Sparks Surge in Dangerous Malware Variants Across the Globe</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have charted the evolution of a widely used remote access trojan called
AsyncRAT
, which was first released on GitHub in January 2019 and has since served as the foundation for several other variants. ‚ÄúAsyncRAT has cemented its place as a cornerstone of modern malware and as a pervasive threat that has evolved into a sprawling network of forks and variants,‚Äù ESET researcher Nikola Kne≈æeviƒá
said
in a report shared with The Hacker News. ‚ÄúWhile its capabilities are not that impressive on their own, it is the open-source nature of AsyncRAT that has truly amplified its impact. Its plug-in-based architecture and ease of modification have sparked the proliferation of many forks, pushing the boundaries even further‚Äù
While AsyncRAT‚Äôs evolution highlights its technical adaptability, its real-world impact stems from how it‚Äôs deployed in opportunistic phishing campaigns and bundled with loaders like GuLoader or SmokeLoader.</p>

<p>These delivery methods enable rapid distribution through cracked software, malicious ads, or fake updates ‚Äì targeting users in both corporate and consumer environments. Without early detection, AsyncRAT often acts as a tool for information theft and remote control. First
published
on GitHub by NYAN CAT, the C#-based malware is equipped to capture screenshots, log keystrokes, steal credentials, and allow attackers to commandeer infected systems stealthily, exfiltrate data, and execute malicious instructions. The modular tool‚Äôs simplicity and open-source nature, coupled with its modular architecture and enhanced stealth features, has not only made it very adaptable and harder to detect, but also an attractive option for threat actors, as
evidenced
by the
myriad
campaigns
distributing
the
threat
over the years
.</p>

<p>The Slovak cybersecurity company said the ‚Äúgroundwork‚Äù for AsyncRAT was laid earlier by another open-source RAT known as
Quasar RAT
(aka CinaRAT or Yggdrasil) that has been available on GitHub since 2015. Although both the malware strains are coded in C#, the wide-ranging differences between them suggest that AsyncRAT was much more than a fork: It was a major rewrite. The two pieces of malware are united by the use of the same custom cryptography classes used to decrypt the malware configuration settings. Since the release of AsyncRAT, the malware has spawned diverse variants, including
DCRat
(aka DarkCrystal RAT) and
Venom RAT
.</p>

<p>DCRat marks a significant improvement over AsyncRAT, packing in evasion techniques to fly under the radar and augmenting its capabilities to gather webcam data, microphone recordings, and Discord tokens, alongside even a module to encrypt files. ‚ÄúDCRat also implements evasion techniques like AMSI and ETW patching, which work by disabling security features that detect and log malicious behavior,‚Äù ESET said. ‚ÄúAddi5onally, it features an anti-process system whereby processes whose names match those in a denylist are terminated.‚Äù
Venom RAT, on the other hand, is said to have been inspired by DCRat, while also packing in enough unique features of its own. ‚ÄúWhile they indeed belong to the Quasar RAT family, they are still different RATs,‚Äù Rapid7 researcher Anna ≈†irokova
noted
in an analysis of AsyncRAT and Venom RAT in November 2024.</p>

<p>‚ÄúVenom RAT presents more advanced evasion techniques, making it a more sophisticated threat.‚Äù
ESET said it also identified lesser-known variants of AsyncRAT, such as
NonEuclid RAT
, which incorporates plugins to brute-force SSH and FTP credentials, collect geolocation, act as a
clipper
by substituting clipboard data with the attacker‚Äôs cryptocurrency wallet addresses, and even spread the malware by compromising portable executable files with an arbitrary payload. JasonRAT, for its part, introduces bespoke changes of its own, such as the ability to target systems based on country. Likewise,
XieBroRAT
features a browser credential stealer and a plugin to interact with Cobalt Strike servers via a reverse connection. It‚Äôs also
adapted
for the Chinese market.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAsyncRAT‚Äôs rise and its subsequent forks highlight the inherent risks of open-source malware frameworks,‚Äù ESET said. ‚ÄúAll of these forks not only extend AsyncRAT‚Äôs technical capabilities but also demonstrate how quickly and creatively threat actors can adapt and repurpose open-source code.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe widespread availability of such frameworks significantly lowers the barrier to entry for aspiring cybercriminals, enabling even novices to deploy sophisticated malware with minimal eÔ¨Äort. This democratization of malware development ‚Äì especially considering the rising popularity of LLMs and potential to misuse their capabilities ‚Äì further accelerates the creation and customization of malicious tools, contributing to a rapidly expanding and increasingly complex threat landscape.‚Äù
This shift has also fueled the rise of malware-as-a-service (MaaS), where preconfigured AsyncRAT builders and plug-and-play modules are sold openly on Telegram and dark web forums. The growing overlap between open-source malware, penetration testing tools, and commercial remote access frameworks complicates attribution and defense.</p>

<p>For security teams, this means greater focus on behavioral detection, command-and-control (C2) analysis, and understanding how fileless persistence, clipboard hijacking, and credential theft converge in modern malware campaigns. Found this article interesting? Follow us on
