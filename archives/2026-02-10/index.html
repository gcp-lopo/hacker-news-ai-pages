<h2 id="china-linked-unc3886-targets-singapore-telecom-sector-in-cyber-espionage-campaign"><a id="article-1"></a>China-Linked UNC3886 Targets Singapore Telecom Sector in Cyber Espionage Campaign</h2>

<p>The Cyber Security Agency (CSA) of Singapore on Monday revealed that the China-nexus cyber espionage group known as
UNC3886
targeted its telecommunications sector. “UNC3886 had launched a deliberate, targeted, and well-planned campaign against Singapore’s telecommunications sector,” CSA
said
. “All four of Singapore’s major telecommunications operators (‘telcos’) – M1, SIMBA Telecom, Singtel, and StarHub – have been the target of attacks.”
The development comes more than six months after Singapore’s Coordinating Minister for National Security, K. Shanmugam,
accused
UNC3886 of striking high-value strategic threat targets.</p>

<p>UNC3886 is assessed to be active since at least 2022, targeting edge devices and virtualization technologies to obtain initial access. In July 2025, Sygnia
disclosed
details of a long-term cyber espionage campaign attributed to a threat cluster it tracks as Fire Ant and which shares tooling and targeting overlaps with UNC3886, stating the adversary infiltrates organizations’ VMware ESXi and vCenter environments as well as network appliances. Describing UNC3886 as an advanced persistent threat (APT) with “deep capabilities,” CSA said the threat actors deployed sophisticated tools to gain access into telco systems, in one instance even weaponizing a zero-day exploit to bypass a perimeter firewall and siphon a small amount of technical data to further its operational objectives. The exact specifics of the flaw were not disclosed.</p>

<p>In a second case, UNC3886 is said to have deployed rootkits to establish persistent access and conceal their tracks to fly under the radar. Other activities undertaken by the threat actor include gaining unauthorized access to “some parts” of telco networks and systems, including those deemed critical, although it’s assessed that the incident was not severe enough to disrupt services. CSA said it mounted a cyber operation dubbed CYBER GUARDIAN to counter the threat and limit the attackers’ movement into telecom networks. It also emphasized that there is no evidence that the threat actor exfiltrated personal data such as customer records or cut off internet availability.</p>

<p>“Cyber defenders have since implemented remediation measures, closed off UNC3886’s access points, and expanded monitoring capabilities in the targeted telcos,” the agency said. Found this article interesting? Follow us on

<h2 id="solarwinds-web-help-desk-exploited-for-rce-in-multi-stage-attacks-on-exposed-servers"><a id="article-2"></a>SolarWinds Web Help Desk Exploited for RCE in Multi-Stage Attacks on Exposed Servers</h2>

<p>Microsoft has
revealed
that it observed a multi‑stage intrusion that involved the threat actors exploiting internet‑exposed SolarWinds Web Help Desk (WHD) instances to obtain initial access and move laterally across the organization’s network to other high-value assets. That said, the Microsoft Defender Security Research Team said it’s not clear whether the activity weaponized
recently disclosed flaws
(CVE-2025-40551, CVSS score: 9.8, and CVE-2025-40536, CVSS score: 8.1), or a
previously patched vulnerability
(CVE-2025-26399, CVSS score: 9.8). “Since the attacks occurred in December 2025 and on machines vulnerable to both the old and new set of CVEs at the same time, we cannot reliably confirm the exact CVE used to gain an initial foothold,” the company said in a report published last week. While CVE-2025-40536 is a security control bypass vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to certain restricted functionality, CVE-2025-40551 and CVE-2025-26399 both refer to untrusted data deserialization vulnerabilities that could lead to remote code execution.</p>

<p>Last week, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
added
CVE-2025-40551 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation in the wild. Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies were ordered to apply the fixes for the flaw by February 6, 2026. In the attacks detected by Microsoft, successful exploitation of the exposed SolarWinds WHD instance allowed the attackers to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution and run arbitrary commands within the WHD application context.</p>

<p>“Upon successful exploitation, the compromised service of a WHD instance spawned PowerShell to leverage
BITS
[Background Intelligent Transfer Service] for payload download and execution,” researchers Sagar Patil, Hardik Suri, Eric Hopper, and Kajhon Soyini noted. In the next stage, the threat actors downloaded legitimate components associated with Zoho ManageEngine, a legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) solution, to enable persistent remote control over the infected system. The attackers followed it up with a series of actions -
Enumerated sensitive domain users and groups, including Domain Admins. Established persistence via reverse SSH and RDP access, with the attackers also attempting to create a scheduled task to launch a QEMU virtual machine under the SYSTEM account at system startup to cover up the tracks within a virtualized environment while exposing SSH access via port forwarding.</p>

<p>Used DLL side-loading on some hosts by using “wab.exe,” a legitimate system executable associated with the Windows Address Book, to launch a rogue DLL (“sspicli.dll”) to dump the contents of LSASS memory and conduct credential theft. In at least one case, Microsoft said the threat actors conducted a
DCSync attack
, where a Domain Controller (DC) is
simulated
to request
password hashes
and other sensitive information from an Active Directory (AD) database. To counter the threat, users are advised to keep the WHD instances up-to-date, find and remove any unauthorized RMM tools, rotate service and admin accounts, and isolate compromised machines to limit the breach. “This activity reflects a common but high-impact pattern: a single exposed application can provide a path to full domain compromise when vulnerabilities are unpatched or insufficiently monitored,” the Windows maker said.</p>

<p>“In this intrusion, attackers relied heavily on living-off-the-land techniques, legitimate administrative tools, and low-noise persistence mechanisms. These tradecraft choices reinforce the importance of defense in depth, timely patching of internet-facing services, and behavior-based detection across identity, endpoint, and network layers.”
Update
In a report published on February 8, 2026, cybersecurity company Huntress
said
it investigated a case of SolarWinds WHD exploitation, in which the threat actor rapidly deployed Zoho Meetings and Cloudflare tunnels for persistence, as well as a legitimate forensics tool called
Velociraptor
for command-and-control (C2). The incident occurred on February 7, 2026. The following sequence of post-exploitation actions describes how the attack unfolded -
Launched “cmd.exe” to install a remote MSI payload associated with Zoho ManageEngine RMM and established remote access by configuring the Zoho Assist agent for unattended access and registering the compromised host to a Zoho Assist account tied to a Proton Mail address “esmahyft@proton[.]me.”
Executed Active Directory discovery commands to enumerate domain-joined machines for reconnaissance.</p>

<p>Leveraged the Zoho Assist remote session to deploy Velociraptor version 0.73.4, an outdated version with a known privilege escalation vulnerability (
CVE-2025-6264
). Used the Velociraptor agent to execute PowerShell commands to check for the presence of “code.exe,” a Visual Studio Code binary with the likely intent of establishing a remote tunnel. Installed
Cloudflared
to establish an additional tunnel-based channel for redundant access to the compromised host. Executed a PowerShell script that collects comprehensive system information and transmits it directly to an attacker-controlled Elastic Cloud instance.</p>

<p>Disabled Windows Defender and Windows Firewall via Registry modifications. Executed a script that implements a live C2 failover mechanism for the Velociraptor agent to connect it to a different server (“v2-api.mooo[.]com”) if the original Cloudflare workers[.]dev domain has been detected. It achieves this by sending a request to the failover server and checking the HTTP response code. If the status is
406 Not Acceptable
, the Velociraptor is reconfigured to talk to the new server.</p>

<p>Created scheduled tasks that use QEMU to open an SSH backdoor as a persistence mechanism. “The Velociraptor server URL, https://auth.qgtxtebl.workers[.]dev/, utilizes a Cloudflare Worker from the same Cloudflare account we have seen before across multiple intrusions involving ToolShell exploitation, and
Warlock
ransomware deployment, identified by the shared per-account identifier component of the subdomain: qgtxtebl,” Huntress researchers noted. Found this article interesting? Follow us on

<h2 id="-weekly-recap-ai-skill-malware-31tbps-ddos-notepad-hack-llm-backdoors-and-more"><a id="article-3"></a>⚡ Weekly Recap: AI Skill Malware, 31Tbps DDoS, Notepad++ Hack, LLM Backdoors and More</h2>

<p>Cyber threats are no longer coming from just malware or exploits. They’re showing up inside the tools, platforms, and ecosystems organizations use every day. As companies connect AI, cloud apps, developer tools, and communication systems, attackers are following those same paths. A clear pattern this week: attackers are abusing trust.</p>

<p>Trusted updates, trusted marketplaces, trusted apps, even trusted AI workflows. Instead of breaking security controls head-on, they’re slipping into places that already have access. This recap brings together those signals — showing how modern attacks are blending technology abuse, ecosystem manipulation, and large-scale targeting into a single, expanding threat surface. ⚡ Threat of the Week
OpenClaw announces VirusTotal Partnership
— OpenClaw has announced a partnership with Google’s VirusTotal malware scanning platform to scan skills that are being uploaded to ClawHub as part of a defense-in-depth approach to improve the security of the agentic ecosystem.</p>

<p>The development comes as the cybersecurity community has raised concerns that autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) tools’ persistent memory, broad permissions, and user‑controlled configuration could amplify existing risks, leading to prompt injections, data exfiltration, and exposure to unvetted components. This has also been complemented by the discovery of
malicious skills on ClawHub
, a public skills registry to augment the capabilities of AI agents, once again demonstrating that marketplaces are a gold mine for criminals who populate the store with malware to prey on developers. To make matters worse, Trend Micro disclosed that it observed malicious actors on the Exploit.in forum actively discussing the deployment of OpenClaw skills to support activities such as botnet operations. Another report from Veracode
revealed
that the number of packages on npm and PyPI with the name “claw” has increased exponentially from nearly zero at the start of the year to over 1,000 as of early February 2026, providing new avenues for threat actors to smuggle malicious typosquats.</p>

<p>“Unsupervised deployment, broad permissions, and high autonomy can turn theoretical risks into tangible threats, not just for individual users but also across entire organizations,” Trend Micro
said
. “Open-source agentic tools like OpenClaw require a higher baseline of user security competence than managed platforms.”
Bad Actors Are Using New AI Capabilities and Powerful AI Agents
Traditional firewalls and VPNs aren’t helping—instead, they’re expanding your attack surface and enabling lateral threat movement. They’re also more easily exploited with AI-powered attacks. It’s time for Zero Trust + AI.</p>

German Agencies Warn of Signal Phishing
— Germany’s Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (aka Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz or BfV) and Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) have issued a joint advisory warning of a malicious cyber campaign undertaken by a likely state-sponsored threat actor that involves carrying out phishing attacks over the Signal messaging app. The attacks have been mainly directed at high-ranking targets in politics, the military, and diplomacy, as well as investigative journalists in Germany and Europe. The attack chains exploit legitimate PIN and device linking features in Signal to take control of victims’ accounts. AISURU Botnet Behind 31.4 Tbps DDoS Attack
— The botnet known as AISURU/Kimwolf has been attributed to a record-setting distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that peaked at 31.4 Terabits per second (Tbps) and lasted only 35 seconds.</p>

<p>The attack took place in November 2025, according to Cloudflare, which automatically detected and mitigated the activity. AISURU/Kimwolf has also been linked to another DDoS campaign codenamed The Night Before Christmas that commenced on December 19, 2025. In all, DDoS attacks surged by 121% in 2025, reaching an average of 5,376 attacks automatically mitigated every hour. Notepad++ Hosting Infrastructure Breached to Distribute Chrysalis Backdoor
— Between June and October 2025, threat actors quietly and very selectively redirected traffic from Notepad++’s updater program, WinGUp, to an attacker-controlled server that downloaded malicious executables.</p>

<p>While the attacker lost their foothold on the third-party hosting provider’s server on September 2, 2025, following scheduled maintenance where the server firmware and kernel were updated. However, the attackers still had valid credentials in their possession, which they used to continue routing Notepad++ update traffic to their malicious servers until at least December 2, 2025. The adversary specifically targeted the Notepad++ domain by taking advantage of its insufficient update verification controls that existed in older versions of Notepad++. The findings show that updates cannot be treated as trusted just because they come from a legitimate domain, as the blind spot can be abused as a vector for malware distribution.</p>

<p>The sophisticated supply chain attack has been attributed to a threat actor known as Lotus Blossom. “Attackers prize distribution points that touch a large population,” a Forrester analysis
said
. “Update servers, download portals, package managers, and hosting platforms become efficient delivery systems, because one compromise creates thousands of downstream victims.”
DockerDash Flaw in Docker AI Assistant Leads to RCE
— A critical-severity bug in Docker’s Ask Gordon AI assistant can be exploited to compromise Docker environments. Called DockerDash, the vulnerability exists in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Gateway’s contextual trust, where malicious instructions embedded into a Docker image’s metadata labels are forwarded to the MCP and executed without validation.</p>

<p>This is made possible because the MCP Gateway does not distinguish between informational metadata and runnable internal instructions. Furthermore, the AI assistant trusts all image metadata as safe contextual information and interprets commands in metadata as legitimate tasks. Noma Security named the technique meta-context injection. It was addressed by Docker with the release of version 4.50.0 in November 2025.</p>

<p>Microsoft Develops Scanner to Detect Hidden Backdoors in LLMs
— Microsoft has developed a scanner designed to detect backdoors in open-weight AI models in hopes of addressing a critical blind spot for enterprises that are dependent on third-party large language models (LLMs). The company said it identified three observable indicators that suggest the presence of backdoors in language models: a shift in how a model pays attention to a prompt when a hidden trigger is present, almost independently from the rest of the prompt; models tend to leak their own poisoned data, and partial versions of the backdoor can still trigger the intended response. “The scanner we developed first extracts memorized content from the model and then analyzes it to isolate salient substrings,” Microsoft noted. “Finally, it formalizes the three signatures above as loss functions, scoring suspicious substrings and returning a ranked list of trigger candidates.”

OpenClaw is Riddled With Security Concerns
— The skyrocketing popularity of OpenClaw (née Clawdbot and Moltbot) has attracted cybersecurity worries. With artificial intelligence (AI) agents having entrenched access to sensitive data, giving “bring-your-own-AI” systems privileged access to applications and the user conversations carries significant security risks.</p>

<p>The architectural concentration of power means AI agents are designed to store secrets and execute actions – features that are all essential to meet their objectives. But when they are misconfigured, the very design that serves as their backbone can collapse multiple security boundaries at once. Pillar Security has warned that attackers are actively scanning exposed OpenClaw gateways on port 18789. “The traffic included prompt injection attempts targeting the AI layer – but the more sophisticated attackers skipped the AI entirely,” researchers Ariel Fogel and Eilon Cohen
said
.</p>

<p>“They connected directly to the gateway’s WebSocket API and attempted authentication bypasses, protocol downgrades to pre-patch versions, and raw command execution.” Attack surface management firm Censys
said
it identified 21,639 exposed OpenClaw instances as of January 31, 2026. “Clawdbot represents the future of personal AI, but its security posture relies on an outdated model of endpoint trust,” said Hudson Rock. “Without encryption-at-rest or containerization, the ‘Local-First’ AI revolution risks becoming a goldmine for the global cybercrime economy.”
Prompt Injection Risks in MoltBook
— A
new analysis
of MoltBook posts has revealed several
critical risks
, including “506 prompt injection attacks targeting AI readers, sophisticated social engineering tactics exploiting agent psychology,” anti-human manifestos receiving hundreds of thousands of upvotes, and unregulated cryptocurrency activity comprising 19.3% of all content,” according to Simula Research Laboratory. British programmer Simon Willison, who coined the term prompt injection in 2022, has
described
Moltbook as the “most interesting place on the internet right now.” Vibe, coded by its creator, Matt Schlicht, Moltbook marks the first time AI agents built atop the OpenClaw platform can communicate with each other, post, comment, upvote, and create sub-communities without human intervention.</p>

<p>While Moltbook is pitched as a way to offload tedious tasks, equally apparent are the security pitfalls, given the deep access the AI agents have to personal information. Prompt injection attacks hidden in natural language text can instruct an AI agent to reveal private data. Malicious npm Packages Use EtherHiding Technique
— Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a set of 54 malicious npm packages targeting Windows systems that use an Ethereum smart contract as a dead drop resolver to fetch a command-and-control (C2) server to receive next-stage payloads. This technique, codename
EtherHiding
, is notable because it makes takedown efforts more difficult, allowing the operators to modify the infrastructure without making any changes to the malware itself.”The malware includes environment checks designed to evade sandbox detection, specifically targeting Windows systems with 5 or more CPUs,” Veracode
said
.</p>

<p>Other capabilities of the malware include system profiling, registry persistence via a COM hijacking technique, and a loader to execute the second-stage payload delivered by the C2. The C2 server is currently inactive, making it unclear what the exact motives are. Ukraine Rolls Out Verification for Starlink
— Ukraine has
rolled out
a verification system for Starlink satellite internet terminals used by civilians and the military after confirming that Russian forces have begun installing the technology on attack drones. The Ukrainian government has introduced a mandatory allowlist for Starlink terminals, as part of which only verified and registered devices will be allowed to operate in the country.</p>

<p>All other terminals will be automatically disconnected. Cellebrite Tech Used Against Jordanian Civil Society
— The Jordanian government used Cellebrite digital forensic software to extract data from phones belonging to at least seven Jordanian activists and human rights defenders between late 2023 and mid-2025, according to a
new report
published by the Citizen Lab. The extractions occurred while the activists were being interrogated or detained by authorities. Some of the recent victims were activists who organized protests in support of Palestinians in Gaza.</p>

<p>Citizen Lab said it uncovered iOS and Android indicators of compromise tied to Cellebrite in all four phones it forensically analyzed. It’s suspected that authorities have been using Cellebrite since at least 2020. ShadowHS, a Fileless Linux Post‑Exploitation Framework
— Threat hunters have discovered a stealthy Linux framework that runs entirely in memory for covert, post-exploitation control. The activity has been codenamed ShadowHS by Cyble.</p>

<p>“Unlike conventional Linux malware that emphasizes automated propagation or immediate monetization, this activity prioritizes stealth, operator safety, and long‑term interactive control over compromised systems,” the company
said
. “The loader decrypts and executes its payload exclusively in memory, leaving no persistent binary artifacts on disk. Once active, the payload exposes an interactive post‑exploitation environment that aggressively fingerprints host security controls, enumerates defensive tooling, and evaluates prior compromise before enabling higher‑risk actions.” The framework supports various dormant modules that support credential access, lateral movement, privilege escalation, cryptomining, memory inspection, and data exfiltration. Incognito Operator Gets 30 Years in Prison
— Rui-Siang Lin, 24, was sentenced to 30 years in U.S.</p>

<p>prison for his role as an administrator of Incognito Market, which facilitated millions of dollars’ worth of drug sales. Lin ran Incognito Market from January 2022 to March 2024 under the moniker “Pharaoh,” enabling the sale of more than $105 million of narcotics. Incognito Market allowed about 1,800 vendors to sell to a customer base exceeding 400,000 accounts. In all, the operation facilitated about 640,000 narcotics transactions.</p>

<p>Lin was
arrested
in May 2024, and he
pleaded guilty
to the charges later that December. “While Lin made millions, his offenses had devastating consequences,”
said
U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton. “He is responsible for at least one tragic death, and he exacerbated the opioid crisis and caused misery for more than 470,000 narcotics users and their families.”
INC Ransomware Group’s Slip-Up Proves Costly
— Cybersecurity firm Cyber Centaurs
said
it has helped a dozen victims
recover their data
after breaking into the backup server of the INC Ransomware group, where the stolen data was dumped.</p>

<p>The INC group started operations in 2023 and has listed more than 100 victims on its dark web leak site. “While INC Ransomware demonstrated careful planning, hands-on execution, and effective use of legitimate tools (LOTL), they also left behind infrastructure and artifacts that reflected reuse, assumption, and oversight,” the company said. “In this instance, those remnants, particularly related to Restic, created an opening that would not normally exist in a typical ransomware response.”
Xinbi Marketplace Accounts for $17.9B in Total Volume
— A new analysis from TRM Labs has revealed that the illicit Telegram-based guarantee marketplace known as
Xinbi
has continued to remain active, while those of its competitors, Haowang (aka HuiOne) Guarantee and Tudou Guarantee, dropped by 100% and 74%, respectively. Wallets associated with Xinbi have received approximately $8.9 billion and processed roughly $17.9 billion in total transaction volume.</p>

<p>Conclusion
The takeaway this week is simple: exposure is growing faster than visibility. Many risks aren’t coming from unknown threats, but from known systems being used in unexpected ways. Security teams are being forced to watch not just networks and endpoints, but ecosystems, integrations, and automated workflows. What matters now is readiness across layers — software, supply chains, AI tooling, infrastructure, and user platforms.</p>

<p>Attackers are operating across all of them at once, blending old techniques with new access paths. Staying secure is no longer about fixing one flaw at a time. It’s about understanding how every connected system can influence the next — and closing those gaps before they’re chained together. Found this article interesting?</p>

<h2 id="how-top-cisos-solve-burnout-and-speed-up-mttr-without-extra-hiring"><a id="article-5"></a>How Top CISOs Solve Burnout and Speed up MTTR without Extra Hiring</h2>

<p>Why do SOC teams keep burning out and missing SLAs even after spending big on security tools? Routine triage piles up, senior specialists get dragged into basic validation, and MTTR climbs, while stealthy threats still find room to slip through. Top CISOs have realized the solution isn’t hiring more people or stacking yet another tool onto the workflow, but giving their teams faster, clearer behavior evidence from the start. Here’s how they’re breaking the cycle and speeding up response without extra hiring.</p>

<p>Starting with Sandbox-First Investigation to Cut MTTR at the Source
The fastest way to reduce MTTR is to remove the delays baked into investigations. Static verdicts and fragmented workflows force analysts to guess, escalate, and re-check the same alerts, which drives burnout and slows containment. That’s why top CISOs are making
sandbox execution the first step
. With an interactive sandbox like
ANY.RUN
, teams can detonate suspicious files and links in an isolated environment and see real behavior immediately, so decisions happen early, not after hours of back-and-forth.</p>

Why CISOs prioritize sandbox-first workflows:
MTTR drops because clarity comes in minutes:
Runtime evidence replaces assumptions, so qualification and containment start faster. Fewer escalations, less senior time wasted:
Tier-1 validates alerts with behavior proof, driving up to a
30% reduction in Tier-1 → Tier-2 escalations
and keeping specialists focused on real incidents. Lower burnout through fewer manual steps:
Less “chasing context,” fewer repeats, more predictable workloads. Save up to
21 minutes per case
by making alert qualification evidence-driven, freeing senior time, reducing escalations, and lowering incident cost.</p>

<p>Reduce MTTR in your SOC
Automating Triage to Increase SOC Output and Protect SLAs
After early clarity comes scale. Even with strong visibility, SOCs slow down if every alert still demands manual effort. By automating triage, CISOs unlock measurable gains across response speed, workload balance, and SOC efficiency:
Faster investigations, faster containment:
Automated execution shortens the gap between alert and decision, directly reducing MTTR. Fewer errors under pressure:
Consistent handling of routine steps lowers risk during high-volume periods.</p>

<p>More impact from the same team:
Junior staff resolve more alerts independently, reducing escalation load on senior specialists. Better use of senior expertise:
Experts spend time on real incidents, not revalidating basic alerts. Higher SOC efficiency overall:
Less fatigue, fewer handoffs, and steadier SLA performance. In real phishing and malware campaigns, attackers often hide malicious behavior behind QR codes, redirect chains, or CAPTCHA gates.</p>

<p>Manually replaying these steps costs time and attention, exactly what SOC teams don’t have. Phishing attack with QR code exposed with the help of automation and interactivity, saving time and resources
With automated sandbox execution, those steps are handled instantly. Hidden URLs are opened, gating is passed, and malicious behavior is exposed within seconds, without waiting, retries, or workarounds. Malicious URL revealed inside ANY.RUN sandbox
Analysts can still step in live at any moment, inspect processes, or trigger additional actions, but they’re no longer burdened by repetitive setup work.</p>

<p>Giving the team this dual approach,
automation plus interactivity,
means the following for CISOs: faster response, lower workload, and more SOC capacity, without adding headcount. Automation not only speeds up investigations but also stabilizes the team behind them. Reducing Burnout by Removing Decision Fatigue
Burnout in the SOC isn’t caused by a lack of commitment. It’s caused by constant high-stakes decisions made with incomplete information.</p>

<p>When teams spend their shifts deciding whether alerts are “probably fine” or “worth escalating,” stress compounds quickly. Sandbox-first and automated triage workflows change that dynamic. Instead of guessing, teams work from
observable behavior. They get
structured outputs
they can act on immediately: behavior timelines, extracted IOCs, mapped TTPs, and clear, shareable reports that make handoffs fast and decisions defensible.</p>

<p>When time is tight, built-in AI assistance helps summarize what matters, so analysts spend less energy interpreting noise and more time closing cases. ANY.RUN’s auto-generated reports for fast and efficient sharing
For CISOs, the impact shows up in several ways:
More predictable workloads:
Investigations follow consistent paths instead of expanding unpredictably. Lower fatigue across shifts:
Less manual replay, fewer tool switches, and fewer stalled cases. Stronger team retention:
Teams stay engaged when work leads to confident outcomes, not constant uncertainty.</p>

<p>When decision fatigue drops, MTTR follows. The SOC becomes calmer, more focused, and easier to run, not because threats are simpler, but because the workflow is. What CISOs Are Reporting After Moving to Evidence-Based Response
After shifting to sandbox-first investigation, automated triage, and built-in collaboration, CISOs are using
ANY.RUN
report consistent improvements in how sustainably their SOCs operate. Across teams, leaders are seeing:
Up to 3× increase in SOC output:
More alerts handled with the same team, driven by faster qualification and fewer repeat steps.</p>

<p>MTTR reduced by up to 50%:
Early execution evidence shortens investigations and accelerates containment. Up to 30% fewer Tier-1 → Tier-2 escalations:
Clear behavior proof enables junior staff to resolve cases confidently. Higher detection rates for evasive threats:
90% of organizations report higher detection rates, particularly for stealthy and evasive threats. Lower burnout and steadier SLA performance:
Predictable workflows replace constant firefighting, easing pressure across shifts.</p>

<p>These numbers reflect real operational gains: faster response without extra hiring, better use of senior expertise, and a SOC that scales without exhausting the people running it. Build a Faster, More Sustainable SOC Without Extra Hiring
The best SOCs don’t wait. They respond fast, protect their teams from burnout, and stay steady even when alert volume spikes. But that only happens when the investigation workflow is built for speed and sustainability.</p>

<p>By making sandbox execution the first step, automating repetitive triage, and keeping investigation context shared and controlled, top CISOs are cutting MTTR without adding headcount. ANY.RUN
brings that foundation together in one place. It gives your team the visibility, automation, and enterprise-grade control needed to reduce delays, lower escalation pressure, and keep operations stable. Trusted by CISOs to deliver:
Faster MTTR through early behavior evidence
Lower risk of business disruption and costly incidents
Fewer unnecessary escalations and cleaner handoffs
Less burnout and better team retention
Stronger ROI from existing security investments

<h2 id="bloody-wolf-targets-uzbekistan-russia-using-netsupport-rat-in-spear-phishing-campaign"><a id="article-6"></a>Bloody Wolf Targets Uzbekistan, Russia Using NetSupport RAT in Spear-Phishing Campaign</h2>

<p>The threat actor known as
Bloody Wolf
has been linked to a campaign targeting Uzbekistan and Russia to infect systems with a remote access trojan known as
NetSupport RAT
. Cybersecurity vendor Kaspersky is tracking the activity under the moniker
Stan Ghouls
. The threat actor is known to be active since at least 2023, orchestrating spear-phishing attacks against manufacturing, finance, and IT sectors in Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. The campaign is estimated to have claimed about 50 victims in Uzbekistan, with 10 devices in Russia also impacted.</p>

<p>Other infections have been identified to a lesser degree in Kazakhstan, Turkey, Serbia, and Belarus. Infection attempts have also been recorded on devices within government organizations, logistics companies, medical facilities, and educational institutions. “Given Stan Ghouls’ targeting of financial institutions, we believe their primary motive is financial gain,” Kaspersky noted. “That said, their heavy use of RATs may also hint at cyber espionage.”
The misuse of NetSupport, a legitimate remote administration tool, is a departure for the threat actor, which previously leveraged STRRAT (aka Strigoi Master) in its attacks.</p>

<p>In November 2025, Group-IB
documented
phishing attacks aimed at entities in Kyrgyzstan to distribute the tool. The attack chains are fairly straightforward in that phishing emails loaded with malicious PDF attachments are used as a launchpad to trigger the infection. The PDF documents embed links that, when clicked, lead to the download of a malicious loader that handles multiple tasks -
Display a fake error message to give the impression to the victim that the application can’t run on their machine. Check if the number of previous RAT installation attempts is less than three.</p>

<p>If the number has reached or exceeded the limit, the loader throws an error message: “Attempt limit reached. Try another computer.”
Download the NetSupport RAT from one of the several external domains and launch it. Ensure NetSupport RAT’s persistence by configuring an autorun script in the Startup folder, adding a NetSupport launch script (“run.bat”) to the Registry’s autorun key, and creating a scheduled task to trigger the execution of the same batch script. Kaspersky said it also identified
Mirai botnet payloads
staged on infrastructure associated with Bloody Wolf, raising the possibility that the threat actor may have expanded its malware arsenal to target IoT devices.</p>

<p>“With over 60 targets hit, this is a remarkably high volume for a sophisticated targeted campaign,” the company concluded. “It points to the significant resources these actors are willing to pour into their operations.”
The disclosure coincides with a number of cyber campaigns targeting Russian organizations, including those conducted by
ExCobalt
, which has leveraged known security flaws and credentials stolen from contractors to obtain initial access to target networks. Positive Technologies
described
the adversary as one of the “most dangerous groups” attacking Russian entities. The attacks are characterized by the use of various tools, along with attempts to siphon Telegram credentials and message history from the compromised hosts and Outlook Web Access credentials by
injecting malicious code into the login page
-
CobInt
, a known backdoor used by the group.</p>

<p>Lockers such as Babuk and LockBit. PUMAKIT
, a
kernel rootkit
to escalate privileges, hide files and directories, and conceal itself from system tools, along with prior iterations known as Facefish (February 2021), Kitsune (February 2022), and Megatsune (November 2023). The use of Kitsune was also linked to a threat cluster known as
Sneaky Wolf
(aka Sneaking Leprechaun) by BI.ZONE. Octopus, a Rust-based toolkit that’s used to elevate privileges in a compromised Linux system.</p>

<p>“The group changed the tactics of initial access, shifting the focus of attention from the exploitation of 1-day vulnerabilities in corporate services available from the internet (e.g., Microsoft Exchange) to the penetration of the infrastructure of the main target through contractors,” Positive Technologies said. State institutions, scientific enterprises, and IT organizations in Russia have also been targeted by a previously unknown threat actor known as
Punishing Owl
that has resorted to stealing and leaking data on the dark web. The group, suspected to be a politically motivated hacktivist entity, has been active since December 2025, with one of its social media accounts administered from Kazakhstan. The attacks utilize phishing emails with a password-protected ZIP archive, which, when opened, contains a Windows shortcut (LNK) masquerading as a PDF document.</p>

<p>Opening the LNK file results in the execution of a PowerShell command to download a stealer named ZipWhisper from a remote server to harvest sensitive data and upload it to the same server. Another threat cluster that has trained its sights on Russia and Belarus is
Vortex Werewolf
. The end goal of the attacks is to deploy Tor and OpenSSH so as to facilitate persistent remote access. The campaign was previously exposed in November 2025 by Cyble and Seqrite Labs, with the latter calling the campaign
Operation SkyCloak

<h2 id="teampcp-worm-exploits-cloud-infrastructure-to-build-criminal-infrastructure"><a id="article-8"></a>TeamPCP Worm Exploits Cloud Infrastructure to Build Criminal Infrastructure</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have called attention to a “massive campaign” that has systematically targeted cloud native environments to set up malicious infrastructure for follow-on exploitation. The activity, observed around December 25, 2025, and described as “worm-driven,” leveraged exposed Docker APIs, Kubernetes clusters, Ray dashboards, and Redis servers, along with the recently disclosed
React2Shell
(CVE-2025-55182, CVSS score: 10.0) vulnerability. The campaign has been attributed to a threat cluster known as
TeamPCP
(aka DeadCatx3, PCPcat, PersyPCP, and ShellForce). TeamPCP is known to be active since at least November 2025, with the first instance of Telegram activity dating back to July 30, 2025.</p>

<p>The TeamPCP Telegram channel currently has over 700 members, where the group publishes stolen data from diverse victims across Canada, Serbia, South Korea, the U.A.E., and the U.S. Details of the threat actor were
first documented
by Beelzebub in December 2025 under the name Operation PCPcat. “The operation’s goals were to build a distributed proxy and scanning infrastructure at scale, then compromise servers to exfiltrate data, deploy ransomware, conduct extortion, and mine cryptocurrency,” Flare security researcher Assaf Morag
said
in a report published last week. TeamPCP is said to function as a cloud-native cybercrime platform, leveraging misconfigured Docker APIs, Kubernetes APIs, Ray dashboards, Redis servers, and vulnerable React/Next.js applications as main infection pathways to breach modern cloud infrastructure to facilitate data theft and extortion.</p>

<p>In addition, the compromised infrastructure is misused for a wide range of other purposes, ranging from cryptocurrency mining and data hosting to proxy and command-and-control (C2) relays. Rather than employing any novel tradecraft, TeamPCP leans on tried-and-tested attack techniques, such as existing tools, known vulnerabilities, and prevalent misconfigurations, to build an exploitation platform that automates and industrializes the whole process. This, in turn, transforms the exposed infrastructure into a “self-propagating criminal ecosystem,” Flare noted. Successful exploitation paves the way for the deployment of next-stage payloads from external servers, including shell- and Python-based scripts that seek out new targets for further expansion.</p>

<p>One of the core components is “proxy.sh,” which installs proxy, peer-to-peer (P2P), and tunneling utilities, and delivers various scanners to continuously search the internet for vulnerable and misconfigured servers. “Notably, proxy.sh performs environment fingerprinting at execution time,” Morag said. “Early in its runtime, it checks whether it is running inside a Kubernetes cluster.”
“If a Kubernetes environment is detected, the script branches into a separate execution path and drops a cluster-specific secondary payload, indicating that TeamPCP maintains distinct tooling and tradecraft for cloud-native targets rather than relying on generic Linux malware alone.”
A brief description of the other payloads is as follows -
scanner.py, which is designed to find misconfigured Docker APIs and Ray dashboards by downloading Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) lists from a GitHub account named “
DeadCatx3
,” while also featuring options to run a cryptocurrency miner (“mine.sh”). kube.py, which includes Kubernetes-specific functionality to conduct cluster credential harvesting and API-based discovery of resources such as pods and namespaces, followed by dropping “proxy.sh” into accessible pods for broader propagation and setting up a persistent backdoor by deploying a privileged pod on every node that mounts the host.</p>

<p>react.py, which is designed to exploit the React flaw (CVE-2025-29927) to achieve remote command execution at scale. pcpcat.py, which is designed to discover exposed Docker APIs and Ray dashboards across large IP address ranges and automatically deploy a malicious container or job that executes a Base64-encoded payload. Flare said the C2 server node located at 67.217.57[.]240 has also been linked to the operation of
Sliver
, an open-source C2 framework that’s known to be abused by threat actors for post-exploitation purposes. Data from the cybersecurity company shows that the threat actors mainly single out Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure environments.</p>

<p>The attacks are assessed to be opportunistic in nature, primarily targeting infrastructure that supports its goals rather than going after specific industries. The result is that organizations that run such infrastructure become “collateral victims” in the process. “The PCPcat campaign demonstrates a full lifecycle of scanning, exploitation, persistence, tunneling, data theft, and monetization built specifically for modern cloud infrastructure,” Morag said. “What makes TeamPCP dangerous is not technical novelty, but their operational integration and scale.</p>

<p>Deeper analysis shows that most of their exploits and malware are based on well-known vulnerabilities and lightly modified open-source tools.”
“At the same time, TeamPCP blends infrastructure exploitation with data theft and extortion. Leaked CV databases, identity records, and corporate data are published through ShellForce to fuel ransomware, fraud, and cybercrime reputation building. This hybrid model allows the group to monetize both compute and information, giving it multiple revenue streams and resilience against takedowns.”

<h2 id="beyondtrust-fixes-critical-pre-auth-rce-vulnerability-in-remote-support-and-pra"><a id="article-9"></a>BeyondTrust Fixes Critical Pre-Auth RCE Vulnerability in Remote Support and PRA</h2>

<p>BeyondTrust has released updates to address a critical security flaw impacting Remote Support (RS) and Privileged Remote Access (PRA) products that, if successfully exploited, could result in remote code execution. “BeyondTrust Remote Support (RS) and certain older versions of Privileged Remote Access (PRA) contain a critical pre-authentication remote code execution vulnerability,” the company
said
in an advisory released February 6, 2026. “By sending specially crafted requests, an unauthenticated remote attacker may be able to execute operating system commands in the context of the site user.”
The vulnerability, categorized as an
operating system command injection
, has been assigned the CVE identifier
CVE-2026-1731
. It’s rated 9.9 on the CVSS scoring system.</p>

<p>BeyondTrust said successful exploitation of the shortcoming could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute operating system commands in the context of the site user, resulting in unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and service disruption. The issue affects the following versions -
Remote Support versions 25.3.1 and prior
Privileged Remote Access versions 24.3.4 and prior
It has been patched in the following versions -
Remote Support - Patch BT26-02-RS, 25.3.2 and later
Privileged Remote Access - Patch BT26-02-PRA, 25.1.1 and later
The company is also urging self-hosted customers of Remote Support and Privileged Remote Access to manually apply the patch if their instance is not subscribed to automatic updates. Those running a Remote Support version older than 21.3 or on Privileged Remote Access older than 22.1 are also required to upgrade to a newer version to apply this patch. “Self-hosted customers of PRA may also upgrade to 25.1.1 or a newer version to remediate this vulnerability,” it added.</p>

<p>According to security researcher and Hacktron AI co-founder Harsh Jaiswal, the vulnerability was discovered on January 31, 2026, through an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled variant analysis, adding that it found about 11,000 instances exposed to the internet. Additional details of the flaw have been withheld to give users time to apply the patches. “About ~8,500 of those are on-prem deployments, which remain potentially vulnerable if patches aren’t applied,” Jaiswal and Mohan Sri Rama Krishna Pedhapati
said
. With security flaws in BeyondTrust Privileged Remote Access and Remote Support having
come under
active exploitation
in the past, it’s essential that users update to the latest version as soon as possible for optimal protection.</p>

<h2 id="openclaw-integrates-virustotal-scanning-to-detect-malicious-clawhub-skills"><a id="article-10"></a>OpenClaw Integrates VirusTotal Scanning to Detect Malicious ClawHub Skills</h2>

<p>OpenClaw (formerly Moltbot and Clawdbot) has
announced
that it’s partnering with Google-owned VirusTotal to scan skills that are being uploaded to ClawHub, its skill marketplace, as part of broader efforts to bolster the security of the agentic ecosystem. “All skills published to ClawHub are now scanned using VirusTotal’s threat intelligence, including their new Code Insight capability,” OpenClaw’s founder Peter Steinberger, along with Jamieson O’Reilly and Bernardo Quintero said. “This provides an additional layer of security for the OpenClaw community.”
The process essentially entails creating a unique SHA-256 hash for every skill and cross checking it against VirusTotal’s database for a match. If it’s not found, the skill bundle is uploaded to the malware scanning tool for further analysis using
VirusTotal Code Insight
.</p>

<p>Skills that have a “benign” Code Insight verdict are automatically approved by ClawHub, while those marked suspicious are flagged with a warning. Any skill that’s deemed malicious is blocked from download. OpenClaw also said all active skills are re-scanned on a daily basis to detect scenarios where a previously clean skill becomes malicious. That said, OpenClaw maintainers also cautioned that VirusTotal scanning is “not a silver bullet” and that there is a possibility that some malicious skills that use a cleverly concealed prompt injection payload may slip through the cracks.</p>

<p>In addition to the VirusTotal partnership, the platform is
expected
to publish a comprehensive threat model, public security roadmap, formal security reporting process, as well as details about the security audit of its entire codebase. The development comes in the aftermath of
reports
that found
hundreds
of
malicious skills
on
ClawHub
, prompting OpenClaw to add a reporting option that allows signed-in users to flag a suspicious skill. Multiple analyses have uncovered that these skills masquerade as legitimate tools, but, under the hood, they harbor malicious functionality to exfiltrate data, inject backdoors for remote access, or install stealer malware. “AI agents with system access can become covert data-leak channels that bypass traditional data loss prevention, proxies, and endpoint monitoring,” Cisco noted last week.</p>

<p>“Second, models can also become an execution orchestrator, wherein the prompt itself becomes the instruction and is difficult to catch using traditional security tooling.”
The discovery of malicious skills aside, the recent viral popularity of OpenClaw, the open-source agentic artificial intelligence (AI) assistant, and
Moltbook
, an adjacent social network where autonomous AI agents built atop OpenClaw interact with each other in a Reddit-style platform, has
raised security concerns
broadly known as the Lethal Trifecta. While OpenClaw functions as an automation engine to trigger workflows, interact with online services, and operate across devices, the entrenched access given to skills, coupled with the fact that they can process data from untrusted sources, can open the door to risks like malware and prompt injection. In other words, the integrations, while convenient, significantly broaden the attack surface and expand the set of untrusted inputs the agent consumes, turning it into an “
agentic trojan horse
“ for data exfiltration and other malicious actions. Backslash Security has
described
OpenClaw as an “AI With Hands.”
“Unlike traditional software that does exactly what code tells it to do, AI agents interpret natural language and make decisions about actions,” OpenClaw noted.</p>

<p>“They blur the boundary between user intent and machine execution. They can be manipulated through language itself.”
OpenClaw also acknowledged that the power wielded by skills – which are used to extend the capabilities of an AI agent, such as controlling smart home devices to managing finances – can be abused by bad actors, who can leverage the agent’s access to tools and data to exfiltrate sensitive information, execute unauthorized commands, send messages on the victim’s behalf, and even download and run additional payloads without their knowledge or consent. What’s more, with OpenClaw being increasingly deployed on employee endpoints without formal IT or security approval, the elevated privileges of these agents can further enable shell access, data movement, and network connectivity outside standard security controls, creating a new class of
Shadow AI risk
for enterprises. “OpenClaw and tools like it will show up in your organization whether you approve them or not,” Astrix Security researcher Tomer Yahalom
said
.</p>

<p>“Employees will install them because they’re genuinely useful. The only question is whether you’ll know about it.”
Some of the other glaring security issues that have come to the fore in recent days are below -
A
now-fixed issue
identified in earlier versions that could cause proxied traffic to be misclassified as local, bypassing authentication for some internet-exposed instances. “OpenClaw stores credentials in cleartext, uses insecure coding patterns including direct eval with user input, and has no privacy policy or clear accountability,” OX Security’s Moshe Siman Tov Bustan and Nir Zadok
said
. “Common uninstall methods leave sensitive data behind – and fully revoking access is far harder than most users realize.”
A
zero-click attack
that abuses OpenClaw’s integrations to plant a backdoor on a victim’s endpoint for persistent control when a seemingly harmless document is processed by the AI agent, resulting in the execution of an indirect prompt injection payload that allows it to respond to messages from an attacker-controlled Telegram bot.</p>

<p>An
indirect prompt injection
embedded in a web page, which, when parsed as part of an innocuous prompt asking the large language model (LLM) to summarize the page’s contents, causes OpenClaw to append an attacker-controlled set of instructions to the ~/.openclaw/workspace/HEARTBEAT.md file and silently await further commands from an external server. A
security analysis of 3,984 skills
on the ClawHub marketplace has found that 283 skills, about 7.1% of the entire registry, contain critical security flaws that expose sensitive credentials in plaintext through the LLM’s context window and output logs. A report from Bitdefender has
revealed
that malicious skills are often cloned and re-published at scale using small name variations, and that payloads are staged through paste services such as glot.io and public GitHub repositories. A now-patched
one-click remote code execution vulnerability
affecting OpenClaw that could have allowed an attacker to
trick a user into visiting a malicious web page
that could cause the Gateway Control UI to leak the OpenClaw authentication token over a WebSocket channel and subsequently use it to execute arbitrary commands on the host.</p>

<p>OpenClaw’s gateway
binds to 0.0.0.0:18789 by default
, exposing the full API to any network interface. Per
data from Censys
, there are over
30,000 exposed instances
accessible over the internet as of February 8, 2026, although most require a token value in order to view and interact with them. In a
hypothetical attack scenario
, a prompt injection payload embedded within a specifically crafted WhatsApp message can be used to exfiltrate “.env” and “creds.json” files, which store credentials, API keys, and session tokens for connected messaging platforms from an exposed OpenClaw instance. A
misconfigured Supabase database
belonging to Moltbook that was left exposed in client-side JavaScript, making secret API keys of every agent registered on the site freely accessible, and allowing full read and write access to platform data.</p>

<p>According to Wiz
, the exposure included 1.5 million API authentication tokens, 35,000 email addresses, and private messages between agents. Threat actors have been found exploiting Moltbook’s platform mechanics to amplify reach and funnel other agents toward malicious threads that contain prompt injections to manipulate their behavior and extract sensitive data or steal cryptocurrency. “Moltbook may have inadvertently also created a laboratory in which agents, which can be high-value targets, are constantly processing and engaging with untrusted data, and in which guardrails aren’t set into the platform – all by design,” Zenity Labs
said
. “The first, and perhaps most egregious, issue is that OpenClaw relies on the configured language model for many security-critical decisions,” HiddenLayer researchers Conor McCauley, Kasimir Schulz, Ryan Tracey, and Jason Martin noted.</p>

<p>“Unless the user proactively enables OpenClaw’s
Docker-based tool sandboxing
feature, full system-wide access remains the default.”
Among other architectural and design problems identified by the AI security company are OpenClaw’s failure to filter out untrusted content containing control sequences, ineffective guardrails against indirect prompt injections, modifiable memories and system prompts that persist into future chat sessions, plaintext storage of API keys and session tokens, and no explicit user approval before executing tool calls. In a report published last week, Persmiso Security argued that the security of the OpenClaw ecosystem is much more crucial than app stores and browser extension marketplaces owing to the agents’ extensive access to user data. “AI agents get credentials to your entire digital life,” security researcher Ian Ahl
pointed out
. “And unlike browser extensions that run in a sandbox with some level of isolation, these agents operate with the full privileges you grant them.”
“The skills marketplace compounds this.</p>

<p>When you install a malicious browser extension, you’re compromising one system. When you install a malicious agent skill, you’re potentially compromising every system that agent has credentials for.”
The long list of security issues associated with OpenClaw has prompted China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology to issue an alert about misconfigured instances, urging users to implement protections to secure against cyber attacks and data breaches, Reuters
reported
. “When agent platforms go viral faster than security practices mature, misconfiguration becomes the primary attack surface,” Ensar Seker, CISO at SOCRadar, told The Hacker News via email. “The risk isn’t the agent itself; it’s exposing autonomous tooling to public networks without hardened identity, access control, and execution boundaries.”
“What’s notable here is that the Chinese regulator is explicitly calling out configuration risk rather than banning the technology.</p>

<p>That aligns with what defenders already know: agent frameworks amplify both productivity and blast radius. A single exposed endpoint or overly permissive plugin can turn an AI agent into an unintentional automation layer for attackers.”

<h2 id="german-agencies-warn-of-signal-phishing-targeting-politicians-military-journalists"><a id="article-11"></a>German Agencies Warn of Signal Phishing Targeting Politicians, Military, Journalists</h2>

<p>Germany’s Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (aka Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz or BfV) and Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) have issued a joint advisory warning of a malicious cyber campaign undertaken by a likely state-sponsored threat actor that involves carrying out phishing attacks over the Signal messaging app. “The focus is on high-ranking targets in politics, the military, and diplomacy, as well as investigative journalists in Germany and Europe,” the agencies
said
. “Unauthorized access to messenger accounts not only allows access to confidential private communications but also potentially compromises entire networks.”
A noteworthy aspect of the campaign is that it does not involve the distribution of malware or the exploitation of any security vulnerability in the privacy-focused messaging platform. Rather, the end goal is to weaponize its legitimate features to obtain covert access to a victim’s chats, along with their contact lists.</p>

<p>The attack chain is as follows: the threat actors masquerade as “Signal Support” or a support chatbot named “Signal Security ChatBot” to initiate direct contact with prospective targets, urging them to provide a
PIN
or verification code received via SMS, or risk facing data loss. Should the victim comply, the attackers can register the account and gain access to the victim’s profile, settings, contacts, and block list through a device and mobile phone number under their control. While the stolen PIN does not enable access to the victim’s past conversations, a threat actor can use it to capture incoming messages and send messages posing as the victim. That target user, who has by now lost access to their account, is then instructed by the threat actor disguised as the support chatbot to register for a new account.</p>

<p>There also exists an alternative infection sequence that takes advantage of the
device linking option
to trick victims into scanning a QR code, thereby granting the attackers access to the victim’s account, including their messages for the last 45 days, on a device managed by them. In this case, however, the targeted individuals continue to have access to their account, little realizing that their chats and contact lists are now also exposed to the threat actors. The security authorities warned that while the current focus of the campaign appears to be Signal, the attack can also be extended to WhatsApp since it also incorporates similar
device linking
and PIN features as part of
two-step verification
. “Successful access to messenger accounts not only allows confidential individual communications to be viewed, but also potentially compromises entire networks via group chats,” BfV and BSI said.</p>

<p>While it’s not known who is behind the activity, similar attacks have been orchestrated by multiple Russia-aligned threat clusters tracked as
Star Blizzard
,
UNC5792 (aka UAC-0195), and UNC4221 (aka UAC-0185)
, per reports from Microsoft and Google Threat Intelligence Group early last year. In December 2025, Gen Digital also
detailed
another campaign codenamed GhostPairing, where cybercriminals have resorted to the device linking feature on WhatsApp to seize control of accounts to likely impersonate users or commit fraud. To stay protected against the threat, users are advised to refrain from engaging with support accounts and entering their Signal PIN as a text message. A crucial line of defense is to enable Registration Lock, which prevents unauthorized users from registering a phone number on another device.</p>

<p>It’s also advised to periodically review the list of linked devices and remove any unknown devices. The development comes as the
Norwegian government
accused the Chinese-backed hacking groups, including
Salt Typhoon
, of breaking into several organizations in the country by exploiting vulnerable network devices, while also calling out Russia for closely monitoring military targets and allied activities, and Iran for keeping tabs on dissidents. Stating that Chinese intelligence services attempt to recruit Norwegian nationals to gain access to classified data, the Norwegian Police Security Service (PST) noted that these sources are then encouraged to establish their own “human source” networks by advertising part-time positions on job boards or approaching them via LinkedIn. The agency further warned that China is “systematically” exploiting collaborative research and development efforts to strengthen its own security and intelligence capabilities.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that
Chinese law
requires software vulnerabilities identified by Chinese researchers to be reported to the authorities no later than two days after discovery. “Iranian cyber threat actors compromise email accounts, social media profiles, and private computers belonging to dissidents to collect information about them and their networks,” PST
said
. “These actors have advanced capabilities and will continue to develop their methods to conduct increasingly targeted and intrusive operations against individuals in Norway.”
The disclosures also follow an advisory from CERT Polska, which assessed that a Russian nation-state hacking group called
Static Tundra
is likely behind coordinated cyber attacks targeted at more than 30 wind and photovoltaic farms, a private company from the manufacturing sector, and a large combined heat and power plant (CHP) supplying heat to almost half a million customers in the country. “In each affected facility, a FortiGate device was present, serving as both a VPN concentrator and a firewall,” it said.</p>

<p>“In every case, the VPN interface was exposed to the internet and allowed authentication to accounts defined in the configuration without multi‑factor authentication.”

<h2 id="china-linked-dknife-aitm-framework-targets-routers-for-traffic-hijacking-malware-delivery"><a id="article-12"></a>China-Linked DKnife AitM Framework Targets Routers for Traffic Hijacking, Malware Delivery</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have taken the wraps off a gateway-monitoring and adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) framework dubbed
DKnife
that’s operated by China-nexus threat actors since at least 2019. The framework comprises seven Linux-based implants that are designed to perform deep packet inspection, manipulate traffic, and deliver malware via routers and edge devices. Its primary targets seem to be Chinese-speaking users, an assessment based on the presence of credential harvesting phishing pages for Chinese email services, exfiltration modules for popular Chinese mobile applications like WeChat, and code references to Chinese media domains. “DKnife’s attacks target a wide range of devices, including PCs, mobile devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices,” Cisco Talos researcher Ashley Shen
noted
in a Thursday report.</p>

<p>“It delivers and interacts with the
ShadowPad
and
DarkNimbus
backdoors by hijacking binary downloads and Android application updates.”
The cybersecurity company said it discovered DKnife as part of its ongoing monitoring of another Chinese threat activity cluster codenamed Earth Minotaur that’s linked to tools like the
MOONSHINE exploit kit and the DarkNimbus (aka DarkNights) backdoor
. Interestingly, the backdoor has also been put to use by a third China-aligned advanced persistent threat (APT) group called TheWizards. An analysis of DKnife’s infrastructure has uncovered an IP address hosting WizardNet, a Windows implant deployed by
TheWizards
via an AitM framework referred to as Spellbinder. Details of the toolkit were documented by ESET in April 2025.</p>

<p>The targeting of Chinese-speaking users, Cisco said, hinges on the discovery of configuration files obtained from a single command-and-control (C2) server, raising the possibility that there could be other servers hosting similar configurations for different regional targeting. This is significant in light of infrastructural connections between DKnife and WizardNet, as TheWizards is known to target individuals and the gambling sector across Cambodia, Hong Kong, Mainland China, the Philippines, and the United Arab Emirates. Functions of seven DKnife components
Unlike WizardNet, DKnife is engineered to be run on Linux-based devices. Its modular architecture enables operators to serve a wide range of functions, ranging from packet analysis to traffic manipulation.</p>

<p>Delivered by means of an ELF downloader, it contains seven different components -
dknife.bin - The central nervous system of the framework responsible for deep packet inspection, user activities reporting, binary download hijacking, and DNS hijacking
postapi.bin - A data reporter module that acts as a relay by receiving traffic from DKnife and reporting to remote C2
sslmm.bin - A reverse proxy module modified from HAProxy that performs TLS termination, email decryption, and URL rerouting
mmdown.bin - An updater module that connects to a hard-coded C2 server to download APKs used for the attack
yitiji.bin - A packet forwarder module that creates a
bridged TAP interface
on the router to host and route attacker-injected LAN traffic
remote.bin - A peer-to-peer (P2P) VPN client module that creates a communication channel to remote C2
dkupdate.bin - An updater and watchdog module that keeps the various components alive
“DKnife can harvest credentials from a major Chinese email provider and host phishing pages for other services,” Talos said. “For harvesting email credentials, the sslmm.bin component presents its own TLS certificate to clients, terminates and decrypts POP3/IMAP connections, and inspects the plaintext stream to extract usernames and passwords.”
“Extracted credentials are tagged with ‘PASSWORD,’ forwarded to the postapi.bin component, and ultimately relayed to remote C2 servers.”
The core component of the framework is “dknife.bin,” which takes care of deep packet inspection, allowing operators to conduct traffic monitoring campaigns ranging from “covert monitoring of user activity to active in-line attacks that replace legitimate downloads with malicious payloads.” This includes -
Serving updated C2 to Android and Windows variants of DarkNimbus malware
Conducting Domain Name System (DNS)-based hijacking over IPv4 and IPv6 to facilitate malicious redirects for JD.com-related domains
Hijacking and replacing Android application updates associated with Chinese news media, video streaming, image editing apps, e-commerce platforms, taxi-service platforms, gaming, and pornography video streaming apps by intercepting their update manifest requests
Hijacking Windows and other binary downloads based on certain pre-configured rules to deliver via DLL side-loading the
ShadowPad
backdoor, which then loads DarkNimbus
Interfering with communications from antivirus and PC-management products, including 360 Total Security and Tencent services
Monitoring user activity in real-time and reporting it back to the C2 server by grouping them into broad categories, such as messaging (including voice/video calls, sent texts, received images, in-app article views on Signal and WeChat), shopping, news consumption, map searches, video streaming, gaming, dating, taxi and rideshare requests, and email checking. “Routers and edge devices
remain prime targets
in sophisticated targeted attack campaigns,” Talos said. “As threat actors intensify their efforts to compromise this infrastructure, understanding the tools and TTPs they employ is critical.</p>

<p>The discovery of the DKnife framework highlights the advanced capabilities of modern AitM threats, which blend deep‑packet inspection, traffic manipulation, and customized malware delivery across a wide range of device types.”

<h2 id="cisa-orders-removal-of-unsupported-edge-devices-to-reduce-federal-network-risk"><a id="article-13"></a>CISA Orders Removal of Unsupported Edge Devices to Reduce Federal Network Risk</h2>

<p>The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has
ordered
Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to strengthen asset lifecycle management for edge network devices and remove those that no longer receive security updates from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) over the next 12 to 18 months. The agency said the move is to drive down technical debt and minimize the risk of compromise, as state-sponsored threat actors turn such devices as a preferred access pathway for breaking into target networks. Edge devices is an umbrella term that encompasses load balancers, firewalls, routers, switches, wireless access points, network security appliances, Internet of Things (IoT) edge devices, software-defined networks, and other physical or virtual networking components that route network traffic and hold privileged access.</p>

<p>“Persistent cyber threat actors are increasingly exploiting unsupported edge devices – hardware and software that no longer receive vendor updates to firmware or other security patches,” CISA said. “Positioned at the network perimeter, these devices are especially vulnerable to persistent cyber threat actors exploiting a new or known vulnerability.”
To assist FCEB agencies in this regard, CISA said it has developed an end-of-support edge device list that acts as a preliminary repository with information about devices that have already reached end-of-support or are expected to lose support. This list will include the product name, version number, and end-of-support date. The newly issued
Binding Operational Directive 26-02, Mitigating Risk From End-of-Support Edge Devices
, requires FCEB agencies to undertake the following actions -
Update each vendor-supported-edge device running end-of-support software to a vendor-supported software version
(With immediate effect)
Catalog all devices to identify those that are end-of-support and report to CISA
(Within three months)
Decommission all edge devices that  are end-of-support and listed in the edge device list from agency networks and replace them with vendor-supported devices that can receive security updates
(Within 12 months)
Decommission all other identified edge devices from agency networks and replace with vendor-supported devices that can receive security updates
(Within 18 months)
Establish a lifecycle management process to enable continuous discovery of all edge devices and maintain an inventory of those that are/will reach  end-of-support
(Within 24 months)
“Unsupported devices pose a serious risk to federal systems and should never remain on enterprise networks,” said CISA Acting Director Madhu Gottumukkala.</p>

<p>“By proactively managing asset lifecycles and removing end-of-support technology, we can collectively strengthen resilience and protect the global digital ecosystem.”

<h2 id="asian-state-backed-group-tgr-sta-1030-breaches-70-government-infrastructure-entities"><a id="article-14"></a>Asian State-Backed Group TGR-STA-1030 Breaches 70 Government, Infrastructure Entities</h2>

<p>A previously undocumented cyber espionage group operating from Asia broke into the networks of at least 70 government and critical infrastructure organizations across 37 countries over the past year, according to
new findings
from Palo Alto Networks Unit 42. In addition, the hacking crew has been observed conducting active reconnaissance against government infrastructure associated with 155 countries between November and December 2025. Some of the entities that have been successfully compromised include five national-level law enforcement/border control entities, three ministries of finance and other government ministries, and departments that align with economic, trade, natural resources, and diplomatic functions. The activity is being tracked by the cybersecurity company under the
moniker
TGR-STA-1030
, where “TGR” stands for temporary threat group and “STA” refers to state-backed motivation.</p>

<p>Evidence shows that the threat actor has been active since January 2024. While the hackers’ country of origin remains unclear, they are assessed to be of Asian origin, given the use of regional tooling and services, language setting preferences, targeting that’s consistent with events and intelligence of interest to the region, and its GMT+8 operating hours. Pete Renals, director of National Security Programs for Unit 42 at Palo Alto Networks, told The Hacker News over email that “the threat actor successfully accessed and exfiltrated sensitive data from victim email servers.” The siphoned information included financial negotiations and contracts, banking and account information, and critical military-related operational updates. Attack chains have been found to leverage phishing emails as a starting point to trick recipients into clicking on a link pointing to New Zealand-based file hosting service MEGA.</p>

<p>The link hosts a
ZIP archive
that contains an executable dubbed Diaoyu Loader and a zero-byte file named “pic1.png.”
“The malware employs a dual-stage execution guardrail to thwart automated sandbox analysis,” Unit 42 said. “Beyond the hardware requirement of a horizontal screen resolution greater than or equal to 1440, the sample performs an environmental dependency check for a specific file (pic1.png) in its execution directory.”
The PNG image acts as a file-based integrity check that causes the malware artifact to terminate before unleashing its nefarious behavior in the event it’s not present in the same location. It’s only after this condition is satisfied that the malware checks for the presence of specific cybersecurity programs from Avira (“SentryEye.exe”), Bitdefender (“EPSecurityService.exe”), Kaspersky (“Avp.exe”), Sentinel One (“SentinelUI.exe”), and Symantec (“NortonSecurity.exe”). Countries targeted by TGR-STA-1030 reconnaissance between November and December 2025
It’s currently not known why the threat actors have opted to look for only a narrow selection of products.</p>

<p>The end goal of the loader is to download three images (“admin-bar-sprite.png,” “Linux.jpg,” and “Windows.jpg”) from a GitHub repository named “WordPress,” which serve as a conduit for the deployment of a Cobalt Strike payload. The associated GitHub account (“github[.]com/padeqav”) is no longer available. TGR-STA-1030 has also been observed attempting to exploit various kinds of N-day vulnerabilities impacting a large number of software products from Microsoft, SAP, Atlassian, Ruijieyi Networks, Commvault, and Eyou Email System to gain initial access to target networks. There is no evidence indicating the group has developed or leveraged any zero-day exploit in their attacks.</p>

<p>Among the tools put to use by the threat actor are command-and-control (C2) frameworks, web shells, and tunneling utilities -
C2 frameworks -
Cobalt Strike
,
VShell
,
Havoc
,
Sliver
, and
SparkRAT
Web shells -
Behinder
,
neo-reGeorg
, and
Godzilla
Tunnelers - GO Simple Tunnel (GOST), Fast Reverse Proxy Server (FRPS), and IOX
It’s worth noting that the use of the aforementioned web shells is frequently linked to Chinese hacking groups. Another tool of note is a Linux kernel rootkit codenamed ShadowGuard that utilizes the Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) technology to conceal process information details, intercept critical system calls to hide specific processes from user-space analysis tools like ps, and conceal directories and files named “swsecret.”
“The group routinely leases and configures its C2 servers on infrastructure owned by a variety of legitimate and commonly known VPS providers,” Unit 42 said. “To connect to the C2 infrastructure, the group leases additional VPS infrastructure that it uses to relay traffic through.”
The cybersecurity vendor said the adversary managed to maintain access to several of the impacted entities for months, indicating efforts to collect intelligence over extended periods of time. “TGR-STA-1030 remains an active threat to government and critical infrastructure worldwide.</p>

<p>The group primarily targets government ministries and departments for espionage purposes,” it concluded. “We assess that it prioritizes efforts against countries that have established or are exploring certain economic partnerships.”
“While this group might be pursuing espionage objectives, its methods, targets, and scale of operations are alarming, with potential long-term consequences for national security and key services.”
