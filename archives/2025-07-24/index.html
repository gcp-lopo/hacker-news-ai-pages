<h2 id="threat-actor-mimo-targets-magento-and-docker-to-deploy-crypto-miners-and-proxyware"><a id="article-1"></a>Threat Actor Mimo Targets Magento and Docker to Deploy Crypto Miners and Proxyware</h2>

<p>The threat actor behind the exploitation of vulnerable Craft Content Management System (CMS) instances has shifted its tactics to target Magento CMS and misconfigured Docker instances. The activity has been attributed to a threat actor tracked as
Mimo
(aka Hezb), which has a long history of leveraging N-day security flaws in various web applications to deploy cryptocurrency miners. “Although Mimo’s primary motivation remains financial, through cryptocurrency mining and bandwidth monetization, the sophistication of their recent operations suggests potential preparation for more lucrative criminal activities,” Datadog Security Labs
said
in a report published this week. Mimo’s exploitation of CVE-2025-32432, a critical security flaw in Craft CMS, for cryptojacking and proxyjacking was
documented
by Sekoia in May 2025.</p>

<p>Newly observed attack chains associated with the threat actor involve the abuse of undetermined PHP-FPM vulnerabilities in Magento e-commerce installations to obtain initial access, and then using it to drop
GSocket
, a legitimate open-source penetration testing tool, to
establish persistent access
to the host by means of a reverse shell. “The initial access vector is PHP-FPM command injection via a Magento CMS plugin, indicating that Mimo possesses multiple exploit capabilities beyond previously observed adversarial tradecraft,” researchers Ryan Simon, Greg Foss, and Matt Muir said. In an attempt to sidestep detection, the GSocket binary masquerades as a legitimate or kernel-managed thread so that it blends in with other processes that may be running on the system. Another notable technique employed by the attackers is the use of in-memory payloads using
memfd_create()
so as to launch an ELF binary loader called “4l4md4r” without leaving any trace on disk.</p>

<p>The loader is then responsible for deploying the IPRoyal proxyware and the XMRig miner on the compromised machine but not before modifying the “/etc/ld.so.preload” file to inject a rootkit to conceal the presence of these artifacts. The distribution of a miner and
proxyware
underscores a two-pronged approach adopted by Mimo to maximize financial gain. The distinct revenue generation streams ensure that compromised machines’ CPU resources are hijacked to mine cryptocurrency, while the victims’ unused internet bandwidth is monetized for illicit residential proxy services. “Furthermore, the use of proxyware, which typically consumes minimal CPU, enables stealthy operation that prevents detection of the additional monetization even if the crypto miner’s resource usage is throttled,” the researchers said.</p>

<p>“This multi-layered monetization also enhances resilience: even if the crypto miner is detected and removed, the proxy component may remain unnoticed, ensuring continued revenue for the threat actor.”
Datadog said it also observed the threat actors abusing misconfigured Docker instances that are publicly accessible to spawn a new container, within which a malicious command is executed to fetch an additional payload from an external server and execute it. Written in Go, the modular malware comes fitted with capabilities to achieve persistence, conduct file system I/O operations, terminate processes, perform in-memory execution. It also serves as a dropper for GSocket and IPRoyal, and attempts to propagate to other systems via SSH brute-force attacks. “This demonstrates the threat actor’s willingness to compromise a diverse range of services – not just CMS providers – to achieve their objectives,” Datadog said.</p>

<h2 id="new-coyote-malware-variant-exploits-windows-ui-automation-to-steal-banking-credentials"><a id="article-2"></a>New Coyote Malware Variant Exploits Windows UI Automation to Steal Banking Credentials</h2>

<p>The Windows banking trojan known as
Coyote
has become the first known malware strain to exploit the Windows accessibility framework called
UI Automation
(UIA) to harvest sensitive information. “The new Coyote variant is targeting Brazilian users, and uses UIA to extract credentials linked to 75 banking institutes’ web addresses and cryptocurrency exchanges,” Akamai security researcher Tomer Peled
said
in an analysis. Coyote, first revealed by Kaspersky in 2024, is
known
for targeting Brazilian users. It comes with capabilities to log keystrokes, capture screenshots, and serve overlays on top of login pages associated with financial enterprises.</p>

<p>Part of the Microsoft .NET Framework, UIA is a legitimate feature offered by Microsoft to allow screen readers and other assistive technology products to programmatically access user interface (UI) elements on a desktop. That UIA can be a potential pathway for abuse, including data theft, was previously
demonstrated
as a proof-of-concept (PoC) by Akamai in December 2024, with the web infrastructure company noting that it could be used to steal credentials or execute code. In some ways, Coyote’s latest modus operandi mirrors the various
Android banking trojans
that have been spotted in the wild, which often weaponize the operating system’s accessibility services to obtain valuable data. Akamai’s analysis found that the malware invokes the GetForegroundWindow() Windows API in order to extract the active window’s title and compare it against a hard-coded list of web addresses belonging to targeted banks and cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>

<p>“If no match is found Coyote will then use UIA to parse through the UI child elements of the window in an attempt to identify browser tabs or address bars,” Peled explained. “The content of these UI elements will then be cross-referenced with the same list of addresses from the first comparison.”
As many as 75 different financial institutions are targeted by the latest version of the malware, up from 73
documented
by Fortinet FortiGuard Labs earlier this January. “Without UIA, parsing the sub-elements of another application is a nontrivial task,” Akamai added. “To be able to effectively read the contents of sub-elements within another application, a developer would need to have a very good understanding of how the specific target application is structured.”
“Coyote can perform checks, regardless of whether the malware is online or operating in an offline mode.</p>

<p>This increases the chances of successfully identifying a victim’s bank or crypto exchange and stealing their credentials.”

<h2 id="kerberoasting-detections-a-new-approach-to-a-decade-old-challenge"><a id="article-3"></a>Kerberoasting Detections: A New Approach to a Decade-Old Challenge</h2>

<p>Security experts have been talking about
Kerberoasting
for over a decade, yet this attack continues to evade typical defense methods. Why? It’s because existing detections rely on brittle heuristics and static rules, which don’t hold up for detecting potential attack patterns in highly variable Kerberos traffic. They frequently generate false positives or miss “low-and-slow” attacks altogether.</p>

<p>Is there a better and more accurate way for modern organizations to detect subtle anomalies within irregular Kerberos traffic? The BeyondTrust research team
sought to answer this question by combining security research insights with advanced statistics. This article offers a high-level look into the driving forces behind our research and our process of developing and testing a new statistical framework for improving Kerberos anomaly detection accuracy and reducing false positives. An Introduction to Kerberoasting Attacks
Kerberoasting attacks take advantage of the Kerberos network authentication protocol within Windows Active Directory environments.</p>

<p>The Kerberos authentication process works as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>AS-REQ:
A user logs in and requests a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT). 2. AS-REP:
The Authentication Server verifies the user’s credentials and issues a TGT.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>TGS-REQ:
When the user wants to request access to a service, they request a Ticket Granting Service Ticket (TGS) using the previously received TGT. This action is recorded as Windows Event 4769
[1]
on the domain controller. 4.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>TGS-REP:
The TGS verifies the request and issues a TGS, which is encrypted using the password hash of the service account associated with the requested service. 5. KRB-AP-REQ:
For the user to authenticate against a service using the TGS ticket, they send it to the application server, which then takes various actions to verify the user’s legitimacy and allow access to the requested service. Attackers aim to exploit this process because Kerberos service tickets are encrypted with the hash of the service account’s password.</p>

<p>To take advantage of Kerberos tickets, attackers first leverage LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) to query the directory for any AD accounts that have Service Principal Names (SPNs) associated with them. An attacker will then request Ticket Granting Service (TGS) tickets for these accounts, which can be done without any administrative rights. Once they have requested these service tickets, they can crack the hash offline to uncover the credentials of the service account. Access to a service account can then enable the attacker to move laterally, escalate privileges, or exfiltrate data.</p>

<p>The Shortcomings of Typical Heuristic Methods
Many organizations have heuristic-based detection methods in place to flag irregular Kerberos behavior. One common method is volume-based detection, which can flag a spike in TGS request activity from a single account. If an attacker requests TGS tickets for all service principal names they can find using LDAP, this detection method will likely identify this spike as suspicious activity. Another method, encryption-type analysis, can detect if an attacker attempts to downgrade the encryption of the requested TGS tickets from the default AES to a weaker type, such as RC4 or DES, in hopes of making their own job easier when they start to
crack the hash
.</p>

<p>While both of these static rule-based methods can work in some cases, they produce a notorious number of false positives. Additionally, they don’t factor in the user’s behaviors and irregularities unique to each organization’s domain configurations. A Statistical Model for Detecting Kerberoasting Attacks
With these limitations in mind, the BeyondTrust research team sought to find a method that would both improve anomaly detection capabilities and reduce false positives. We found statistical modeling to be the best method, in which a model would be created that could estimate probability distribution based on contextual data patterns.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>The ability to predict normal user behavior would be key to flagging any abnormalities. Our team laid out four constraints for our prospective statistical model, based on existing Kerberoasting research</dt>
  <dt>[2, 3]</dt>
  <dt>:</dt>
  <dt>Explainability</dt>
  <dd>The ability to interpret the output with respect to a recognized, normalized, and easy to explain and track measure. Uncertainty</dd>
  <dd>The ability to reflect sample size and confidence in estimates, as opposed to the output being a simple binary indicator. Scalability</dd>
  <dd>The ability to limit the amount of cloud computing and data storage needed for updating model parameters per run.</dd>
  <dt>Nonstationarity</dt>
  <dd>The capacity to adapt to trends or other data changes over time, and incorporating these shifts into how anomalies are defined
The BeyondTrust research team worked to build out a model that aligned with the above constraints, eventually developing a model that groups similar ticket-request patterns into distinct clusters and then uses histogram bins to track the frequency of certain activity levels over time. The goal</dd>
  <dd>to learn what ‘normal’ looks like for each cluster. We aimed to reduce false positives by grouping these like data patterns together, as events that could look suspicious in isolation would become normal when compared to similar data patterns. Kerberoasting Statistical Model: Results
The team then tested the model across 50 days of data or roughly 1,200 hourly evaluation periods.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The model’s results are as follows:
Consistently achieved processing times under 30 seconds, including histogram updates, clustering operations, score calculations, percentile ranking, and result storage. Identified six anomalies with notable temporal patterns, such as uncorrelated spikes in narrow time windows, increased variance, and significant temporary shifts. Two were identified as penetration tests, one was the team’s simulated Kerberoasting attack, and three were related to large changes in Active Directory infrastructure that caused inadvertent spikes in Kerberos service ticket requests. Handled extreme variability in heavy-tailed accounts exceptionally well, appropriately down-weighting anomaly scores after observing just two consecutive spikes through dynamic sliding window updates and real-time percentile ranking.</p>

<p>This level of adaptability is notably faster than standard anomaly detection methods
After conducting this research, the BeyondTrust research team was able to report early success by combining security expertise with advanced statistical techniques. Because there are inherent limitations of pure anomaly detection methodologies, collaboration between experts in security and data science was necessary for this success. While statisticians can create an adaptive model that takes variable behaviors into consideration, security researchers can offer needed context for identifying notable features within flagged events. Conclusion
Altogether, this research proves that, even when considering decade-old attack patterns like Kerberoasting, there are clear paths forward in iterating and evolving on detection and response capabilities.</p>

<p>Alongside considering the possibilities of novel detection capabilities, such as the ones described in this research, teams should also evaluate proactive identity security measures that reduce Kerberoasting risks before they ever occur. Some solutions with
identity threat detection and respon
se (ITDR) capabilities, such as
BeyondTrust Identity Security Insights
, can help teams proactively identify accounts that are vulnerable to Kerberoasting due to improper use of service principals and the use of weak ciphers. Precise, proactive measures, combined with smarter, more context-aware detection models, are essential as security teams continuously work to cut through noise and stay ahead of growing complexity and scale.

<h2 id="google-launches-oss-rebuild-to-expose-malicious-code-in-widely-used-open-source-packages"><a id="article-5"></a>Google Launches OSS Rebuild to Expose Malicious Code in Widely Used Open-Source Packages</h2>

<p>Google has announced the launch of a new initiative called
OSS Rebuild
to bolster the security of the open-source package ecosystems and prevent software supply chain attacks. “As supply chain attacks continue to target widely-used dependencies, OSS Rebuild gives security teams powerful data to avoid compromise without burden on upstream maintainers,” Matthew Suozzo, Google Open Source Security Team (GOSST),
said
in a blog post this week. The project aims to provide build provenance for packages across the Python Package Index (Python), npm (JS/TS), and Crates.io (Rust) package registries, with plans to extend it to other open-source software development platforms. With OSS Rebuild, the idea is to leverage a combination of declarative build definitions, build instrumentation, and network monitoring capabilities to produce trustworthy security metadata, which can then be used to validate the package’s origin and ensure it has not been tampered with.</p>

<p>“Through automation and heuristics, we determine a prospective build definition for a target package and rebuild it,” Google said. “We semantically compare the result with the existing upstream artifact, normalizing each one to remove instabilities that cause bit-for-bit comparisons to fail (e.g., archive compression).”
Once the package is reproduced, the build definition and outcome is published via
SLSA Provenance
as an attestation mechanism that allows users to reliably verify its origin, repeat the build process, and even customize the build from a known-functional baseline. In scenarios where automation isn’t able to fully reproduce the package, OSS Rebuild offers a manual build specification that can be used instead. OSS Rebuild, the tech giant noted, can help detect different categories of supply chain compromises, including -
Published packages that contain code not present in the public source repository (e.g.,
@solana/web3.js
)
Suspicious build activity (e.g.,
tj-actions/changed-files
)
Unusual execution paths or suspicious operations embedded within a package that are challenging to identify through manual review (e.g.,
XZ Utils
)
Besides securing the software supply chain, the solution can improve Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs), speed up vulnerability response, strengthen package trust, and eliminate the need for CI/CD platforms to be in charge of an organization’s package security.</p>

<p>“Rebuilds are derived by analyzing the published metadata and artifacts and are evaluated against the upstream package versions,” Google
said
. “When successful, build attestations are published for the upstream artifacts, verifying the integrity of the upstream artifact and eliminating many possible sources of compromise.”

<h2 id="cisa-orders-urgent-patching-after-chinese-hackers-exploit-sharepoint-flaws-in-live-attacks"><a id="article-6"></a>CISA Orders Urgent Patching After Chinese Hackers Exploit SharePoint Flaws in Live Attacks</h2>

<p>The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), on July 22, 2025,
added
two Microsoft SharePoint flaws, CVE-2025-49704 and CVE-2025-49706, to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (
KEV
) catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. To that end, Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies are required to remediate identified vulnerabilities by July 23, 2025. “CISA is aware of active exploitation of a spoofing and RCE vulnerability chain involving CVE-2025-49706 and CVE-2025-49704, enabling unauthorized access to on-premise SharePoint servers,” the agency
said
in an updated advisory.</p>

<p>The inclusion of the two shortcomings, a spoofing vulnerability and a remote code execution vulnerability collectively tracked as ToolShell, to the KEV catalog comes after Microsoft
revealed
that Chinese hacking groups like Linen Typhoon and Violet Typhoon leveraged these flaws to breach on-premises SharePoint servers since July 7, 2025. As of writing, the tech giant’s own advisories only list CVE-2025-53770 as being exploited in the wild. What’s more, it describes the four flaws as below -
CVE-2025-49704 – SharePoint Remote Code Execution
CVE-2025-49706 – SharePoint Post-auth Remote Code Execution
CVE-2025-53770 – SharePoint ToolShell Authentication Bypass and Remote Code Execution
CVE-2025-53771 – SharePoint ToolShell Path Traversal
The fact that CVE-2025-53770 is both an authentication bypass and a remote code execution bug indicates that CVE-2025-53771 is not necessary to build the exploit chain. CVE-2025-53770 and CVE-2025-53771 are assessed to be patch bypasses for CVE-2025-49704 and CVE-2025-49706, respectively.</p>

<p>“The root cause [of CVE-2025-53770] is a combination of two bugs: An authentication bypass (CVE-2025-49706) and an insecure deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2025-49704),” the Akamai Security Intelligence Group
said
. The attack chains observed so far entail the exploitation of SharePoint flaws to deploy a web shell that allows the threat actors to retrieve and steal MachineKey data. Symantec said it also identified post-exploitation activity in which adversaries ran an encoded PowerShell command to download a file named “client.exe” from an external server and save it locally as “debug.js.”
“The executable was likely renamed as debug.js in order to make it look benign and avoid raising suspicions,” the Broadcom-owned company
said
, adding the binary is then used to run a Windows batch script that captures system information and cryptographic secrets. When reached for comment regarding the exploitation status of CVE-2025-53771 and other flaws, a Microsoft spokesperson told The Hacker News that the information published in its advisories is correct “at the time of original publication” and that it does not typically update post-release.</p>

<p>“Microsoft also assists CISA with the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog which provides regularly updated information on exploited vulnerabilities,” the spokesperson added. The development comes as watchTowr Labs told the publication that it has internally devised a method exploiting CVE-2025-53770 such that it bypasses Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI), a mitigation step outlined by Microsoft to prevent unauthenticated attacks. “This has allowed us to continue identifying vulnerable systems even after mitigations like AMSI have been applied,” watchTowr CEO Benjamin Harris said. “AMSI was never a silver bullet, and this outcome was inevitable.</p>

<p>But we’re concerned to hear that some organizations are choosing to ‘enable AMSI’ instead of patching. This is a very bad idea.”
“Now that exploitation has been linked to nation-state actors, it would be naive to think they could leverage a SharePoint zero-day but somehow not bypass AMSI. Organizations must patch. Should go without saying – all the public PoCs will trigger AMSI, and mislead organizations into believing the mitigations are comprehensive/the host is no longer vulnerable.</p>

<p>This would be incorrect.”
Update
When contacted for comment, CISA said it’s still early in the incident response, adding it’s continually assessing the scope and impact associated with the SharePoint Server flaws. “CISA continues to work in lockstep with Microsoft, as well as federal and other partners, to address and mitigate the active exploitation of multiple vulnerabilities impacting Microsoft on-site SharePoint servers,” said Acting Executive Assistant Director for Cybersecurity, Chris Butera, in a statement shared with The Hacker News. The agency also said it’s aware of federal agencies and State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial (SLTT) partners affected by the activity, and that it’s working with them to assess the scope and mitigate the risk as appropriate. According to latest estimates, about 400 government agencies, corporations, and other entities
have been compromised
.</p>

<p>(The story was updated after publication to include a response from CISA.)

<p>The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
added
two security flaws impacting SysAid IT support software to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (
KEV
) catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. The vulnerabilities in question are listed below -
CVE-2025-2775
(CVSS score: 9.3) - An improper restriction of XML external entity (XXE) reference vulnerability in the Checkin processing functionality, allowing for administrator account takeover and file read primitives
CVE-2025-2776
(CVSS score: 9.3) - An improper restriction of XML external entity (XXE) reference vulnerability in the Server URL processing functionality, allowing for administrator account takeover and file read primitives
Both shortcomings were
disclosed
by watchTowr Labs researchers Sina Kheirkhah and Jake Knott back in May, alongside
CVE-2025-2777
(CVSS score: 9.3), a pre-authenticated XXE within the /lshw endpoint. The three vulnerabilities were addressed by SysAid in the on-premise version 24.4.60 build 16 released in early March 2025.</p>

<p>The cybersecurity firm noted that the vulnerabilities could allow attackers to inject unsafe XML entities into the web application, resulting in a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack, and in some cases, remote code execution when chained with
CVE-2024-36394
, a command injection flaw revealed by CyberArk last June. It’s currently not known how CVE-2025-2775 and CVE-2025-2776 are being exploited in real-world attacks. Nor is any information available regarding the identity of the threat actors, their end goals, or the scale of these efforts. To safeguard against the active threat, Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies are required to apply the necessary fixes by August 12, 2025.</p>

<h2 id="microsoft-links-ongoing-sharepoint-exploits-to-three-chinese-hacker-groups"><a id="article-8"></a>Microsoft Links Ongoing SharePoint Exploits to Three Chinese Hacker Groups</h2>

<p>Microsoft has formally tied the exploitation of security flaws in internet-facing SharePoint Server instances to two Chinese hacking groups called Linen Typhoon and Violet Typhoon
as early as July 7, 2025
, corroborating earlier reports. The tech giant said it also observed a third China-based threat actor, which it tracks as Storm-2603, weaponizing the flaws as well to obtain initial access to target organizations. “With the rapid adoption of these exploits, Microsoft assesses with high confidence that threat actors will continue to integrate them into their attacks against unpatched on-premises SharePoint systems,” the tech giant
said
in a report published today. A brief description of the threat activity clusters is below -
Linen Typhoon
(aka
APT27
, Bronze Union, Emissary Panda, Iodine, Lucky Mouse, Red Phoenix, and UNC215), which is active since 2012 and has been previously attributed to malware families like SysUpdate, HyperBro, and PlugX
Violet Typhoon
(aka APT31, Bronze Vinewood, Judgement Panda, Red Keres, and Zirconium), which is active since 2015 and has been previously attributed attacks targeting the United States, Finland, and Czechia
Storm-2603
, a suspected China-based threat actor that has deployed Warlock and LockBit ransomware in the past
The vulnerabilities, which affect on-premises SharePoint servers, have been found to leverage incomplete fixes for CVE-2025-49706, a spoofing flaw, and CVE-2025-49704, a remote code execution bug.</p>

<p>The bypasses have been assigned the CVE identifiers CVE-2025-53771 and CVE-2025-53770, respectively. In the attacks observed by Microsoft, the threat actors have been found exploiting on-premises SharePoint servers through a POST request to the ToolPane endpoint, resulting in an authentication bypass and remote code execution. As disclosed by other cybersecurity vendors, the infection chains pave the way for the deployment of a web shell named “spinstall0.aspx” (aka spinstall.aspx, spinstall1.aspx, or spinstall2.aspx) that allows the adversaries to retrieve and steal MachineKey data. Cybersecurity researcher Rakesh Krishnan said “three distinct Microsoft Edge invocations were identified” during forensic analysis of a SharePoint exploit.</p>

<p>This includes Network Utility Process, Crashpad Handler, and GPU Process. “Each serves a unique function within Chromium’s architecture, yet collectively reveals a strategy of behavioral mimicry and sandbox evasion,” Krishnan
noted
, while also calling attention to the web shell’s use of Google’s Client Update Protocol (
CUP
) to “blend malicious traffic with benign update checks.”
To mitigate the risk posed by the threat, it’s essential that users apply the latest update for SharePoint Server Subscription Edition, SharePoint Server 2019, and SharePoint Server 2016, rotate SharePoint server ASP.NET machine keys, restart Internet Information Services (IIS), and deploy Microsoft Defender for Endpoint or equivalent solutions. It’s also recommended to integrate and enable Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) and Microsoft Defender Antivirus (or similar solutions) for all on-premises SharePoint deployments and configure AMSI to enable Full Mode. “Additional actors may use these exploits to target unpatched on-premises SharePoint systems, further emphasizing the need for organizations to implement mitigations and security updates immediately,” Microsoft said.</p>

<p>While the confirmation from Microsoft is the latest hacking campaign linked to China, it is also the second time Beijing-aligned threat actors have targeted the Windows maker. In March 2021, the adversarial collective tracked as Silk Typhoon (aka Hafnium) was tied to a
mass-exploitation activity
that leveraged multiple then-zero-days in Exchange Server. Earlier this month, a 33-year-old Chinese national, Xu Zewei, was
arrested
in Italy and charged with carrying out cyber attacks against American organizations and government agencies by weaponizing the Microsoft Exchange Server flaws, which came to be known as ProxyLogon. Found this article interesting?</p>

<h2 id="cisco-confirms-active-exploits-targeting-ise-flaws-enabling-unauthenticated-root-access"><a id="article-9"></a>Cisco Confirms Active Exploits Targeting ISE Flaws Enabling Unauthenticated Root Access</h2>

<p>Cisco on Monday updated its advisory of a set of recently disclosed security flaws in Identity Services Engine (ISE) and ISE Passive Identity Connector (ISE-PIC) to acknowledge active exploitation. “In July 2025, the Cisco PSIRT [Product Security Incident Response Team], became aware of attempted exploitation of some of these vulnerabilities in the wild,” the company
said
in an alert. The network equipment vendor did not disclose which vulnerabilities have been weaponized in real-world attacks, the identity of the threat actors exploiting them, or the scale of the activity. Cisco ISE plays a central role in network access control, managing which users and devices are allowed onto corporate networks and under what conditions.</p>

<p>A compromise at this layer could give attackers unrestricted access to internal systems, bypassing authentication controls and logging mechanisms—turning a policy engine into an open door. The vulnerabilities outlined in the alert are all critical-rated bugs (CVSS scores: 10.0) that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to issue commands on the underlying operating system as the root user -
CVE-2025-20281
and
CVE-2025-20337</p>
<ul>
  <li>Multiple vulnerabilities in a specific API that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system as root
CVE-2025-20282</li>
  <li>A vulnerability in an internal API that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to upload arbitrary files to an affected device and then execute those files on the underlying operating system as root
While the first two flaws are the result of insufficient validation of user-supplied input, the latter stems from a lack of file validation checks that would prevent uploaded files from being placed in privileged directories on an affected system. As a result, an attacker could leverage these shortcomings by submitting a crafted API request (for CVE-2025-20281 and CVE-2025-20337) or uploading a crafted file to the affected device (for CVE-2025-20282). In light of active exploitation, it’s essential that customers upgrade to a fixed software release as soon as possible to remediate these vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>These flaws are exploitable remotely without authentication, placing unpatched systems at high risk of pre-auth remote code execution—a top-tier concern for defenders managing critical infrastructure or compliance-driven environments. Security teams should also review system logs for suspicious API activity or unauthorized file uploads, especially in externally exposed deployments. Found this article interesting? Follow us on

<h2 id="credential-theft-and-remote-access-surge-as-allakore-purerat-and-hijack-loader-proliferate"><a id="article-10"></a>Credential Theft and Remote Access Surge as AllaKore, PureRAT, and Hijack Loader Proliferate</h2>

<p>Mexican organizations are still being targeted by threat actors to deliver a modified version of AllaKore RAT and SystemBC as part of a long-running campaign. The activity has been attributed by Arctic Wolf Labs to a financially motivated hacking group called
Greedy Sponge
. It’s believed to be active since early 2021, indiscriminately targeting a wide range of sectors, such as retail, agriculture, public sector, entertainment, manufacturing, transportation, commercial services, capital goods, and banking. “The AllaKore RAT payload has been heavily modified to enable the threat actors to send select banking credentials and unique authentication information back to their command-and-control (C2) server, for the purpose of conducting financial fraud,” the cybersecurity company
said
in an analysis published last week.</p>

<p>Details of the campaign were
first documented
by the BlackBerry Research and Intelligence Team (which is now part of Arctic Wolf) in January 2024, with the attacks employing phishing or drive-by compromises to distribute booby-trapped ZIP archives that ultimately facilitate the deployment of AllaKore RAT. Attack chains analyzed by Arctic Wolf show that the remote access trojan is designed to optionally deliver secondary payloads like
SystemBC
, a
C-based malware
that turns compromised Windows hosts into
SOCKS5 proxies
to allow attackers to communicate with their C2 servers. Besides dropping potent proxy tools, Greedy Sponge has also refined and updated its tradecraft to incorporate improved geofencing measures as of mid-2024 in an attempt to thwart analysis. “Historically, geofencing to the Mexican region took place in the first stage, via a .NET downloader included in the trojanized Microsoft software installer (MSI) file,” the company said.</p>

<p>“This has now been moved server-side to restrict access to the final payload.”
The latest iteration sticks to the same approach as before, distributing ZIP files (“Actualiza_Policy_v01.zip”) containing a legitimate Chrome proxy executable and a trojanized MSI file that’s engineered to drop
AllaKore RAT
, a malware with capabilities for keylogging, screenshot capture, file download/upload, and remote control. The MSI file is configured to deploy a .NET downloader, which is responsible for retrieving and launching the remote access trojan from an external server (“manzisuape[.]com/amw”), and a PowerShell script for cleanup actions. This is not the first time AllaKore RAT has been used in attacks targeting Latin America. In May 2024, HarfangLab and Cisco Talos
revealed
that an AllaKore variant known as AllaSenha (aka CarnavalHeist) has been used to single out Brazilian banking institutions by threat actors from the country.</p>

<p>“Having spent those four years-plus actively targeting Mexican entities, we would deem this threat actor persistent, but not particularly advanced,” Arctic Wolf said. “The strictly financial motivation of this actor coupled with their limited geographic targeting is highly distinctive.”
“Additionally, their operational longevity points to probable operational success – meaning they’ve found something that works for them, and they are sticking with it. Greedy Sponge has held the same infrastructure models for the duration of their campaigns.”
Attack Flow of Campaign Using Ghost Crypt
The development comes as eSentire detailed a May 2025 phishing campaign that employed a new
crypter-as-a-service
offering known as Ghost Crypt to deliver and run
PureRAT
. “Initial access was gained through social engineering, where the threat actor impersonated a new client and sent a PDF containing a link to a Zoho WorkDrive folder containing malicious zip files,” the Canadian company
noted
.</p>

<p>“The attacker also created a sense of urgency by calling the victim and requesting that they extract and execute the file immediately.”
Further examination of the attack chain has revealed that the malicious file contains a DLL payload that’s encrypted with Ghost Crypt, which then extracts and injects the trojan (i.e., the DLL) into a legitimate Windows csc.exe process using a technique called
process hypnosis injection
. Ghost Crypt, which was first advertised by an eponymous threat actor on cybercrime forums on April 15, 2025, offers the ability to bypass Microsoft Defender Antivirus, and serve several stealers, loaders, and trojans like Lumma, Rhadmanthys, StealC, BlueLoader, PureLoader, DCRat, and XWorm, among others. The discovery also follows the
emergence
of a new version of
Neptune RAT
(aka MasonRAT) that’s distributed via JavaScript file lures, allowing the threat actors to extract sensitive data, take screenshots, log keystrokes, drop
clipper malware
, and download additional DLL payloads. Neptune RAT, according to Gen Digital, shares striking overlaps with another remote access trojan referred to as XWorm, suggesting that the first iteration of the malware is a derivative of the latter.</p>

<p>Neptune RAT V2, in contrast, incorporates significant changes from its predecessor, alluding to a rewrite or an extensive refactoring. “Both XWorm and Neptune RAT V1 use the exact same encryption routine: The mutex is hashed using MD5, and the hash is duplicated to form a 32-byte key used for AES encryption running in the insecure ECB mode,” security researcher Ajin Deepak
said
. “Both XWorm and Neptune RAT share a similar approach to initialization: they load all configuration settings at the start of their respective main functions and then launch executor threads to carry out their tasks.”
In recent months, cyber attacks have employed malicious Inno Setup installers that serve as a conduit for
Hijack Loader
(aka IDAT Loader), which then delivers the RedLine information stealer. The attack “leverages Inno Setup’s Pascal scripting capabilities to retrieve and execute the next-stage payload in a compromised or targeted host,” the Splunk Threat Research Team
said
.</p>

<p>“This technique closely resembles the approach used by a well-known malicious Inno Setup loader called
D3F@ck Loader
, which follows a similar infection pattern.”

<h2 id="how-to-advance-from-soc-manager-to-ciso"><a id="article-11"></a>How to Advance from SOC Manager to CISO?</h2>

<p>Making the move from managing a security operations center (SOC) to being a chief information security officer (CISO) is a significant career leap. Not only do you need a solid foundation of tech knowledge but also leadership skills and business smarts. This article will guide you through the practical steps and skills you’ll need to nab an executive cybersecurity job and make the promotion from SOC manager to CISO a reality. Is the CISO role right for you?</p>

<p>It’s always a good idea to think about how you could move up and grow in your career. Aspiring to be a CISO can be a great career move. Additionally, certain operational tasks in cybersecurity, especially in a SOC, are becoming increasingly automated, making it vital to develop strategic and leadership skills to stay ahead. Having ambitious goals helps you, as a SOC analyst or lead, stay relevant and valuable in what is a constantly changing field.</p>

<p>However, the role of CISO is significantly different from other roles in cybersecurity and comes with its own set of challenges. So, while it is a good option, it’s not the only path and might not suit everyone’s strengths and career goals. It’s my hope that this article will lay out what being a CISO is all about so you can determine if it’s the path you want to take. Key skills for executive growth
For those looking to take on executive and leadership roles like CISO, it’s essential to develop skills beyond the scope of your typical IT role.</p>

<p>Having a comprehensive IT background is a significant advantage, especially when it comes to security vulnerabilities and how to respond to incidents. But you can’t focus solely on technical expertise at the expense of vital leadership, communication, and strategic thinking skills needed for the position of CISO. Remember: You’ll have to relay complex security matters to stakeholders outside IT, and do so in a way that they can easily understand the issues at stake. Let’s break down areas you’ll need for the role of executive.</p>

<p>Strategic thinking
Strategic thinking demands a firm grip on the organization’s core operations, particularly how it generates revenue and its key value streams. This perspective allows security professionals to align their efforts with business objectives, rather than operating in isolation. Business acumen
This is related to strategic thinking but emphasizes knowledge of risk management and finance. Security leaders must factor in financial impacts to justify security investments and manage risks effectively.</p>

<p>Balancing security measures with user experience and system availability is another critical aspect. If security policies are too strict, productivity can suffer; if they’re too permissive, the company can be exposed to threats. Decisions must consider the impact of security actions on the broader business environment. Communication
Effective communication is vital for translating technical details into language senior stakeholders can grasp and act upon.</p>

<p>This means avoiding jargon and abbreviations to convey information in a simplistic manner that resonates with multiple stakeholders, including executives who may not have a deep technical background. Communicating the impact of security initiatives in clear, concise language ensures decisions are well-informed and support company goals. Service management
You will have to ensure technical services meet business requirements, particularly in managing service delivery, implementing change, and resolving issues. All of this is essential for a secure and efficient IT infrastructure.</p>

<p>Knowledge of risk management as mentioned above, is fundamental in identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks. It helps align security strategies with business goals, facilitating informed decisions and resource allocation. Compliance
Being aware of compliance requirements, involving adherence to regulatory and industry standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, NIS2, PCI DSS), is critical for ensuring legal and ethical operations. Understanding these mandates helps in implementing appropriate security controls and policies.</p>

<p>Exposure to legal aspects, such as data privacy laws and intellectual property rights, broadens the perspective necessary for the CISO role and interactions with both external and internal bodies such as the
GRC
within your organization. Here, formal education, including a degree in computer science or cybersecurity, combined with continuous learning via industry courses and certifications, strengthens your expertise; it also prepares you for leadership responsibilities and demonstrates your readiness to take on the challenges that come with the job. Practical advice for career transition
To successfully transition and advance your cybersecurity career, you’ll need to take concrete strategic steps toward a CISO role. Gaining visibility, building influence, and getting promoted
To advance your cybersecurity career, make your value known.</p>

<p>Share your contributions and accomplishments, both within your team and also with other departments and leadership. When presenting data, make it actionable by showing how the information drives improvements and supports business goals via tactical metrics and simple language. Also, actively look for opportunities to contribute to broader initiatives and offer solutions to challenges that extend beyond your current role and responsibilities. To set yourself apart as someone ready for a promotion to the executive level, take initiative and demonstrate a willingness to lead.</p>

<p>Avoiding common pitfalls
One common mistake is to communicate based on your or another person’s assumptions. Always verify information, and remember, opinions are not facts. Another pitfall is believing your angle or viewpoint is the only correct one. Other perspectives exist and hold value.</p>

<p>As much as possible, embrace a collaborative approach, focused on building consensus and defining the right direction rather than prioritizing speed. This means engaging in open discussions, listening to feedback, and working towards a shared understanding. This will yield a stronger foundation for initiatives and avoid potential disagreements or misinterpretations down the road. What exactly does being a CISO entail?</p>

<p>To succeed at the executive level, you need to be aware of the nuances of the CISO job, expectations depending on your company’s structure, and the different roles you’ll have to fulfill before being entrusted with the title of CISO. Who does your CISO report to? The reporting structure of a chief information security officer varies widely across organizations. Often, the CISO reports to the chief information officer (CIO).</p>

<p>In this structure, security is seen as a subset of IT, focusing on the technical aspects of protecting data and systems. However, as cybersecurity risks become more business-critical, CISOs are increasingly reporting to the chief financial officer (CFO) or the chief risk officer (CRO). Reporting to the CFO emphasizes the financial impact of security breaches and the need for risk-based security investments. But if you’re reporting to the CRO, you’ll need to highlight the enterprise-wide risk management perspective, ensuring security is integrated into broader organizational risk strategies.</p>

<p>The reporting line significantly influences the CISO’s priorities and scope of authority, reflecting a company’s overall security maturity and approach to risk. It’s a good idea to consider your own company’s structure and how it aligns with your career goals and potential advancement. What changes at the top: Roles &amp; expectations
Transitioning from a technical lead to an executive role like CISO entails a complete shift in expectations. As a technical lead, the focus is primarily on hands-on implementation, troubleshooting, and technical problem-solving.</p>

<p>At the executive level, the emphasis shifts to strategy, leadership, and business alignment. CISOs are expected to develop and execute a comprehensive security strategy that protects the organization’s assets while enabling business operations. This is where decision-making becomes more strategic, requiring CISOs to balance risk mitigation with business objectives. They must also effectively communicate technical risks to senior management in terms of their business impact.</p>

<p>This covers everything from budgeting and policy development to regulatory compliance and security team management. Key roles &amp; responsibilities above technical lead
Advancement from technical lead to CISO involves several intermediate roles; each one has distinct responsibilities and demands a higher level of leadership, strategic thinking, and business savvy. A
SOC manager
oversees the daily operations of the security operations center. That means making sure incident detection and response are efficient and effective.</p>

<p>Responsibilities here include managing staff, developing processes, and reporting on metrics. A
director of security
typically has a broader scope, handling multiple security functions like network security, application security, and vulnerability management. Directors develop security programs, manage budgets, and ensure compliance with regulations. The
CISO
is the top security executive, responsible for the overall security strategy and posture of the organization.</p>

<p>They align security with business goals, manage risk, and communicate with executive leadership. Becoming a CISO is a progressive journey of developing skills and taking on broader responsibilities. Summary and key takeaways
The journey from a SOC analyst or manager to CISO is a significant undertaking. You’re not just becoming a better expert but evolving into a leader who can align security with business objectives.</p>

<p>Embracing a leadership mindset involves more than just managing tasks. You need to inspire teams, influence stakeholders, and drive strategic decisions. All of this takes communication skills, strategic thinking, and business acumen to manage risks effectively and communicate complex technical information in simple terms. Be proactive in seeking visibility and influence within your organization and avoid common pitfalls like making assumptions and prioritizing speed over consensus.</p>

<p>Finally, understand the reporting structure and evolving expectations of a CISO. By setting long-term goals and embracing a leadership mindset, you can successfully navigate the transition to a CISO and thrive in what is both a challenging and rewarding role. Adaptive AI for the SOC

<h2 id="hackers-exploit-sharepoint-zero-day-since-july-7-to-steal-keys-maintain-persistent-access"><a id="article-12"></a>Hackers Exploit SharePoint Zero-Day Since July 7 to Steal Keys, Maintain Persistent Access</h2>

<p>The recently disclosed
critical Microsoft SharePoint vulnerability
has been under exploitation as early as July 7, 2025, according to findings from Check Point Research. The cybersecurity company
said
it observed first exploitation attempts targeting an unnamed major Western government, with the activity intensifying on July 18 and 19, spanning government, telecommunications, and software sectors in North America and Western Europe. Check Point also said the exploitation efforts originated from three different IP addresses – 104.238.159[.]149, 107.191.58[.]76, and 96.9.125[.]147 – one of which was previously tied to the weaponization of security flaws in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) appliances (
CVE-2025-4427 and CVE-2025-4428
). “We’re witnessing an urgent and active threat: a critical zero-day in SharePoint on-prem is being exploited in the wild, putting thousands of global organizations at risk,” Lotem Finkelstein, Director of Threat Intelligence at Check Point Research, told The Hacker News.</p>

<p>“Our team has confirmed dozens of compromise attempts across government, telecom, and tech sectors since July 7. We strongly urge enterprises to update their security systems immediately – this campaign is both sophisticated and fast-moving.”
The attack chains have been observed leveraging CVE-2025-53770, a newly patched remote code execution flaw in SharePoint Server, and chaining it with CVE-2025-49706, a spoofing vulnerability that was patched by Microsoft as part of its July 2025 Patch Tuesday update, to gain initial access and escalate privileges. It’s worth mentioning at this stage that there are two sets of vulnerabilities in SharePoint that have come to light this month -
CVE-2025-49704
(CVSS score: 8.8) - Microsoft SharePoint Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (Fixed on July 8, 2025)
CVE-2025-49706
(CVSS score: 6.5) - Microsoft SharePoint Server Spoofing Vulnerability (Fixed on July 8, 2025)
CVE-2025-53770
(CVSS score: 9.8) - Microsoft SharePoint Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
CVE-2025-53771
(CVSS score: 6.5) - Microsoft SharePoint Server Spoofing Vulnerability
CVE-2025-49704 and CVE-2025-49706, collectively referred to as ToolShell, is an exploitation chain that can lead to remote code execution on SharePoint Server instances. They were
originally disclosed
by Viettel Cyber Security during the Pwn2Own 2025 hacking competition earlier this May.</p>

<p>CVE-2025-53770 and CVE-2025-53771, which became public knowledge over the weekend, have been described as variants of CVE-2025-49704 and CVE-2025-49706, respectively, indicating that they are bypasses for the original fixes put in place by Microsoft earlier this month. This is evidenced by the fact that Microsoft
acknowledged
active attacks exploiting “vulnerabilities partially addressed by the July Security Update.” The company also noted in its advisories that the updates for CVE-2025-53770 and CVE-2025-53771 include “more robust protections” than the updates for CVE-2025-49704 and CVE-2025-49706. However, it bears noting that CVE-2025-53771 has not been flagged by Redmond as actively exploited in the wild. “CVE-2025-53770 exploits a weakness in how Microsoft SharePoint Server handles the deserialization of untrusted data,” Martin Zugec, technical solutions director at Bitdefender,
said
.</p>

<p>“Attackers are leveraging this flaw to gain unauthenticated remote code execution.”
This, in turn, is achieved by deploying malicious ASP.NET web shells that programmatically extract sensitive cryptographic keys. These stolen keys are subsequently leveraged to craft and sign malicious __VIEWSTATE payloads, thereby establishing persistent access and enabling the execution of arbitrary commands on SharePoint Server. According to Bitdefender telemetry, in-the-wild exploitation has been detected in the United States, Canada, Austria, Jordan, Mexico, Germany, South Africa, Switzerland, and the Netherlands, suggesting widespread abuse of the flaw. Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, in its own analysis of the campaign, said it observed commands being run to execute a Base64-encoded PowerShell command, which creates a file at the location “C:\PROGRA~1\COMMON~1\MICROS~1\WEBSER~1\16\TEMPLATE\LAYOUTS\spinstall0.aspx” and then parses its content.</p>

<p>“The spinstall0.aspx file is a web shell that can execute various functions to retrieve ValidationKeys, DecryptionKeys, and the CompatabilityMode of the server, which are needed to forge ViewState Encryption keys,” Unit 42
said
in a threat brief. Content of spinstall0.aspx
In an advisory issued Monday, SentinelOne said it first detected exploitation on July 17, with the cybersecurity company identifying three “distinct attack clusters,” including state-aligned threat actors, engaging in reconnaissance and early-stage exploitation activities. Targets of the campaigns include technology consulting, manufacturing, critical infrastructure, and professional services tied to sensitive architecture and engineering organizations. “The early targets suggest that the activity was initially carefully selective, aimed at organizations with strategic value or elevated access,” researchers Simon Kenin, Jim Walter, and Tom Hegel
said
.</p>

<p>Analysis of the attack activity has revealed the use of a password-protected ASPX web shell (“xxx.aspx”) on July 18, 2025, at 9:58 a.m. GMT. The web shell supports three functions: Authentication via an embedded form, command execution via cmd.exe, and file upload. Subsequent exploitation efforts have been found to employ the “spinstall0.aspx” web shell to extract and expose sensitive cryptographic material from the host.</p>

<p>Spinstall0.aspx is “not a traditional command web shell but rather a reconnaissance and persistence utility,” the researchers explained. “This code extracts and prints the host’s MachineKey values, including the ValidationKey, DecryptionKey, and cryptographic mode settings – information critical for attackers seeking to maintain persistent access across load-balanced SharePoint environments or to forge authentication tokens.”
Unlike other web shells that are typically dropped on internet-exposed servers to facilitate remote access, spinstall0.aspx appears to be designed with the sole intention of gathering cryptographic secrets that could then be used to forge authentication or session tokens across SharePoint instances. These attacks, per
CrowdStrike
, commence with a specially crafted HTTP POST request to an accessible SharePoint server via the
“/_layouts/15/ToolPane.aspx” endpoint
that attempts to write spinstall0.aspx via PowerShell. The company said it blocked hundreds of exploitation attempts across more than 160 customer environments.</p>

<p>SentinelOne also discovered a cluster dubbed “no shell” that took a “more advanced and stealthy approach” to other threat actors by opting for in-memory .NET module execution without dropping any payloads on disk. The activity originated from the IP address 96.9.125[.]147. “This approach significantly complicates detection and forensic recovery, underscoring the threat posed by fileless post-exploitation techniques,” the company said, positing that it’s either a “skilled red team emulation exercise or the work of a capable threat actor with a focus on evasive access and credential harvesting.”
It’s currently not known who is behind the attack activity, although Google-owned Mandiant has
attributed
the early-exploitation to a China-aligned hacking group. Data from Censys
shows
that there are 9,762 on-premises SharePoint servers online, although it’s currently not known if all of them are susceptible to the flaws.</p>

<p>Given that SharePoint servers are a lucrative target for threat actors due to the nature of sensitive organizational data stored in them, it’s essential that users move quickly to
apply the fixes
, rotate the keys, and restart the instances. “We assess that at least one of the actors responsible for the early exploitation is a China-nexus threat actor,” Charles Carmakal, CTO, Mandiant Consulting at Google Cloud,
said
in a post on LinkedIn. “We’re aware of victims in several sectors and global geographies. The activity primarily involved the theft of machine key material which could be used to access victim environments after the patch has been applied.”
(The story was updated after publication on July 23, 2025, to reflect the change in CVSS scores.)

<h2 id="iran-linked-dchspy-android-malware-masquerades-as-vpn-apps-to-spy-on-dissidents"><a id="article-13"></a>Iran-Linked DCHSpy Android Malware Masquerades as VPN Apps to Spy on Dissidents</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have unearthed new Android spyware artifacts that are likely affiliated with the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) and have been distributed to targets by masquerading as VPN apps and Starlink, a satellite internet connection service offered by SpaceX. Mobile security vendor Lookout said it discovered four samples of a surveillanceware tool it tracks as
DCHSpy
one week after the onset of the Israel-Iran conflict last month. Exactly how many people may have installed these apps is not clear. “DCHSpy collects WhatsApp data, accounts, contacts, SMS, files, location, and call logs, and can record audio and take photos,” security researchers Alemdar Islamoglu and Justin Albrecht
said
.</p>

<p>First detected in July 2024, DCHSpy is assessed to be the handiwork of
MuddyWater
, an Iranian nation-state group tied to MOIS. The hacking crew is also called Boggy Serpens, Cobalt Ulster, Earth Vetala, ITG17, Mango Sandstorm (formerly Mercury), Seedworm, Static Kitten, TA450, and Yellow Nix. Early iterations of DCHSPy have been identified targeting English and Farsi speakers via Telegram channels using themes that run counter to the Iranian regime. Given the use of VPN lures to advertise the malware, it’s likely that dissidents, activists, and journalists are a target of the activity.</p>

<p>It’s suspected that the newly identified DCHSpy variants are being deployed against adversaries in the wake of the recent conflict in the region by passing them off as seemingly useful services like Earth VPN (“com.earth.earth_vpn”), Comodo VPN (“com.comodoapp.comodovpn”), and Hide VPN (“com.hv.hide_vpn”). Interestingly, one of the Earth VPN app samples has been
found
to be distributed in the form of APK files using the name “starlink_vpn(1.3.0)-3012 (1).apk,” indicating that the malware is likely being spread to targets using Starlink-related lures. It’s worth noting that Starlink’s satellite internet service was
activated
in Iran last month amid a government-imposed
internet blackout
. But, weeks later, the country’s parliament
voted
to
outlaw
its use over unauthorized operations.</p>

<p>A modular trojan, DCHSpy is equipped to collect a wide range of data, including account signed-in to the device, contacts, SMS messages, call logs, files, location, ambient audio, photos, and WhatsApp information. DCHSpy also shares infrastructure with another Android malware known as
SandStrike
, which was flagged by Kaspersky in November 2022 as targeting Persian-speaking individuals by posing as seemingly harmless VPN applications. The discovery of DCHSpy is the latest instance of Android spyware that has been used to target individuals and entities in the Middle East. Other documented malware strains include
AridSpy
,
BouldSpy
,
GuardZoo
,
RatMilad
, and
SpyNote
.</p>

<p>“DCHSpy uses similar tactics and infrastructure as SandStrike,” Lookout said. “It is distributed to targeted groups and individuals by leveraging malicious URLs shared directly over messaging apps such as Telegram.”
“These most recent samples of DCHSpy indicate continued development and usage of the surveillanceware as the situation in the Middle East evolves, especially as Iran cracks down on its citizens following the ceasefire with Israel.”
