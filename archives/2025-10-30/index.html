<h2 id="experts-reports-sharp-increase-in-automated-botnet-attacks-targeting-php-servers-and-iot-devices"><a id="article-1"></a>Experts Reports Sharp Increase in Automated Botnet Attacks Targeting PHP Servers and IoT Devices</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers are calling attention to a spike in automated attacks targeting PHP servers, IoT devices, and cloud gateways by various botnets such as
Mirai
,
Gafgyt
, and
Mozi
. “These automated campaigns exploit known CVE vulnerabilities and cloud misconfigurations to gain control over exposed systems and expand botnet networks,” the Qualys Threat Research Unit (TRU) said in a report shared with The Hacker News. The cybersecurity company said PHP servers have emerged as the most prominent targets of these attacks owing to the widespread use of content management systems like
WordPress
and
Craft CMS
. This, in turn, creates a large attack surface as many PHP deployments can suffer from misconfigurations, outdated plugins and themes, and insecure file storage.</p>

<p>Some of the prominent weaknesses in PHP frameworks that have been exploited by threat actors are listed below -
CVE-2017-9841</p>
<ul>
  <li>A Remote code execution vulnerability in PHPUnit
CVE-2021-3129</li>
  <li>A Remote code execution vulnerability in Laravel
CVE-2022-47945</li>
  <li>A Remote code execution vulnerability in ThinkPHP Framework
Qualys said it has also observed exploitation efforts that involve the use of “/?XDEBUG_SESSION_START=phpstorm” query string in HTTP GET requests to initiate an
Xdebug debugging session
with an integrated development environment (IDE) like PhpStorm. “If Xdebug is unintentionally left active in production environments, attackers may use these sessions to gain insight into application behavior or extract sensitive data,” the company said. Alternatively, threat actors are continuing to look for credentials, API keys, and access tokens in internet-exposed servers to take control of susceptible systems, as well as leverage known security flaws in IoT devices to co-opt them into a botnet. These include -
CVE-2022-22947</li>
  <li>A Remote code execution vulnerability in Spring Cloud Gateway
CVE-2024-3721</li>
  <li>A Command injection vulnerability in TBK DVR-4104 and DVR-4216
A Misconfiguration in MVPower TV-7104HE DVR that allows unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary system commands via an HTTP GET request
The scanning activity, Qualys added, often originates from cloud infrastructures like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Digital Ocean, and Akamai Cloud, illustrating how threat actors are abusing legitimate services to their advantage while obscuring their true origins.</li>
</ul>

<p>“Today’s threat actors don’t need to be highly sophisticated to be effective,” it noted. “With widely available exploit kits, botnet frameworks, and scanning tools, even entry-level attackers can cause significant damage.”
To safeguard against the threat, it’s advised that users keep their devices up-to-date, remove development and debug tools in production environments, secure secrets using AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault, and restrict public access to cloud infrastructure. “While botnets have previously been associated with large-scale DDoS attacks and occasional crypto mining scams, in the age of identity security threats, we see them taking on a new role in the threat ecosystem,” James Maude, field CTO at BeyondTrust, said. “Having access to a vast network of routers and their IP addresses can allow threat actors to perform credential stuffing and password spray attacks a huge scale.</p>

<p>Botnets can also evade geolocation controls by stealing a user’s credentials or hijacking a browser session and then using a botnet node close to the victim’s actual location and maybe even using the same ISP as the victim to evade unusual login detections or access policies.”
The disclosure comes as NETSCOUT classified the DDoS-for-hire botnet known as
AISURU
as a new class of malware dubbed TurboMirai that can launch DDoS attacks that exceed 20 terabits per second (Tbps). The botnet primarily comprises consumer-grade broadband access routers, online CCTV and DVR systems, and other customer premise equipment (CPE). “These botnets incorporate additional dedicated DDoS attack capabilities and multi-use functions, enabling both DDoS attacks and other illicit activities such as credential stuffing, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven web scraping, spamming, and phishing,” the company
said
. “AISURU includes an onboard residential proxy service used to reflect HTTPS application-layer DDoS attacks generated by external attack harnesses.”
Turning compromised devices into a residential proxy allows paying customers to route their traffic through one of the nodes in the botnet, offering anonymity and the ability to blend in with regular network activity.</p>

<p>According to independent security journalist Brian Krebs, all of the major proxy services have
grown exponentially
over the past six months, citing data from spur.us. Found this article interesting? Follow us on

<h2 id="new-ai-targeted-cloaking-attack-tricks-ai-crawlers-into-citing-fake-info-as-verified-facts"><a id="article-2"></a>New AI-Targeted Cloaking Attack Tricks AI Crawlers Into Citing Fake Info as Verified Facts</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have flagged a new security issue in agentic web browsers like OpenAI ChatGPT Atlas that exposes underlying artificial intelligence (AI) models to context poisoning attacks. In the attack
devised
by AI security company SPLX, a bad actor can set up websites that serve different content to browsers and
AI crawlers
run by ChatGPT and Perplexity. The technique has been codenamed
AI-targeted cloaking
. The approach is a variation of search engine cloaking, which refers to the practice of presenting one version of a web page to users and a different version to search engine crawlers with the end goal of manipulating search rankings.</p>

<p>The only difference in this case is that attackers optimize for AI crawlers from various providers by means of a trivial user agent check that leads to content delivery manipulation. “Because these systems rely on direct retrieval, whatever content is served to them becomes ground truth in AI Overviews, summaries, or autonomous reasoning,” security researchers Ivan Vlahov and Bastien Eymery said. “That means a single conditional rule, ‘if user agent = ChatGPT, serve this page instead,’ can shape what millions of users see as authoritative output.”
SPLX said AI-targeted cloaking, while deceptively simple, can also be turned into a powerful misinformation weapon, undermining trust in AI tools. By instructing AI crawlers to load something else instead of the actual content, it can also introduce bias and influence the outcome of systems leaning on such signals.</p>

<p>“AI crawlers can be deceived just as easily as early search engines, but with far greater downstream impact,” the company said. “As SEO [search engine optimization] increasingly incorporates AIO [artificial intelligence optimization], it manipulates reality.”
The disclosure comes as an analysis of browser agents against 20 of the most common abuse scenarios, ranging from multi-accounting to card testing and support impersonation, discovered that the products attempted nearly every malicious request without the need for any jailbreaking, the hCaptcha Threat Analysis Group (hTAG) said. Furthermore, the study
found
that in scenarios where an action was “blocked,” it mostly came down due to the tool missing a technical capability rather than due to safeguards built into them. ChatGPT Atlas, hTAG noted, has been found to carry out risky tasks when they are framed as part of debugging exercises.</p>

<p>Claude Computer Use and Gemini Computer Use, on the other hand, have been identified as capable of executing dangerous account operations like password resets without any constraints, with the latter also demonstrating aggressive behavior when it comes to brute-forcing coupons on e-commerce sites. hTAG also tested the safety measures of Manus AI, uncovering that it executes account takeovers and session hijacking without any issue, while Perplexity Comet runs unprompted SQL injection to exfiltrate hidden data. “Agents often went above and beyond, attempting SQL injection without a user request, injecting JavaScript on-page to attempt to circumvent paywalls, and more,” it said. “The near-total lack of safeguards we observed makes it very likely that these same agents will also be rapidly used by attackers against any legitimate users who happen to download them.”

<h2 id="preparing-for-the-digital-battlefield-of-2026-ghost-identities-poisoned-accounts--ai-agent-havoc"><a id="article-5"></a>Preparing for the Digital Battlefield of 2026: Ghost Identities, Poisoned Accounts, &amp; AI Agent Havoc</h2>

<p>BeyondTrust’s annual cybersecurity predictions point to a year where old defenses will fail quietly, and new attack vectors will surge. Introduction
The next major breach won’t be a phished password. It will be the result of a massive, unmanaged identity debt. This debt takes many forms: it’s the “ghost” identity from a 2015 breach lurking in your IAM, the privilege sprawl from thousands of new AI agents bloating your
attack surface
, or the automated account poisoning that exploits weak identity verification in financial systems.</p>

<p>All of these vectors—physical, digital, new, and old—are converging on one single point of failure:
identity
. Based on analysis from BeyondTrust’s cybersecurity experts, here are three critical identity-based threats that will define the coming year:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Agentic AI Emerges as the Ultimate Attack Vector
By 2026,
agentic AI
will be connected to nearly every technology we operate, effectively becoming the new middleware for most organizations. The problem is that this integration is driven by a speed-to-market push that leaves cybersecurity as an afterthought.</li>
</ol>

<p>This rush is creating a massive new attack surface built on a classic vulnerability: the confused deputy problem. A “deputy” is any program with legitimate privileges. The “confused deputy problem” occurs when a low-privilege entity—like a user, account, or another application—tricks that deputy into misusing its power to gain high privileges. The deputy, lacking the context to see the malicious intent, executes the command or shares results beyond its original design or intentions.</p>

<p>Now, apply this to AI. An agentic AI tool may be granted least privilege access to read a user’s email, access a CI/CD pipeline, or query a production database. If that AI, acting as a trusted deputy, is “confused” by a cleverly crafted prompt from another resource, it can be manipulated into exfiltrating sensitive data, deploying malicious code, or escalating higher privileges on the user’s behalf. The AI is executing tasks it has permission for, but on behalf of an attacker who does not, and can elevate privileges based on the attack vector.</p>

<p>Defender Tip:
This threat requires treating AI agents as potentially privileged machine identities. Security teams must enforce strict least privilege,
ensuring AI tools only have the absolute minimum permissions necessary
for specific tasks. This includes implementing context-aware access controls, command filtering, and real-time auditing to prevent these trusted agents from becoming malicious actors by proxy. 2.</p>

<p>Account Poisoning: The Next Evolution of Financial Fraud
In the coming year, expect a significant rise in “account poisoning”, where threat actors find new ways to insert fraudulent billers and payees into consumer and business financial accounts at scale. This “poison” is driven by automation that allows for the creation of payees and billers, the requesting of funds, and linking to other online payment processing sources. This attack vector is particularly dangerous because it exploits weaknesses in online financial systems, leverages poor
secrets management
to attack in bulk, and uses automation to obfuscate the transactions. Defender Tip:
Security teams must move beyond flagging individual account takeovers and focus on high-velocity, automated changes to payee and biller information.</p>

<p>The key is implementing tighter diligence and identity confidence checks for any automated process that requests to modify these financial fields. 3. Ghosts in Your IAM: Historic Identity Compromises Catch Up
Many organizations are finally modernizing their identity and access management (IAM) programs, adopting new tools, like graph-based analytics, to map their complex identity landscapes. In 2026, these efforts will uncover skeletons in the closet: “ghost” identities from long-past solutions and breaches that were never detected.</p>

<p>These “backdated breaches” will reveal rogue accounts—some years old—that remain in active use. Because these compromises are older than most security logs, it may be impossible for teams to determine the full extent of the original breach. Defender Tip:
This prediction underscores the long-standing failure of basic joiner-mover-leaver (JML) processes. The immediate takeaway is to prioritize identity governance and use
modern identity graphing tools
to find and eliminate these dormant, high-risk accounts before they are rediscovered by attackers.</p>

<p>Other Trends on the Radar
The Death of the VPN
For years, the VPN was the workhorse of
remote access
, but in modern remote access, VPN is a critical vulnerability waiting to be exploited. Threat actors have mastered VPN exploitation techniques, using credential harvesting and compromised appliances for persistent access. Using traditional VPNs for privileged access presents a risk that organizations can no longer afford. The Rise of AI Veganism
As a cultural counterforce, 2026 will witness the rise of “AI veganism”, where employees or customers abstain from using artificial intelligence on principle.</p>

<p>This movement, driven by ethical concerns over data sourcing, algorithmic bias, and environmental costs, will challenge the assumption that AI adoption is inevitable. Companies will have to navigate this resistance by offering transparent governance, human-first alternatives, and clear opt-outs. However, when it comes to cybersecurity, opting out of
AI-driven defenses
may be less of an option and could even shift liability back to the user. An Identity-First Security Posture is Non-Negotiable
The common thread through these 2026 predictions is identity.</p>

<p>The new AI attack surface is an identity-privilege problem, account poisoning is an identity verification problem, while backdated breaches are an identity lifecycle problem. As the perimeter widens, organizations must adopt an identity-first security posture by applying principles of least privilege and zero trust to every human and non-human identity.

<h2 id="russian-hackers-target-ukrainian-organizations-using-stealthy-living-off-the-land-tactics"><a id="article-6"></a>Russian Hackers Target Ukrainian Organizations Using Stealthy Living-Off-the-Land Tactics</h2>

<p>Organizations in Ukraine have been targeted by threat actors of Russian origin with an aim to siphon sensitive data and maintain persistent access to compromised networks. The activity, according to a
new report
from the Symantec and Carbon Black Threat Hunter Team, targeted a large business services organization for two months and a local government entity in the country for a week. The attacks mainly leveraged living-off-the-land (LotL) tactics and dual-use tools, coupled with minimal malware, to reduce digital footprints and stay undetected for extended periods of time. “The attackers gained access to the business services organization by deploying web shells on public-facing servers, most likely by exploiting one or more unpatched vulnerabilities,” the Broadcom-owned cybersecurity teams said in a report shared with The Hacker News.</p>

<p>One of the web shells used in the attack was Localolive, which was
previously flagged
by Microsoft as put to use by a sub-group of the Russia-linked Sandworm crew as part of a multi-year campaign codenamed BadPilot. LocalOlive is designed to facilitate the delivery of next-stage payloads like Chisel, plink, and rsockstun. It has been utilized since at least late 2021. Early signs of malicious activity targeting the business services organization date back to June 27, 2025, with the attackers leveraging the foothold to drop a web shell and use it to conduct reconnaissance.</p>

<p>The threat actors have also been found to run PowerShell commands to exclude the machine’s Downloads from Microsoft Defender Antivirus scans, as well as set up a scheduled task to perform a memory dump every 30 minutes. Over the next couple of weeks, the attackers carried out a variety of actions, including -
Save a copy of the registry hive to a file named 1.log
Dropping more web shells
Using the web shell to enumerate all files in the user directory
Running a command to list all running processes beginning with “kee,” likely with the goal of targeting the KeePass password storage vault
Listing all active user sessions on a second machine
Running executables named “service.exe” and “cloud.exe” located in the Downloads folder
Running reconnaissance commands on a third machine and performing a memory dump using the Microsoft Windows Resource Leak Diagnostic tool (RDRLeakDiag)
Modifying the registry permits RDP connections to allow inbound RDP connections
Running a PowerShell command to retrieve information about the Windows configuration on a fourth machine
Running RDPclip to gain access to the clipboard in remote desktop connections
Installing OpenSSH to facilitate remote access to the computer
Running a PowerShell command to allow TCP traffic on port 22 for the OpenSSH server
Creating a scheduled task to run an unknown PowerShell backdoor (link.ps1) every 30 minutes using a domain account
Running an unknown Python script
Deploying a legitimate MikroTik router management application (“
winbox64.exe
“) in the Downloads folder
Interestingly, the presence of “winbox64.exe” was also documented by CERT-UA in April 2024 in connection with a
Sandworm campaign
aimed at energy, water, and heating suppliers in Ukraine. Symantec and Carbon Black said it could not find any evidence in the intrusions to connect it to Sandworm, but said it “did appear to be Russian in origin.” The cybersecurity company also revealed that the attacks were characterized by the deployment of several PowerShell backdoors and suspicious executables that are likely to be malware. However, none of these artifacts have been obtained for analysis.</p>

<p>“While the attackers used a limited amount of malware during the intrusion, much of the malicious activity that took place involved legitimate tools, either Living-off-the-Land or dual-use software introduced by the attackers,” Symantec and Carbon Black said. “The attackers demonstrated an in-depth knowledge of Windows native tools and showed how a skilled attacker can advance an attack and steal sensitive information, such as credentials, while leaving a minimal footprint on the targeted network.”
The disclosure comes as Gen Threat Labs detailed
Gamaredon
‘s exploitation of a now-patched security flaw in WinRAR (
CVE-2025-8088
, CVSS score: 8.8) to strike Ukrainian government agencies. “Attackers are abusing #CVE-2025-8088 (WinRAR path traversal) to deliver RAR archives that silently drop HTA malware into the Startup folder – no user interaction needed beyond opening the benign PDF inside,” the company
said
in a post on X. “These lures are crafted to trick victims into opening weaponized archives, continuing a pattern of aggressive targeting seen in previous campaigns.”
The findings also follow a report from Recorded Future, which found that the Russian cybercriminal ecosystem is being actively shaped by international law enforcement campaigns such as
Operation Endgame
, shifting the Russian government’s ties with e-crime groups from passive tolerance to active management.</p>

<p>Further analysis of leaked chats has uncovered that senior figures within these threat groups often maintain relationships with Russian intelligence services, providing data, performing tasking, or leveraging bribery and political connections for impunity. At the same time, cybercriminal crews are decentralizing operations to sidestep Western and domestic surveillance. While it’s been long known that Russian cybercriminals could operate freely as long as they do not target businesses or entities operating in the region, Kremlin appears to be now taking a more nuanced approach where they recruit or co-opt talent when necessary, turn a blind eye when attacks align with their interests, and selectively enforce laws when the threat actors become “politically inconvenient or externally embarrassing.”
Viewed in that the “dark covenant” is a combination of several things: a commercial enterprise, tool of influence and information acquisition, and also a liability when it threatens domestic stability or because of Western pressure. “The Russian cybercriminal underground is fracturing under the dual pressures of state control and internal mistrust, while proprietary forum monitoring and ransomware affiliate chatter show increasing paranoia among operators,” the company
noted
in its third instalment of the Dark Covenant report.</p>

<h2 id="10-npm-packages-caught-stealing-developer-credentials-on-windows-macos-and-linux"><a id="article-7"></a>10 npm Packages Caught Stealing Developer Credentials on Windows, macOS, and Linux</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a set of 10 malicious npm packages that are designed to deliver an information stealer targeting Windows, Linux, and macOS systems. “The malware uses four layers of obfuscation to hide its payload, displays a fake CAPTCHA to appear legitimate, fingerprints victims by IP address, and downloads a 24MB PyInstaller-packaged information stealer that harvests credentials from system keyrings, browsers, and authentication services across Windows, Linux, and macOS,” Socket security researcher Kush Pandya
said
. The npm packages were uploaded to the registry on July 4, 2025, and accumulated over 9,900 downloads collectively -
deezcord.js
dezcord.js
dizcordjs
etherdjs
ethesjs
ethetsjs
nodemonjs
react-router-dom.js
typescriptjs
zustand.js
The multi-stage credential theft operation manifested in the form of various typosquatted packages impersonating popular npm libraries such as TypeScript, discord.js, ethers.js, nodemon, react-router-dom, and zustand. Once installed, the malware serves a fake CAPTCHA prompt and displays authentic-looking output that mimics legitimate package installations to give the impression that the setup process is proceeding along expected lines.</p>

<p>However, in the background, the package captures the victim’s IP address, sends it to an external server (“195.133.79[.]43”), and then proceeds to drop the main malware. In each package, the malicious functionality is automatically triggered upon installation by means of a postinstall hook, launching a script named “install.js” that detects the victim’s operating system and launches an obfuscated payload (“app.js”) in a new Command Prompt (Windows), GNOME Terminal or x-terminal-emulator (Linux), or Terminal (macOS) window. “By spawning a new terminal window, the malware runs independently of the npm install process,” Pandya noted. “Developers who glance at their terminal during installation see a new window briefly appear, which the malware immediately clears to avoid suspicion.”
The JavaScript contained within “app.js” is hidden through four layers of obfuscation – such as XOR cipher with a dynamically generated key, URL-encoding of the payload string, and using hexadecimal and octal arithmetic to obscure program flow – that are designed to resist analysis.</p>

<p>The end goal of the attack is to fetch and execute a comprehensive information stealer (“data_extracter”) from the same server that’s equipped to thoroughly scan the developer’s machine for secrets, authentication tokens, credentials, and session cookies from web browsers, configuration files, and SSH keys. The stealer binary also incorporates platform-specific implementations to extract credentials from the system keyring using the
keyring npm library
. The harvested information is compressed into a ZIP archive and exfiltrated to the server. “System keyrings store credentials for critical services including email clients (Outlook, Thunderbird), cloud storage sync tools (Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive), VPN connections (Cisco AnyConnect, OpenVPN), password managers, SSH passphrases, database connection strings, and other applications that integrate with the OS credential store,” Socket said.</p>

<p>“By targeting the keyring directly, the malware bypasses application-level security and harvests stored credentials in their decrypted form. These credentials provide immediate access to corporate email, file storage, internal networks, and production databases.”

<h2 id="active-exploits-hit-dassault-and-xwiki--cisa-confirms-critical-flaws-under-attack"><a id="article-8"></a>Active Exploits Hit Dassault and XWiki — CISA Confirms Critical Flaws Under Attack</h2>

<p>Threat actors are actively exploiting multiple security flaws impacting Dassault Systèmes DELMIA Apriso and XWiki, according to alerts issued by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (
CISA
) and
VulnCheck
. The vulnerabilities are listed below -
CVE-2025-6204
(CVSS score: 8.0) - A code injection vulnerability in Dassault Systèmes DELMIA Apriso that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. CVE-2025-6205
(CVSS score: 9.1) - A missing authorization vulnerability in Dassault Systèmes DELMIA Apriso that could allow an attacker to gain privileged access to the application.</p>

<p>CVE-2025-24893
(CVSS score: 9.8) - An improper neutralization of input in a dynamic evaluation call (aka
eval injection
) in XWiki that could allow any guest user to perform arbitrary remote code execution through a request to the “/bin/get/Main/SolrSearch” endpoint. Both
CVE-2025-6204
and
CVE-2025-6205
affect DELMIA Apriso versions from Release 2020 through Release 2025. They were addressed by Dassault Systèmes in early August. According to details
shared
by ProjectDiscovery researchers Rahul Maini, Harsh Jaiswal, and Parth Malhotra last month, the two security flaws can be fashioned together into an exploit chain to create accounts with elevated privileges and then drop executable files into a web-served directory, resulting in a full application compromise.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the addition of the two shortcomings to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (
KEV
) catalog comes a little over a month after CISA
flagged
the exploitation of another critical flaw in the same product (CVE-2025-5086, CVSS score: 9.0), a week after the SANS Internet Storm Center detected in-the-wild attempts. It’s currently not known if these efforts are related. VulnCheck, which detected exploitation attempts targeting CVE-2025-24893, said the vulnerability is being abused as part of a two-stage attack chain that delivers a cryptocurrency miner. According to
CrowdSec
and
Cyble
, the vulnerability is said to have been weaponized in real-world attacks as far back as March 2025.</p>

<p>“We observed multiple exploit attempts against our XWiki canaries coming from an attacker geolocated in Vietnam,” VulnCheck’s Jacob Baines said. “The exploitation proceeds in a two-pass workflow separated by at least 20 minutes: the first pass stages a downloader (writes a file to disk), and the second pass later executes it.”
The payload uses wget to retrieve a downloader (“x640”) from “193.32.208[.]24:8080” and write it to the “/tmp/11909” location. The downloader, in turn, runs shell commands to fetch two additional payloads from the same server -
x521, which fetches the cryptocurrency miner located at “193.32.208[.]24:8080/rDuiQRKhs5/tcrond”
x522, which kills competing miners such as XMRig and Kinsing, and launches the miner with a c3pool.org configuration
The attack traffic, per VulnCheck, originates from an IP address that geolocates to Vietnam (“
123.25.249[.]88
“) and has been
flagged
as malicious in AbuseIPDB for engaging in brute-force attempts as recently as October 26, 2025. In light of active exploitation, users are advised to apply the necessary updates as soon as possible to safeguard against threats.</p>

<h2 id="new-teefail-side-channel-attack-extracts-secrets-from-intel-and-amd-ddr5-secure-enclaves"><a id="article-9"></a>New TEE.Fail Side-Channel Attack Extracts Secrets from Intel and AMD DDR5 Secure Enclaves</h2>

<p>A group of academic researchers from Georgia Tech, Purdue University, and Synkhronix have developed a side-channel attack called
TEE.Fail
that allows for the extraction of secrets from the trusted execution environment (TEE) in a computer’s main processor, including Intel’s Software Guard eXtensions (SGX) and Trust Domain Extensions (TDX) and AMD’s Secure Encrypted Virtualization with Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP) and
Ciphertext Hiding
. The attack, at its core, involves the use of an interposition device built using off-the-shelf electronic equipment that costs under $1,000 and makes it possible to physically inspect all memory traffic inside a DDR5 server. “This allows us for the first time to extract cryptographic keys from Intel TDX and AMD SEV-SNP with Ciphertext Hiding, including in some cases secret attestation keys from fully updated machines in trusted status,” the researchers noted on an informational site. “Beyond breaking CPU-based TEEs, we also show how extracted attestation keys can be used to compromise Nvidia’s GPU Confidential Computing, allowing attackers to run AI workloads without any TEE protections.”
The findings come weeks after the release of two other attacks aimed at TEEs, such as
Battering RAM
and
WireTap
.</p>

<p>Unlike these techniques that target systems using DDR4 memory, TEE.Fail is the first attack to be demonstrated against DDR5, meaning they can be used to undermine the latest hardware security protections from Intel and AMD. The latest study has found that the AES-XTS encryption mode used by Intel and AMD is deterministic and, therefore, not sufficient to prevent physical memory interposition attacks. In a hypothetical attack scenario, a bad actor could leverage the custom equipment to record the memory traffic flowing between the computer and DRAM, and observe the memory contents during read and write operations, thereby opening the door to a side-channel attack. This could be ultimately exploited to extract data from confidential virtual machines (CVMs), including ECDSA attestation keys from Intel’s Provisioning Certification Enclave (PCE), necessary in order to break SGX and TDX attestation.</p>

<p>“As attestation is the mechanism used to prove that data and code are actually executed in a CVM, this means that we can pretend that your data and code is running inside a CVM when in reality it is not,” the researchers said. “We can read your data and even provide you with incorrect output, while still faking a successfully completed attestation process.”
The study also pointed out that SEV-SNP with Ciphertext Hiding neither addresses issues with deterministic encryption nor prevents physical bus interposition. As a result, the attack facilitates the extraction of private signing keys from OpenSSL’s ECDSA implementation. “Importantly, OpenSSL’s cryptographic code is fully constant-time and our machine had Ciphertext Hiding enabled, thus showing these features are not sufficient to mitigate bus interposition attacks,” they added.</p>

<p>While there is no evidence that the attack has been put to use in the wild, the researchers recommend using software countermeasures to mitigate the risks arising as a result of deterministic encryption. However, they are likely to be expensive. In response to the disclosure, AMD
said
it has no plans to provide mitigations since physical vector attacks are out of scope for AMD SEV-SNP. Intel, in a similar alert,
noted
that TEE.fail does not change the company’s previous out-of-scope statement for these types of physical attacks.</p>

<h2 id="new-android-trojan-herodotus-outsmarts-anti-fraud-systems-by-typing-like-a-human"><a id="article-10"></a>New Android Trojan ‘Herodotus’ Outsmarts Anti-Fraud Systems by Typing Like a Human</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a new Android banking trojan called
Herodotus
that has been observed in active campaigns targeting Italy and Brazil to conduct device takeover (
DTO
) attacks. “Herodotus is designed to perform device takeover while making first attempts to mimic human behaviour and bypass behaviour biometrics detection,” ThreatFabric
said
in a report shared with The Hacker News. The Dutch security company said the Trojan was first advertised in underground forums on September 7, 2025, as part of the malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model, touting its ability to run on devices running Android version 9 to 16. It’s assessed that while the malware is not a direct evolution of another banking malware known as
Brokewell
, it certainly appears to have taken certain parts of it to put together the new strain.</p>

<p>This includes similarities in the obfuscation technique used, as well as direct mentions of Brokewell in Herodotus (e.g., “BRKWL_JAVA”). Herodotus is also the latest in a long list of Android malware to abuse accessibility services to realize its goals. Distributed via dropper apps masquerading as Google Chrome (package name “com.cd3.app”) through SMS phishing or other social engineering ploys, the malicious program leverages the accessibility feature to interact with the screen, serve opaque overlay screens to hide malicious activity, and conduct credential theft by displaying bogus login screens atop financial apps. Additionally, it can also steal two-factor authentication (2FA) codes sent via SMS, intercept everything that’s displayed on the screen, grant itself extra permissions as required, grab the lockscreen PIN or pattern, and install remote APK files.</p>

<p>But where the new malware stands out is in its ability to humanize fraud and evade timing-based detections. Specifically, this includes an option to introduce random delays when initiating remote actions such as typing text on the device. This, ThreatFabric said, is an attempt by the threat actors to make it seem like the input is being entered by an actual user. “The delay specified is in the range of 300 – 3000 milliseconds (0,3 - 3 seconds),” it explained.</p>

<p>“Such a randomization of delay between text input events does align with how a user would input text. By consciously delaying the input by random intervals, actors are likely trying to avoid being detected by behaviour-only anti-fraud solutions spotting machine-like speed of text input.”
ThreatFabric said it also obtained overlay pages used by Herodotus targeting financial organisations in the U.S., Turkey, the U.K., and Poland, along with cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges, indicating that the operators are attempting to actively expand their horizons. “It is under active development, borrows techniques long associated with the Brokewell banking Trojan, and appears purpose-built to persist inside live sessions rather than simply steal static credentials and focus on account takeover,” the company noted. The findings comes as CYFIRMA detailed an advanced Android malware named GhostGrab that’s capable of systematically harvesting banking credentials while covertly mining Monero cryptocurrency on infected devices, creating a “dual-revenue stream” for the threat actors.</p>

<p>The campaign appears to be targeting Android users in India. The dropper app, which impersonates a financial app, requests for the
REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES
permission to facilitate in-app installation of additional APKs without using the Google Play Store. The main payload installed on the device requests a high-risk set of permissions to enable call forwarding, steal SMS data, and serve fake WebView pages that mimic a KYC form to collect personal information, including card details, four-digit ATM PIN, and government ID such as Aadhaar number. “GhostGrab functions as a hybrid threat, combining covert cryptocurrency mining operations with comprehensive data exfiltration capabilities,” the company
said
.</p>

<p>“It is engineered to systematically harvest sensitive financial information, including banking credentials, debit card details, and one-time passwords (OTPs) via SMS interception.”

<h2 id="researchers-expose-ghostcall-and-ghosthire-bluenoroffs-new-malware-chains"><a id="article-11"></a>Researchers Expose GhostCall and GhostHire: BlueNoroff’s New Malware Chains</h2>

<p>Threat actors tied to North Korea have been observed targeting the Web3 and blockchain sectors as part of twin campaigns tracked as
GhostCall
and
GhostHire
. According to Kaspersky, the campaigns are part of a broader operation called
SnatchCrypto
that has been underway since at least 2017. The activity is attributed to a Lazarus Group sub-cluster called
BlueNoroff
, which is also known as APT38, CageyChameleon, CryptoCore, Genie Spider, Nickel Gladstone, Sapphire Sleet (formerly Copernicium), and Stardust Chollima. Victims of the GhostCall campaign span several infected macOS hosts located in Japan, Italy, France, Singapore, Turkey, Spain, Sweden, India, and Hong Kong, whereas Japan and Australia have been identified as the major hunting grounds for the GhostHire campaign.</p>

<p>“GhostCall heavily targets the macOS devices of executives at tech companies and in the venture capital sector by directly approaching targets via platforms like Telegram, and inviting potential victims to investment-related meetings linked to Zoom-like phishing websites,” Kaspersky researchers Sojun Ryu and Omar Amin
said
. “The victim would join a fake call with genuine recordings of this threat’s other actual victims rather than deepfakes. The call proceeds smoothly to then encourages the user to update the Zoom client with a script. Eventually, the script downloads ZIP files that result in infection chains deployed on an infected host.”
On the other hand, GhostHire involves approaching prospective targets, such as Web3 developers, on Telegram and luring them into downloading and executing a booby-trapped GitHub repository under the pretext of completing a skill assessment within 30 minutes of sharing the link, so as to ensure a higher success rate of infection.</p>

<p>Once installed, the project is designed to download a malicious payload onto the developer’s system based on the operating system used. The Russian cybersecurity company said it has been keeping tabs on the two campaigns since April 2025, although it’s assessed that GhostCall has been active since mid-2023, likely following the
RustBucket
campaign. RustBucket marked the adversarial collective’s major pivot to targeting macOS systems, following which other campaigns have leveraged malware families like
KANDYKORN
,
ObjCShellz
, and
TodoSwift
. It’s worth noting that various aspects of the activity have been documented extensively over the past year by multiple security vendors, including
Microsoft
,
Huntress, Field Effect
,
Huntabil.IT, Validin, and SentinelOne
.</p>

<p>The GhostCall Campaign
Targets who land on the fake Zoom pages as part of the GhostCall campaign are initially served a bogus page that gives the illusion of a live call, only to display an error message three to five seconds later, urging them to download a Zoom software development kit (SDK) to address a purported issue with continuing the call. Should the victims fall for the trap and attempt to update the SDK by clicking on the “Update Now” option, it leads to the download of a malicious AppleScript file onto their system. In the event the victim is using a Windows machine, the attack leverages the
ClickFix technique
to copy and run a PowerShell command. GhostCall campaign attack flow
At each stage, every interaction with the fake site is recorded and beaconed to the attackers to track the victim’s actions.</p>

<p>As recently as last month, the threat actor has been observed transitioning from Zoom to Microsoft Teams, using the same tactic of tricking users into downloading a TeamsFx SDK this time to trigger the infection chain. Regardless of the lure used, the AppleScript is designed to install a phony application disguised as Zoom or Microsoft Teams. It also downloads another AppleScript dubbed DownTroy that checks stored passwords associated with password management applications and installs additional malware with root privileges. DownTroy, for its part, is engineered to drop several payloads as part of eight distinct attack chains, while also bypassing Apple’s Transparency, Consent, and Control (
TCC
) framework -
ZoomClutch or TeamsClutch, which uses a Swift-based implant that masquerades as Zoom or Teams while harboring functionality to prompt the user to enter their system password in order to complete the app update and exfiltrate the details to an external server
DownTroy v1, which uses a Go-based dropper to launch the AppleScript-based DownTroy malware that’s then responsible for downloading additional scripts from the server until the machine is rebooted.</p>

<p>CosmicDoor, which uses a C++ binary loader called GillyInjector (aka InjectWithDyld) to run a benign Mach-O app and inject a malicious payload into it at runtime. When it’s run with the –d flag, GillyInjector activates its destructive capabilities and irrevocably wipes all files in the current directory. The injected payload is a backdoor written in Nim named CosmicDoor that can communicate with an external server to receive and execute commands. It’s believed that the attackers first developed a Go version of CosmicDoor for Windows, before moving to Rust, Python, and Nim variants.</p>

<p>It also downloads a bash script stealer suite named SilentSiphon. RooTroy, which uses Nimcore loader to launch GillyInjector, which then injects a Go backdoor called RooTroy (aka Root Troy V4) to collect device information, enumerate running processes, read payload from a specific file, and download additional malware (counting RealTimeTroy) and execute them. RealTimeTroy, which uses Nimcore loader to launch GillyInjector, which then injects a Go backdoor called RealTimeTroy that communicates with an external server using the WSS protocol to read/write files, get directory and process information, upload/download files, terminate a specified process, and get device information. SneakMain, which uses Nimcore loader to launch a Nim payload called SneakMain to receive and execute additional AppleScript commands received from an external server.</p>

<p>DownTroy v2, which uses a dropper named CoreKitAgent to launch Nimcore loader, which then launches AppleScript-based DownTroy (aka NimDoor) to download an additional malicious script from an external server. SysPhon, which uses a lightweight version of RustBucket named SysPhon and
SUGARLOADER
, a known loader previously to have delivered the KANDYKORN malware. SysPhon, also employed in the
Hidden Risk
campaign, is a downloader written in C++ that can conduct reconnaissance and fetch a binary payload from an external server. Overall behavior of the Zoom phishing site
SilentSiphon is equipped to harvest data from Apple Notes, Telegram, web browser extensions, as well as credentials from browsers and password managers, and secrets stored in configuration files related to a long list of services: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, npm, Yarn, Python pip, RubyGems, Rust cargo, NET Nuget, AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud, Akamai Linode, DigitalOcean API, Vercel, Cloudflare, Netlify, Stripe, Firebase, Twilio, CircleCI, Pulumi, HashiCorp, SSH, FTP, Sui Blockchain, Solana, NEAR Blockchain, Aptos Blockchain, Algorand, Docker, Kubernetes, and OpenAI.</p>

<p>“While the video feeds for fake calls were recorded via the fabricated Zoom phishing pages the actor created, the profile images of meeting participants appear to have been sourced from job platforms or social media platforms such as LinkedIn, Crunchbase, or X,” Kaspersky said. “Interestingly, some of these images were enhanced with [OpenAI] GPT-4o.”
The GhostHire Campaign
The GhostHire campaign, the Russian cybersecurity company added, also dates back to mid-2023, with the attackers initiating contact with the targets directly on Telegram, sharing details of a job offer along with a link to a LinkedIn profile impersonating recruiters at financial companies based in the U.S. in an attempt to lend the conversations a veneer of legitimacy. “Following up on initial communication, the actor adds the target to a user list for a Telegram bot, which displays the impersonated company’s logo and falsely claims to streamline technical assessments for candidates,” Kaspersky explained.</p>

<p>DownTroy delivery process in GhostHire campaign
“The bot then sends the victim an archive file (ZIP) containing a coding assessment project, along with a strict deadline (often around 30 minutes) to pressure the target into quickly completing the task. This urgency increases the likelihood of the target executing the malicious content, leading to initial system compromise.”
The project in itself is innocuous, but incorporates a malicious dependency in the form of a malicious Go module hosted on GitHub (e.g., uniroute), causing the infection sequence to be triggered once the project is executed. This includes first determining the operating system of the victim’s computer and delivering an appropriate next-stage payload (i.e., DownTroy) programmed in PowerShell (Windows), bash script (Linux), or AppleScript (macOS). Also deployed via DownTroy in the attacks targeting Windows are RooTroy, RealTimeTroy, a Go version of CosmicDoor, and Rust-based loader named Bof that’s used to decode and launch an encrypted shellcode payload stored in the “C:\Windows\system32" folder.</p>

<p>Overall Windows infection chain in GhostHire campaign
“Our research indicates a sustained effort by the actor to develop malware targeting both Windows and macOS systems, orchestrated through a unified command-and-control infrastructure,” Kaspersky said. “The use of generative AI has significantly accelerated this process, enabling more efficient malware development with reduced operational overhead.”
“The actor’s targeting strategy has evolved beyond simple cryptocurrency and browser credential theft. Upon gaining access, they conduct comprehensive data acquisition across a range of assets, including infrastructure, collaboration tools, note-taking applications, development environments, and communication platforms (messengers).”

<h2 id="why-early-threat-detection-is-a-must-for-long-term-business-growth"><a id="article-12"></a>Why Early Threat Detection Is a Must for Long-Term Business Growth</h2>

<p>In cybersecurity, speed isn’t just a win — it’s a multiplier. The faster you learn about emerging threats, the faster you adapt your defenses, the less damage you suffer, and the more confidently your business keeps scaling. Early threat detection isn’t about preventing a breach someday: it’s about protecting the revenue you’re supposed to earn every day. Companies that treat cybersecurity as a reactive cost center usually find themselves patching holes, paying ransoms, and dealing with downtime.</p>

<p>Companies that invest in proactive visibility, threat intelligence, and early detection mechanisms stay in the game longer. With trust, uptime, and innovation intact. Let’s break down why this strategy directly connects to long-term business success:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Early detection drastically lowers the cost of incidents
A breach caught at initial access might cost just internal response hours.</li>
</ol>

<p>Caught at data exfiltration — multiply the cost by 10, and a breach caught after regulatory violations kick in causes damage multiplied by 100+. Every malicious action not taken because you stopped the threat early equals:
No stolen
customer data
No recovery
downtime
eating your revenue
No brand-damaging
PR
nightmare
No
fines
from regulators
No expensive rebuild of
infrastructure
. Early detection keeps risks tiny — before they evolve into crises. 2.</p>

<p>Faster response = confident operations = competitive power
Business leaders care about ships sailing smoothly: new feature rollouts, customer onboarding, digital transformation — security must accelerate that, not block it. When SOC analysts receive enriched alerts and clear context instantly, decision-making shifts from:
“Do we even know what this is?” to “Here’s the threat and here’s the action — done.”
Security becomes a growth enabler, not a roadblock. Customers stick with companies that appear competent and trustworthy. 3.</p>

<p>A mature cyber posture unlocks serious business opportunities
As you scale, new markets require compliance and certifications. Want to sell to an international bank? Host global data? Expand your cloud footprint?</p>

<p>Proof of early detection capability becomes a contract requirement. Investors, partners, and enterprise clients love companies that can say: “We detect attacks early, and we can prove it.”
Security maturity = business expansion power. How Threat Intelligence Helps Achieve Early Detection
Threat intelligence is the strategic superpower that turns raw attack data into business protection and operational clarity. It shows
who
is attacking,
how
they operate, and
where
they strike next.</p>

<p>Most leaders already know TI helps SOC teams fight known malware faster, but its real potential is earlier threat detection. With continuous visibility into active global campaigns and instant context around suspicious signals, TI empowers organizations to predict attacks instead of reacting to breaches. That shift (from hindsight to foresight) is what creates resilient, unstoppable business growth. Every attack campaign leaves breadcrumbs: infrastructure reuse, TTP patterns, shared payloads.</p>

<p>Fresh cyber threat intelligence helps detect those signs before attackers succeed. Two solutions help businesses the most:

The bottom line
Attackers are now faster than ever, using automation, AI, and endless ingenuity. The only way to outpace them is by detecting earlier and reacting smarter.</p>

<p>And that’s exactly what Threat Intelligence Feeds + TI Lookup deliver:
Earlier visibility into active threats
Faster enrichment and triage of alerts
Stronger, more confident cyber posture
Reduced risk = sustained growth and customer trust. Early threat detection isn’t just a security outcome — it’s a business advantage. It paves your path to grow. It keeps your reputation intact.</p>

<p>It ensures today’s success becomes tomorrow’s stability. If your organization is ready to stop fearing threats and start anticipating them, it’s time to give your SOC the intelligence edge it deserves. Know sooner. Act smarter.</p>

<h2 id="is-your-google-workspace-as-secure-as-you-think-it-is"><a id="article-13"></a>Is Your Google Workspace as Secure as You Think it is?</h2>

<p>The New Reality for Lean Security Teams
If you’re the first security or IT hire at a fast-growing startup, you’ve likely inherited a mandate that’s both simple and maddeningly complex: secure the business without slowing it down. Most organizations using Google Workspace start with an environment built for collaboration, not resilience. Shared drives, permissive settings, and constant integrations make life easy for employees—and equally easy for attackers. The good news is that Google Workspace provides an excellent security foundation.</p>

<p>The challenge lies in properly configuring it, maintaining visibility, and closing the blind spots that Google’s native controls leave open. This article breaks down the key practices every security team—especially small, lean ones—should follow to harden Google Workspace and defend against modern cloud threats. 1. Lock Down the Basics
Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
MFA is the single most effective way to stop account compromise.</p>

<p>In the
Googl
e Admin console, go to:
Security → Authentication → 2-Step Verification
Set the policy to
“On for everyone”
. Require security keys (FIDO2) or Google’s prompt-based MFA instead of SMS codes. Enforce context-aware access for admins and executives—only allow logins from trusted networks or devices. Even with perfect phishing detection, stolen credentials are inevitable.</p>

<p>MFA makes them useless. Harden Admin Access
Admin accounts are a prime target. In
Admin Console → Directory → Roles
,
Limit the number of Super Admins to as few as possible. Assign role-based access—e.g.,
Groups Admin
,
Help Desk Admin
, or
User Management Admin
—instead of blanket privileges.</p>

<p>Turn on admin email alerts for privilege escalations or new role assignments. This ensures one compromised admin account doesn’t mean total compromise. Secure Sharing Defaults
Google’s collaboration tools are powerful—but their default sharing settings can be dangerous. Under
Apps → Google Workspace → Drive and Docs → Sharing Settings
:
Set “Link Sharing” to
Restricted
(internal only by default).</p>

<p>Prevent users from making files public unless explicitly approved. Disable “Anyone with the link” access for sensitive shared drives. Drive leaks rarely happen through malice—they happen through convenience. Tight defaults prevent accidental exposure.</p>

<p>Control OAuth App Access
Under
Security → Access and Data Control → API Controls
,
Review all third-party apps connected to Workspace under
App access control
. Block any app that requests
“Full access to Gmail”
,
“Drive read/write”
, or
“Directory access”
without a clear business case. Whitelist only trusted, vetted vendors. Compromised or poorly coded apps can become silent backdoors to your data.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Fortify Against Email Threats
Email remains the most targeted and exploited part of any organization’s cloud environment. While Google’s built-in phishing protection blocks a lot, it can’t always stop socially engineered or internally originated attacks—especially those leveraging compromised accounts. To improve resilience:
Turn on advanced phishing and malware protection:
In
Admin Console → Apps → Google Workspace → Gmail → Safety
, enable settings for
“Protect against inbound phishing, malware, spam, and domain impersonation”
and
“Detect unusual attachment types”
.</li>
</ol>

<p>Enable
“Protect against anomalous attachment behavior”
for Drive links embedded in emails. Enable DMARC, DKIM, and SPF
:
These three email authentication mechanisms ensure attackers can’t impersonate your domain. Set them up under
Apps → Google Workspace → Settings for Gmail → Authenticate Email
. Train your users—but back it up with automation
:
Phishing awareness helps, but human error is inevitable.</p>

<p>Layer detection and response tools that can identify suspicious internal messages, lateral phishing attempts, or malicious attachments that bypass Google’s filters. Email threats today move fast. Response speed—not just detection—is critical. 3.</p>

<p>Detect and Contain Account Takeovers
A compromised Google account can cascade quickly. Attackers can access shared Drives, steal OAuth tokens, and silently exfiltrate data. Proactive Monitoring
In the
Security Dashboard → Investigation Tool
, monitor for:
Sudden login attempts from new geolocations. Unusual download volumes from Drive.</p>

<p>Automatic forwarding rules that send mail externally. Automated Alerts
Set up automated alerts for:
Password resets without MFA challenge. Suspicious OAuth grants. Failed login bursts or credential stuffing activity.</p>

<p>Google’s alerts are helpful but limited. They don’t correlate across multiple accounts or detect subtle, slow-moving compromises. 4. Understand and Protect Your Data
It’s impossible to secure what you don’t understand.</p>

<p>Most organizations have years of unclassified, sensitive data buried in Drive and Gmail—financial models, customer data, source code, HR files. Data Discovery and DLP
While Google offers Data Loss Prevention (DLP), it’s rigid and often noisy. Under
Security → Data Protection
, you can:
Create rules for detecting patterns like credit card numbers, SSNs, or custom keywords. Apply them to Drive, Gmail, and Chat.</p>

<p>But beware of false positives and the administrative overhead of manual triage. Smarter Access and Governance
Enable Drive labels to classify sensitive content. Use context-aware access to require MFA or device trust for sensitive data. Monitor public link sharing with regular Drive audits.</p>

<p>When sensitive files are inevitably over-shared, automation—not manual cleanup—should handle it. 5. Balance Collaboration and Control
Google Workspace thrives because of its openness—but that openness can create silent exposure. To protect data without throttling productivity:
Enable Drive sharing alerts to notify users when sensitive data is shared externally.</p>

<p>Implement “justification workflows” where users must explain why they’re sharing outside the domain. Periodically revoke inactive user access and external file links. Security shouldn’t mean saying “no.” It should mean enabling safe collaboration by default. From Foundation to Fortress: Filling the Native Gaps
Even with every native control tuned, Google Workspace still has
blind spots
—because its tools were designed for collaboration first, and security second.</p>

<p>The Gaps:
Limited Context: Google sees events in isolation—one login anomaly or one shared file—but not the relationships between them. Reactive Response: Detection exists, but automated remediation is minimal. You’ll still rely heavily on manual triage. Data at Rest Blindness: Sensitive data buried in Gmail and Drive is unprotected once it’s stored, even though it’s often the highest-value target.</p>

<p>This is where Material Security transforms Workspace from a secure platform into a truly resilient one. How Material Extends Google Workspace Security
Email Security Beyond the Inbox
Material detects and
neutralizes sophisticated phishing
, internal impersonation, and BEC-style attacks that slip past Google’s filters. It uses relationship modeling to understand who your employees regularly communicate with and flags anomalies instantly. Automated playbooks handle remediation at machine speed—quarantining, removing, or flagging threats across inboxes in seconds.</p>

<p>Account Takeover Detection and Response
Material monitors a rich set of behavioral signals—forwarding rule changes, credential resets, unusual data access—to
detect compromised accounts early. Automated workflows isolate affected accounts, revoke tokens, and stop data exfiltration in real time. This transforms detection from hours to seconds, eliminating the long dwell times that make takeovers so damaging. Data Discovery and Protection at Scale
Material continuously scans Gmail and Drive to
identify sensitive data
