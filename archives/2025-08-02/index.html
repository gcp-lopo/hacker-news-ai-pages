<h2 id="cursor-ai-code-editor-fixed-flaw-allowing-attackers-to-run-commands-via-prompt-injection"><a id="article-1"></a>Cursor AI Code Editor Fixed Flaw Allowing Attackers to Run Commands via Prompt Injection</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a now-patched, high-severity security flaw in Cursor, a popular artificial intelligence (AI) code editor, that could result in remote code execution. The vulnerability, tracked as
CVE-2025-54135
(CVSS score: 8.6), has been addressed in
version 1.3
released on July 29, 2025. It has been codenamed CurXecute by Aim Labs, which previously disclosed
EchoLeak
. “Cursor runs with developer‑level privileges, and when paired with an MCP server that fetches untrusted external data, that data can redirect the agent’s control flow and exploit those privileges,” the Aim Labs Team
said
in a report shared with The Hacker News.</p>

<p>“By feeding poisoned data to the agent via MCP, an attacker can gain full remote code execution under the user privileges, and achieve any number of things, including opportunities for ransomware, data theft, AI manipulation and hallucinations, etc.”
In other words, the remote code execution triggered by a single externally‑hosted prompt‑injection that silently rewrites the “~/.cursor/mcp.json” file and runs attacker‑controlled commands. The vulnerability is similar to EchoLeak in that the tools, which are exposed by Model Control Protocol (MCP) servers for use by AI models and facilitate interaction with external systems, such as querying databases or invoking APIs, could fetch untrusted data that can poison the agent’s expected behavior. Specifically, Aim Security found that the
mcp.json file
used to configure custom MCP servers in Cursor can trigger the execution of any new entry (e.g., adding a Slack MCP server) without requiring any confirmation. This
auto-run mode
is particularly dangerous because it can lead to the automatic execution of a malicious payload that’s injected by the attacker via a Slack message.</p>

<p>The attack sequence proceeds as follows -
User adds Slack MCP server via Cursor UI
Attacker posts message in a public Slack channel with the command injection payload
Victim opens a new chat and asks Cursor’s agent to use the newly configured Slack MCP server to summarize their messages in a prompt: “Use Slack tools to summarize my messages”
The agent encounters a specially crafted message designed to inject malicious commands to its context
“The core cause of the flaw is that new entries to the global MCP JSON file are starting automatically,” Aim Security said. “Even if the edit is rejected, the code execution had already happened.”
The entire attack is noteworthy for its simplicity. But it also highlights how AI-assisted tools can open up new attack surfaces when processing external content, in this case, any third-party MCP server. “As AI agents keep bridging external, internal, and interactive worlds, security models must assume external context may affect the agent runtime - and monitor every hop,” the company added.</p>

<p>Version 1.3 of Cursor also addresses another issue with auto-run mode that can easily circumvent the platform’s denylist-based protections using methods like Base64-encoding, shell scripts, and enclosing shell commands within quotes (e.g., “e”cho bypass) to execute unsafe commands. Following responsible disclosure by the BackSlash Research Team, Cursor has taken the step of altogether deprecating the denylist feature for auto-run in favor of an allowlist. “Don’t expect the built-in security solutions provided by
vibe coding platforms
to be comprehensive or foolproof,” researchers Mustafa Naamneh and Micah Gold
said
. “The onus is on end-user organizations to ensure agentic systems are equipped with proper guardrails.”
The disclosure comes as HiddenLayer also found that Cursor’s ineffective denylist approach can be weaponized by embedding hidden malicious instructions with a GitHub README.md file, allowing an attacker to steal API keys, SSH credentials, and even run blocked system commands.</p>

<p>“When the victim viewed the project on GitHub, the prompt injection was not visible, and they asked Cursor to git clone the project and help them set it up, a common occurrence for an IDE-based agentic system,” researchers Kasimir Schulz, Kenneth Yeung, and Tom Bonner
noted
. “However, after cloning the project and reviewing the readme to see the instructions to set up the project, the prompt injection took over the AI model and forced it to use the grep tool to find any keys in the user’s workspace before exfiltrating the keys with curl.”
HiddenLayer said it also found additional weaknesses that could be abused to leak Cursor’s system prompt by overriding the base URL provided for OpenAI API requests to a proxied model, as well as exfiltrate a user’s private SSH keys by leveraging two benign tools, read_file and create_diagram, in what’s called a tool combination attack. This essentially involves inserting a prompt injection command within a GitHub README.md file that’s parsed by Cursor when the victim user asks the code editor to summarize the file, resulting in the execution of the command. The hidden instruction, for its part, uses the read_file tool to read private SSH keys belonging to the user and then utilizes the create_diagram tool to exfiltrate the keys to an attacker-controlled webhook.site URL.</p>

<p>All the identified shortcomings have been remediated by Cursor in version 1.3. News of various vulnerabilities in Cursor comes as Tracebit devised an attack targeting Google’s
Gemini CLI
, an open-source command-line tool fine-tuned for coding tasks, that exploited a default configuration of the tool to surreptitiously exfiltrate sensitive data to an attacker-controlled server using curl. Like observed in the case of Cursor, the attack requires the victim to (1) instruct Gemini CLI to interact with an attacker-created GitHub codebase containing a nefarious
indirect prompt injection
in the
GEMINI.md context file
and (2) add a benign command to an allowlist (e.g., grep). “Prompt injection targeting these elements, together with significant validation and display issues within Gemini CLI could cause undetectable arbitrary code execution,” Tracebit founder and CTO Sam Cox
said
.</p>

<p>To mitigate the risk posed by the attack, Gemini CLI users are advised to upgrade their installations to
version 0.1.14
shipped on July 25, 2025. Found this article interesting? Follow us on

<h2 id="attackers-use-fake-oauth-apps-with-tycoon-kit-to-breach-microsoft-365-accounts"><a id="article-2"></a>Attackers Use Fake OAuth Apps with Tycoon Kit to Breach Microsoft 365 Accounts</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have detailed a new cluster of activity where threat actors are impersonating enterprises with fake
Microsoft OAuth applications
to facilitate credential harvesting as part of account takeover attacks. “The fake Microsoft 365 applications impersonate various companies, including RingCentral, SharePoint, Adobe, and Docusign,” Proofpoint
said
in a Thursday report. The ongoing campaign, first detected in early 2025, is designed to use the OAuth applications as a gateway to obtain unauthorized access to users’ Microsoft 365 accounts by means of
phishing kits
like
Tycoon
and ODx that are capable of conducting multi-factor authentication (MFA) phishing. The enterprise security company said it observed the approach being used in email campaigns with more than 50 impersonated applications.</p>

<p>The attacks begin with phishing emails sent from compromised accounts and aim to trick recipients into clicking on URLs under the pretext of sharing requests for quotes (RFQ) or business contract agreements. Clicking on these links directs the victim to a Microsoft OAuth page for an application named “iLSMART” that asks them to grant it permissions to view their basic profile and maintain continued access to the data that they have been granted access to. What makes this attack notable is the impersonation of ILSMart, a legitimate online marketplace for aviation, marine, and defense industries to buy and sell parts and repair services. “The applications’ permissions would provide limited use to an attacker, but it is used for setting up the next stage of the attack,” Proofpoint said.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether the target accepted or denied the permissions requested, they are first redirected to a CAPTCHA page and then to a phony Microsoft account authentication page once the verification is complete. This fake Microsoft page makes use of adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) phishing techniques powered by the Tycoon Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS) platform to harvest the victim’s credentials and MFA codes. As recently as last month, Proofpoint said it detected another campaign impersonating Adobe in which the emails are sent via Twilio SendGrid, an email marketing platform, and are engineered with the same goal in mind: To gain user authorization or trigger a cancellation flow that redirects the victim to a phishing page. The campaign represents just a drop in the bucket when compared to overall Tycoon-related activity, with the multiple clusters leveraging the toolkit to perform account takeover attacks.</p>

<p>In 2025 alone, attempted account compromises affecting nearly 3,000 user accounts spanning more than 900 Microsoft 365 environments have been observed. “Threat actors are creating increasingly innovative attack chains in an attempt to bypass detections and obtain access to organizations globally,” the company said, adding it “anticipates threat actors will increasingly target users’ identity, with AiTM credential phishing becoming the criminal industry standard.”
As of last month, Microsoft has
announced
plans to update default settings to improve security by blocking legacy authentication protocols and requiring admin consent for third-party app access. The updates are expected to be completed by August 2025. “This update will have a positive impact on the landscape overall and will hamstring threat actors that use this technique,” Proofpoint pointed out.</p>

<p>The disclosure follows Microsoft’s
decision
to disable external workbook links to blocked file types by default between October 2025 and July 2026 in an attempt to enhance workbook security. The findings also come as spear-phishing emails bearing purported payment receipts are used to deploy by means of an AutoIt-based injector a piece of .NET malware called
VIP Keylogger
that can steal sensitive data from compromised hosts, Seqrite
said
. Over the course of several months, spam campaigns have been spotted concealing installation links to remote desktop software inside PDF files so as to bypass email and malware defenses. The campaign is believed to have been ongoing since November 2024, primarily targeting entities in France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and Germany.</p>

<p>“These PDFs are often disguised to look like invoices, contracts, or property listings to enhance credibility and lure victims into clicking the embedded link,” WithSecure
said
. “This design was intended to create the illusion of legitimate content that has been obscured, prompting the victim to install a program. In this case, the program was FleetDeck RMM.”
Other Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) tools deployed as part of the activity cluster include Action1, OptiTune, Bluetrait, Syncro, SuperOps, Atera, and ScreenConnect. “Although no post-infection payloads have been observed, the use of RMM tools strongly suggests their role as an initial access vector, potentially enabling further malicious activity,” the Finnish company added.</p>

<p>“Ransomware operators in particular have favoured this approach.”

<h2 id="ai-generated-malicious-npm-package-drains-solana-funds-from-1500-before-takedown"><a id="article-3"></a>AI-Generated Malicious npm Package Drains Solana Funds from 1,500+ Before Takedown</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have flagged a malicious npm package that was generated using artificial intelligence (AI) and concealed a cryptocurrency wallet drainer. The package, @kodane/patch-manager, claims to offer “advanced license validation and registry optimization utilities for high-performance Node.js applications.” It was uploaded to npm by a user named “Kodane” on July 28, 2025. The package is no longer available for download from the registry, but not before it attracted over 1,500 downloads. Software supply chain security company Safety, which
discovered
the library, said the malicious features are advertised directly in the source code, calling it an “enhanced stealth wallet drainer.”
Specifically, the behavior is triggered as part of a postinstall script that drops its payload within hidden directories across Windows, Linux, and macOS systems, and then proceeds to connect to a command-and-control (C2) server at “sweeper-monitor-production.up.railway[.]app.”
“The script generates a unique machine ID code for the compromised host and shares that with the C2 server,” Paul McCarty, head of research at Safety, said, noting that the C2 server lists two compromised machines.</p>

<p>In the npm ecosystem, postinstall scripts are often overlooked attack vectors—they run automatically after a package is installed, meaning users can be compromised without ever executing the package manually. This creates a dangerous blind spot, especially in CI/CD environments where dependencies are updated routinely without direct human review. The malware is designed to scan the system for the presence of a wallet file, and if found, it proceeds to drain all funds from the wallet to a hard-coded wallet address on the Solana blockchain. While this is not the first time
cryptocurrency drainers
have been
identified
in open-source repositories, what makes @kodane/patch-manager stand out are clues that suggest the use of Anthropic’s Claude AI chatbot to generate it.</p>

<p>This includes the presence of emojis, extensive JavaScript console logging messages, well-written and descriptive comments, the README.md markdown file written in a style that’s consistent with Claude-generated markdown files, and Claude’s pattern of calling code changes as “Enhanced.”
The discovery of the npm package highlights “how threat actors are leveraging AI to create more convincing and dangerous malware,” McCarty said. The incident also underlines growing concerns in software supply chain security, where AI-generated packages may bypass conventional defenses by appearing clean or even helpful. This raises the stakes for package maintainers and security teams, who now need to monitor not just known malware, but increasingly polished, AI-assisted threats that exploit trusted ecosystems like npm.

<h2 id="you-are-what-you-eat-why-your-ai-security-tools-are-only-as-strong-as-the-data-you-feed-them"><a id="article-5"></a>You Are What You Eat: Why Your AI Security Tools Are Only as Strong as the Data You Feed Them</h2>

<p>Just as triathletes know that peak performance requires more than expensive gear, cybersecurity teams are discovering that AI success depends less on the tools they deploy and more on the data that powers them
The junk food problem in cybersecurity
Imagine a triathlete who spares no expense on equipment—carbon fiber bikes, hydrodynamic wetsuits, precision GPS watches—but fuels their training with processed snacks and energy drinks. Despite the premium gear, their performance will suffer because their foundation is fundamentally flawed. Triathletes see nutrition as the fourth discipline of their training that can have a significant impact on performance and can even determine race outcomes. Today’s security operations centers (SOCs) face a similar issue.</p>

<p>They’re investing heavily in AI-powered detection systems, automated response platforms, and machine learning analytics—the equivalent of professional-grade triathlon equipment. But they’re powering these sophisticated tools with legacy data feeds that lack the richness and context modern AI models need to perform effectively. Just as a triathlete needs to master swimming, cycling, and running in seamless coordination, SOC teams must excel at detection, investigation, and response. However, without their own “fourth discipline,” SOC analysts will be working with sparse endpoint logs, fragmented alert streams, and data silos that don’t communicate, it’s like trying to complete a triathlon fueled only by a bag of chips and a beer—no matter how good your training or equipment, you’re not crossing the finish line first.</p>

<p>While you may load up on sugar and calories on race day to ensure you have the energy to make it through, that isn’t a sustainable, long-term regimen that will optimize your body for the best performance. The hidden cost of legacy data diets
“We’re living through the first wave of an AI revolution, and so far the spotlight has focused on models and applications,” said Greg Bell, Corelight chief strategy officer. “That makes sense, because the impacts for cyber defense are going to be huge. But I think there’s starting to be a dawning realization that ML and GenAI tools are gated by the quality of data they consume.”
This disconnect between advanced AI capabilities and outdated data infrastructure creates what security professionals are now calling “data debt”—the accumulated cost of building AI systems on foundations that weren’t designed for machine learning consumption.</p>

<p>Traditional security data often resembles a triathlete’s training diary filled with incomplete entries: “Ran today. Felt okay.” It provides basic information but lacks the granular metrics, environmental context, and performance correlations that enable genuine improvement. Legacy data feeds typically include:
Sparse endpoint logs
that capture events but miss the behavioral context
Alert-only feeds
that tell you something happened but not the full story
Siloed data sources
that can’t correlate across systems or time periods
Reactive indicators
that only activate after damage is already done without historical perspectives
Unstructured formats
that require extensive processing before AI models can analyze them
The adversary is already performance-enhanced
While defenders struggle with data that’s nutritionally deficient for AI consumption, attackers have optimized their approach with the discipline of elite athletes. They’re leveraging AI to create adaptive attack strategies that are faster, cheaper, and more precisely targeted than ever before by:
Automating reconnaissance
and exploit development to accelerate attack speed
Reducing the cost per attack
, increasing potential threat volume aster
Personalizing approaches
based on AI-gathered intelligence to deliver more targeted attacks
Generating quicker iteration
and improvement of tactics based on what is working
Meanwhile, many SOCs are still trying to defend against these AI-enhanced threats using data equivalent to a 1990s training regimen—with just basic heart rate information—when the competition is using comprehensive performance analytics, environmental sensors, and predictive modeling.</p>

<p>This creates an escalating performance gap. As attackers become more sophisticated in their use of AI, the quality of defensive data becomes increasingly critical. Poor data doesn’t just slow down detection—it actively undermines the effectiveness of AI security tools, creating blind spots that sophisticated adversaries can exploit. AI-ready data: the performance enhancement SOCs need
The solution lies in fundamentally reimagining security data architecture around what AI models actually need to perform effectively.</p>

<p>This means transitioning from legacy data feeds to what could be called “AI-ready” data—information that’s structured, enriched, and optimized specifically for AI analysis and automation. AI-ready data shares characteristics with the comprehensive performance metrics that elite triathletes use to optimize their training. Just as these athletes track everything from power output and cadence to environmental conditions and recovery markers, AI-ready security data captures not just what happened, but the full context surrounding each event. This includes network telemetry that provides visibility before encryption obscures the evidence, comprehensive metadata that reveals behavioral patterns, and structured formats that AI models can immediately process without extensive preprocessing.</p>

<p>It’s data that’s been specifically designed to feed the three critical components of AI-powered security operations. AI-driven threat detection
becomes dramatically more effective when powered by forensic-grade network evidence
that includes full context and real-time collection across on-premise, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments. This enables AI models to identify subtle patterns and anomalies that would be invisible in traditional log formats. AI workflows
transform the analyst experience by providing expert-authored processes enhanced with AI-driven payload analysis, historical context, and session-level summaries.</p>

<p>This is equivalent to having a world-class coach who can instantly analyze performance data and provide specific, actionable guidance for improvement. AI-enabled ecosystem integrations
ensure that AI-ready data flows seamlessly into existing SOC tools—SIEMs, SOAR platforms, XDR systems, and data lakes—without requiring custom integrations or format conversions. It’s automatically compatible with nearly every tool in an analyst’s arsenal. The compound effect of superior data
The impact of transitioning to AI-ready data creates a compound effect across security operations.</p>

<p>Teams can correlate unusual access patterns and privilege escalations in ephemeral cloud environments, critical for addressing cloud-native threats that traditional tools miss. They gain expanded coverage for novel, evasive, and zero-day threats while enabling faster development of new detections. Perhaps most importantly, analysts can quickly understand incident timelines without parsing raw logs, get plain-language summaries of suspicious behaviors across hosts and sessions, and focus their attention on priority alerts with clear justifications for why each incident matters. “High quality, context-rich data is the ‘clean fuel’ AI needs to achieve its full potential,” added Bell.</p>

<p>“Models starved of quality data will inevitably disappoint. As AI augmentation becomes the standard for both attack and defense, organizations that succeed will be the ones that understand a fundamental truth: in the world of AI security, you are what you eat.”
The training decision every SOC must make
As AI becomes standard for both attack and defense, AI-driven security tools can’t reach their potential without the right data. Organizations that continue feeding these systems with legacy data may find their significant investment in next-generation technology underperforming against increasingly advanced threats. Those that recognize this isn’t about replacing existing security investments — it’s about
providing them with the high-quality fuel
to deliver on their promise — will be positioned to unlock AI’s competitive advantage.</p>

<h2 id="storm-2603-deploys-dns-controlled-backdoor-in-warlock-and-lockbit-ransomware-attacks"><a id="article-7"></a>Storm-2603 Deploys DNS-Controlled Backdoor in Warlock and LockBit Ransomware Attacks</h2>

<p>The threat actor linked to the exploitation of the recently disclosed security flaws in Microsoft SharePoint Server is using a bespoke command-and-control (C2) framework called
AK47 C2
(also spelled ak47c2) in its operations. The framework includes at least two different types of clients, HTTP-based and Domain Name System (
DNS
)-based, which have been dubbed AK47HTTP and AK47DNS, respectively, by Check Point Research. The activity has been attributed to
Storm-2603
, which, according to Microsoft, is a suspected China-based threat actor that has leveraged the
SharePoint flaws
– CVE-2025-49706 and CVE-2025-49704 (aka ToolShell) – to deploy Warlock (aka X2anylock) ransomware. A previously unreported threat cluster, evidence gathered following an analysis of VirusTotal artifacts shows that the group may have been active since at least March 2025, deploying ransomware families like
LockBit Black
and Warlock together – something that’s not observed commonly among established e-crime groups.</p>

<p>“Based on VirusTotal data, Storm-2603 likely targeted some organizations in Latin America throughout the first half of 2025, in parallel to attacking organizations in APAC,” Check Point
said
. The attack tools used by the threat actor includes legitimate open-source and Windows utilities like masscan, WinPcap, SharpHostInfo, nxc, and PsExec, as well as a custom backdoor (“dnsclient.exe”) that uses DNS for command-and-control with the domain “update.updatemicfosoft[.]com.”
The backdoor is part of the AK47 C2 framework, alongside AK47HTTP, that’s employed to gather host information and parse DNS or HTTP responses from the server and execute them on the infected machine via “cmd.exe.” The initial access pathway used in these attacks are unknown. A point worth mentioning here is that the aforementioned infrastructure was also flagged by Microsoft as used by the threat actor as a C2 server to establish communication with the “spinstall0.aspx” web shell. In addition to the open-source tools, Storm-2603 has been found to distribute three additional payloads -
7z.exe and 7z.dll, the legitimate 7-Zip binary that’s used to sideload a malicious DLL, which delivers Warlock
bbb.msi, an installer that uses clink_x86.exe to sideload “clink_dll_x86.dll,” which leads to LockBit Black deployment
Check Point said it also discovered another MSI artifact uploaded to VirusTotal in April 2025 that’s used to launch Warlock and LockBit ransomware, and also drop a custom antivirus killer executable (“VMToolsEng.exe”) that employs the bring your own vulnerable driver (
BYOVD
) technique to
terminate security software
using ServiceMouse.sys, a third-party driver provided by Chinese security vendor Antiy Labs.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Storm-2603’s exact motivations remain unclear at this stage, making it harder to determine if it’s espionage-focused or driven by profit motives. However, it bears noting that there have been
instances
where nation-state actors from China, Iran, and North Korea have deployed ransomware on the side. “Storm-2603 leverages BYOVD techniques to disable endpoint defenses and DLL hijacking to deploy multiple ransomware families – blurring the lines between APT and criminal ransomware operations,” Check Point said. “The group also uses open-source tools like PsExec and masscan, signaling a hybrid approach seen increasingly in sophisticated attacks.”

<h2 id="secret-blizzard-deploys-malware-in-isp-level-aitm-attacks-on-moscow-embassies"><a id="article-8"></a>Secret Blizzard Deploys Malware in ISP-Level AitM Attacks on Moscow Embassies</h2>

<p>The Russian nation-state threat actor known as
Secret Blizzard
has been observed orchestrating a new cyber espionage campaign targeting foreign embassies located in Moscow by means of an adversary-in-the-middle (
AitM
) attack at the Internet Service Provider (ISP) level and delivering a custom malware dubbed ApolloShadow. “ApolloShadow has the capability to install a trusted root certificate to trick devices into trusting malicious actor-controlled sites, enabling Secret Blizzard to maintain persistence on diplomatic devices, likely for intelligence collection,” the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team
said
in a report shared with The Hacker News. The activity is assessed to be ongoing since at least 2024, with the campaign posing a security risk to diplomatic personnel relying on local ISPs or telecommunications services in Russia. Secret Blizzard (formerly Krypton), affiliated with the Russian Federal Security Service, is also tracked by the broader cybersecurity community under the monikers Blue Python, Iron Hunter, Pensive Ursa, Snake, SUMMIT, Uroburos, Turla, Venomous Bear, and Waterbug.</p>

<p>In December 2024, Microsoft and Lumen Technologies Black Lotus Labs
disclosed
the hacking group’s use of a Pakistan-based threat actor’s command-and-control (C2) infrastructure to carry out its own attacks as a way to cloud attribution efforts. The adversary has also been
observed
piggybacking on malware associated with other threat actors to deliver its Kazuar backdoor on target devices located in Ukraine. The Windows maker noted that the AitM position is likely facilitated by lawful intercept and includes the installation of root certificates under the guise of Kaspersky antivirus to obtain elevated access to the system. Initial access is achieved by redirecting target devices to threat actor-controlled infrastructure by putting them behind a
captive portal
, leading to the download and execution of the ApolloShadow malware.</p>

<p>“Once behind a captive portal, the Windows Test Connectivity Status Indicator is initiated—a legitimate service that determines whether a device has internet access by sending an HTTP GET request to hxxp://www.msftconnecttest[.]com/redirect, which should direct to msn[.]com,” Microsoft said. “Once the system opens the browser window to this address, the system is redirected to a separate actor-controlled domain that likely displays a certificate validation error, which prompts the target to download and execute ApolloShadow.”
The malware then beacons host information to the C2 server and runs a binary called CertificateDB.exe should the device not be running on default administrative settings, and retrieves as a second-stage payload an unknown Visual Basic Script. In the last step, the ApolloShadow process launches itself again and presents the user with a user access control (UAC) pop-up window and instructs them to grant it the highest privileges available to the user. ApolloShadow’s execution path varies if the running process is already running with sufficient elevated privileges, abusing them to set all networks to Private via registry profile changes and create an administrative user with the username UpdatusUser and a hard-coded password, allowing persistent access to the machine.</p>

<p>“This induces several changes, including allowing the host device to become discoverable, and relaxing firewall rules to enable file sharing,” the company said. “While we did not see any direct attempts for lateral movement, the main reason for these modifications is likely to reduce the difficulty of lateral movement on the network.”
Once this step is successfully completed, victims are displayed a window showing that the deployment of the digital certificates is in progress, causing two root certificates to be installed on the machine using the certutil utility. Also dropped is a file called “wincert.js” that allows Mozilla Firefox to trust the root certificates. To defend against Secret Blizzard activity, diplomatic entities operating in Moscow are urged to implement the principle of least privilege (PoLP), periodically review privileged groups, and route all traffic through an encrypted tunnel to a trusted network or use a virtual private network (VPN) service provider.</p>

<h2 id="experts-detect-multi-layer-redirect-tactic-used-to-steal-microsoft-365-login-credentials"><a id="article-9"></a>Experts Detect Multi-Layer Redirect Tactic Used to Steal Microsoft 365 Login Credentials</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a new phishing campaign that conceals malicious payloads by abusing link wrapping services from Proofpoint and Intermedia to bypass defenses. “Link wrapping is designed by vendors like Proofpoint to protect users by routing all clicked URLs through a scanning service, allowing them to block known malicious destinations at the moment of click,” the Cloudflare Email Security team
said
. “While this is effective against known threats, attacks can still succeed if the wrapped link hasn’t been flagged by the scanner at click time.”
The activity, observed over the last two months, once again illustrates how threat actors find different ways to
leverage legitimate features and trusted tools
to their advantage and perform malicious actions, in this case, redirecting victims to Microsoft 365 phishing pages. It’s noteworthy that the abuse of link wrapping involves the attackers gaining unauthorized access to email accounts that already use the feature within an organization, so that any email message containing a malicious URL sent from that account is automatically rewritten with the wrapped link (e.g., urldefense.proofpoint[.]com/v2/url?u=<malicious_website>).</malicious_website></p>

<p>Another important aspect concerns what Cloudflare calls “multi-tiered redirect abuse,” in which the threat actors first cloak their malicious links using a URL shortening service like Bitly, and then send the shortened link in an email message via a Proofpoint-secured account, causing it to be obscured a second time. This behavior effectively creates a redirection chain, where the URL passes through two levels of obfuscation – Bitly and Proofpoint’s URL Defense – before taking the victim to the phishing page. In the attacks observed by the web infrastructure company, the phishing messages masquerade as voicemail notifications, urging recipients to click on a link to listen to them, ultimately directing them to a bogus Microsoft 365 phishing page designed to capture their credentials. Alternate infection chains employ the same technique in emails that notify users of a supposed document received on Microsoft Teams and trick them into clicking on booby-trapped hyperlinks.</p>

<p>A third variation of these attacks impersonates Teams in emails, claiming that they have unread messages and that they can click on the “Reply in Teams” button embedded in the messages to redirect them to credential harvesting pages. “By cloaking malicious destinations with legitimate urldefense[.]proofpoint[.]com and url[.]emailprotection URLs, these phishing campaigns’ abuse of trusted link wrapping services significantly increases the likelihood of a successful attack,” Cloudflare said. When contacted by The Hacker News for comment, Proofpoint said it’s aware of threat actors abusing URL redirects and URL protection in ongoing phishing campaigns, and that it’s a technique the company has observed from multiple security service providers who provide similar email protection or URL rewrite solutions, such as Cisco and Sophos. The enterprise security firm also noted that it flags these campaigns via its behavioral artificial intelligence (AI) detection engine, and messages bearing such URLs are discarded and the final URLs at the end of the redirect chain are blocked to prevent exploitation.</p>

<p>“In these campaigns, a threat actor can either abuse an open redirect to link to a rewritten URL, or compromise an email account that belongs to someone with some type of email protection,” Proofpoint threat researchers said. “Then, they send an email with a phishing link to the account they have compromised. The security service rewrites the URL, and the threat actor makes sure the link is not blocked. Then, the threat actor will take the rewritten URL and include it in various redirect chains.”
“Whenever threat actors choose to use a re-written URL from any security service, including Proofpoint, it means that as soon as the security service blocks the final URL, the entire attack chain will be blocked for every recipient of the campaign, whether the recipient was a customer of the security service or not.”
The development comes amid a
spike
in
phishing
attacks
that
weaponize
Scalable Vector Graphics (
SVG
) files to
get around
traditional anti-spam and anti-phishing protections and initiate multi-stage malware infections.</p>

<p>“Unlike JPEG or PNG files, SVG files are written in XML and support JavaScript and HTML code,” the New Jersey Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Cell (NJCCIC)
said
last month. “They can contain scripts, hyperlinks, and interactive elements, which can be exploited by embedding malicious code within harmless SVG files.”
Phishing campaigns have also been observed embedding fake Zoom videoconferencing links in emails that, when clicked, trigger a redirection chain to a fake page that mimics a realistic-looking interface, after which they are served a “meeting connection timed out” message and taken to a phishing page that prompts them to enter their credentials to rejoin the meeting. “Unfortunately, instead of ‘rejoining,’ the victim’s credentials along with their IP address, country, and region are exfiltrated via Telegram, a messaging app notorious for ‘secure, encrypted communications,’ and inevitably sent to the threat actor,” Cofense
said
in a recent report. (The story was updated after publication to include a response from Proofpoint.)

<h2 id="n-korean-hackers-used-job-lures-cloud-account-access-and-malware-to-steal-millions-in-crypto"><a id="article-10"></a>N. Korean Hackers Used Job Lures, Cloud Account Access, and Malware to Steal Millions in Crypto</h2>

<p>The North Korea-linked threat actor known as
UNC4899
has been attributed to attacks targeting two different organizations by approaching their employees via LinkedIn and Telegram. “Under the guise of freelance opportunities for software development work, UNC4899 leveraged social engineering techniques to successfully convince the targeted employees to execute malicious Docker containers in their respective workstations,” Google’s cloud division
said
[PDF] in its Cloud Threat Horizons Report for H2 2025. UNC4899
overlaps
with activity tracked under the monikers Jade Sleet, PUKCHONG, Slow Pisces, and TraderTraitor. Active since at least 2020, the state-sponsored actor is known for its targeting of cryptocurrency and blockchain industries.</p>

<p>Notably, the hacking group has been implicated in
significant cryptocurrency heists
, including that of Axie Infinity in March 2022 ($625 million), DMM Bitcoin in May 2024 ($308 million), and Bybit in February 2025 ($1.4 billion). Another example that highlights its sophistication is the suspected exploitation of
JumpCloud’s infrastructure
to target downstream customers within the cryptocurrency vertical. According to DTEX, TraderTraitor is affiliated with the Third Bureau (or Department) of North Korea’s Reconnaissance General Bureau and is the most prolific of any of the Pyongyang hacking groups when it comes to cryptocurrency theft. Attacks mounted by the threat actor have entailed leveraging job-themed lures or
uploading malicious npm packages
, and then approaching employees at target companies with a lucrative opportunity or asking them to collaborate on a GitHub project that would then lead to the execution of the rogue npm libraries.</p>

<p>“TraderTraitor has demonstrated a sustained interest in cloud-centric and cloud-adjacent attack surfaces, often with a final goal of compromising companies that are customers of cloud platforms rather than the platforms themselves,” cloud security firm Wiz
said
in a detailed report of TraderTraitor this week. The attacks observed by Google Cloud targeted the respective organizations’ Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services (AWS) environments, paving the way for a downloader called GLASSCANNON that’s then used to serve backdoors like PLOTTWIST and MAZEWIRE that can establish connections with an attacker-controlled server. In the incident involving the Google Cloud environment, the threat actors have been found to employ stolen credentials to interact remotely using Google Cloud CLI over an anonymous VPN service, carrying out extensive reconnaissance and credential theft activities. However, they were thwarted in their efforts due to the multi-factor authentication (MFA) configuration applied to the victim’s credentials.</p>

<p>“UNC4899 eventually determined the victim’s account had administrative privileges to the Google Cloud project and disabled the MFA requirements,” Google said. “After successfully gaining access to the targeted resources, they immediately re-enabled MFA to evade detection.”
The intrusion targeting the second victim’s AWS environment is said to have followed a similar playbook, only this time the attackers used long-term access keys obtained from an
AWS credential file
to interact remotely via AWS CLI. Although the threat actors ran into access control roadblocks that prevented them from performing any sensitive actions, Google said it found evidence that likely indicated the theft of the user’s session cookies. These cookies were then used to identify relevant CloudFront configurations and S3 buckets.</p>

<p>UNC4899 “leveraged the inherent administrative permissions applied to their access to upload and replace existing JavaScript files with those containing malicious code, which were designed to manipulate cryptocurrency functions and trigger a transaction with the cryptocurrency wallet of a target organization,” Google said. The attacks, in both cases, ended with the threat actors successfully withdrawing several million worth of cryptocurrency, the company added. The development comes as Sonatype said it flagged and blocked 234 unique malware npm and PyPI packages attributed to North Korea’s Lazarus Group between January and July 2025. Some of these libraries are configured to drop a known credential stealer referred to as
BeaverTail
, which is associated with a long-running campaign dubbed Contagious Interview.</p>

<p>“These packages mimic popular developer tools but function as espionage implants, designed to steal secrets, profile hosts, and open persistent backdoors into critical infrastructure,” the software supply chain security firm
said
. “The surge of activity in H1 2025 demonstrates a strategic pivot: Lazarus is now embedding malware directly into open source package registries, namely npm and PyPI, at an alarming rate.”

<h2 id="ai-driven-trends-in-endpoint-security-what-the-2025-gartner-magic-quadrant-reveals"><a id="article-11"></a>AI-Driven Trends in Endpoint Security: What the 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ Reveals</h2>

<p>Cyber threats and attacks like ransomware continue to increase in volume and complexity with the endpoint typically being the most sought after and valued target. With the rapid expansion and adoption of AI, it is more critical than ever to ensure the endpoint is adequately secured by a platform capable of not just keeping pace, but staying ahead of an ever-evolving threat landscape. SentinelOne’s steadfast commitment to delivering AI-powered cybersecurity enables global customers and partners to achieve resiliency and reduce risk with real-time, autonomous protection across the entire enterprise — all from a single agent and console with a robust, rigorously tested platform that keeps the customer in control. Cybersecurity today isn’t just about detection—it’s about operational continuity under pressure.</p>

<p>For example, endpoint solutions must account for encrypted traffic inspection, policy enforcement during identity compromise, and fast containment across distributed environments. These capabilities are especially critical in industries like healthcare or finance, where seconds can mean regulatory penalties or breached patient records. Gartner recently named SentinelOne a Leader in the
2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant for Endpoint Protection Platforms
for the fifth consecutive year. This recognition builds on the Singularity Platform’s momentum in innovation as the first solution with an AI analyst and the first unified platform delivering EDR, CNAPP, Hyperautomation, and SIEM to be FedRAMP High (the highest level of U.S.</p>

<p>federal cloud security authorization) Authorized. SentinelOne provides protection for organizations of all sizes—from small businesses to global governments and enterprises—meeting their unique needs in the face of an increasingly complex cyber landscape. The Singularity Platform secures organizations across any device, any OS, and any cloud, providing industry-leading signal-to-noise so SOC teams can focus on responding as quickly as possible. With advanced XDR, AI SIEM, and CNAPP capabilities, a lightweight agent, and responsible architecture, SentinelOne offers a solution designed for both security and operational resiliency.</p>

<p>Organizations using
Singularity Endpoint and Purple AI detect threats 63% faster, reduce MTTR by 55%
, and lower the likelihood of a security incident by 60%. Customers have reported a 338% ROI over three years, maximizing the value of their security investments while strengthening their endpoint security. For example, a healthcare provider using SentinelOne reported cutting incident response time by over 50% during a phishing-induced ransomware outbreak, thanks to automated rollback and unified visibility across cloud workloads and endpoints. Many teams searching for EDR or XDR platforms are trying to answer: “Will this reduce alert fatigue?” or “Can it integrate with my SIEM or SOAR stack without more overhead?” This is where automation must go beyond buzzwords—reducing manual triage, stitching disconnected signals, and working with existing tools instead of replacing them.</p>

<p>SentinelOne has set the standard in modern endpoint protection since entering the market more than a decade ago, disrupting both traditional antivirus and early next-gen AV approaches. Unlike signature-based protection and cloud-dependent defenses, the platform pioneered the use of static and behavioral AI and machine learning to detect even novel techniques, solve for both online and air-gapped environments, and automate response. These innovations differentiate SentinelOne from traditional AV and even next-gen EDR solutions, offering deeper automation and on-device intelligence compared to competitors that rely heavily on cloud lookups or manual workflows. This innovation, architecture, and design philosophy continues to evolve through Purple AI, advanced behavioral detection models, automated remediation and rollback, XDR capabilities, and more.</p>

<p>The security platform now offers solutions spanning Identity, Cloud, AI SIEM, Hyperautomation, expert-managed detection and response, and a range of threat services. Accelerating the SOC and staying ahead of attacks in the age of AI requires platforms that harness innovation in AI and automation to radically improve detection, triage, and response. SentinelOne’s platform has long embedded AI and automation as a foundational element. The company continues to develop accessible, compliant AI and automation to transform the SOC.</p>

<p>Behavioral AI and the Future of Cyber Threat Detection
Over the last decade, SentinelOne has advanced behavioral AI detections, automated remediation, and introduced agentic AI for security. Rather than merely assisting analysts, agentic AI—defined as a class of autonomous AI systems capable of initiating and executing security actions without human prompting—autonomously takes action, handles routine tasks, and accelerates decision making while keeping the human operator in control. Purple AI, the platform’s AI security analyst
, translates natural language questions into powerful threat hunting queries, suggests follow-up questions, recommends next steps, and generates reports and email summaries to accelerate remediation. Built on the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF), a vendor-agnostic standard for unifying data models, Purple AI ensures unified visibility across all security data, enabling fast, precise threat detection.</p>

<p>Figure 2: A natural language query using Purple AI to hunt for Privilege Escalation activity
This capability is integrated into Singularity Complete, SentinelOne’s EDR solution, positioning Purple AI as a transformative force in SOC operations. By combining human insight with AI-level reasoning and automation, it enables faster, more accurate triage, investigation, threat management, and response. How Endpoint Security Has Evolved in the Age of AI
Product innovation remains central to SentinelOne’s strategy, driven by customer feedback, cost and time savings, and deep integration of AI and automation. Detects suspicious and malicious patterns in real time using behavioral and static AI models across servers, workstations, and workloads

Enables custom workflows and incident response via Singularity Hyperautomation’s no-code, drag-and-drop canvas
SentinelOne also plays a central role in Zero Trust architectures, supporting identity-based segmentation and continuous trust evaluation across cloud, hybrid, and air-gapped environments.</p>

<p>By aligning with frameworks like MITRE ATT&amp;CK, OCSF, and NIST 800-207, the platform enables cohesive telemetry correlation and policy enforcement—positioning it as more than just endpoint protection, but a pillar in enterprise-wide cyber resilience. Balancing Control and Stability in Modern Cybersecurity Platforms
The Singularity Platform delivers simplicity, stability, and ease of use across various deployment environments—on-premises, hybrid, air-gapped, or fully cloud-based. SentinelOne offers comprehensive OS support, including legacy systems such as Windows XP, 2008, and 2012, and spans more than 20 years of Windows Server coverage. Customer control is a cornerstone of the platform’s philosophy.</p>

<p>The multi-tenant management console emphasizes analyst experience, with streamlined deployment, configuration, and management. Updates are rigorously tested, responsibly deployed, and controlled by the customer to ensure stability and autonomy. As recognized by Gartner in this year’s evaluation, the unified agent and intuitive console deliver deep enterprise visibility while reducing overhead and administrative burden, allowing security teams to focus on high-priority tasks. Earning Industry Trust Through Proven Performance
SentinelOne continues to lead in endpoint cybersecurity, earning trust from nearly 15,000 customers—including Fortune 10, Fortune 500, Global 2000 companies, and major government agencies.</p>

<p>The company consistently achieves top results in MITRE ATT&amp;CK Enterprise Evaluations, delivering an industry-leading signal-to-noise ratio. In addition to being named a Leader in the

<h2 id="unc2891-breaches-atm-network-via-4g-raspberry-pi-tries-caketap-rootkit-for-fraud"><a id="article-12"></a>UNC2891 Breaches ATM Network via 4G Raspberry Pi, Tries CAKETAP Rootkit for Fraud</h2>

<p>The financially motivated threat actor known as
UNC2891
has been observed targeting Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) infrastructure using a 4G-equipped Raspberry Pi as part of a covert attack. The cyber-physical attack involved the adversary leveraging their physical access to install the Raspberry Pi device and have it connected directly to the same network switch as the ATM, effectively placing it within the target bank’s network, Group-IB said. It’s currently not known how this access was obtained. “The Raspberry Pi was equipped with a 4G modem, allowing remote access over mobile data,” security researcher Nam Le Phuong
said
in a Wednesday report.</p>

<p>“Using the TINYSHELL backdoor, the attacker established an outbound command-and-control (C2) channel via a Dynamic DNS domain. This setup enabled continuous external access to the ATM network, completely bypassing perimeter firewalls and traditional network defenses.”
UNC2891 was
first documented
by Google-owned Mandiant in March 2022, linking the group to attacks targeting ATM switching networks to carry out unauthorized cash withdrawals at different banks using fraudulent cards. Central to the operation was a kernel module rootkit dubbed CAKETAP that’s designed to hide network connections, processes, and files, as well as intercept and spoof card and PIN verification messages from hardware security modules (HSMs) to enable financial fraud. The hacking crew is assessed to share tactical overlaps with another threat actor called
UNC1945
(aka LightBasin), which was previously identified compromising managed service providers and striking targets within the financial and professional consulting industries.</p>

<p>Describing the threat actor as possessing extensive knowledge of Linux and Unix-based systems, Group-IB said its analysis uncovered backdoors named “lightdm” on the victim’s network monitoring server that are designed to establish active connections to the Raspberry Pi and the internal Mail Server. The attack is significant for the abuse of
bind mounts
to
hide the presence
of the backdoor from process listings and evade detection. The end goal of the infection, as seen in the past, is to deploy the CAKETAP rootkit on the ATM switching server and facilitate fraudulent ATM cash withdrawals. However, the Singaporean company said the campaign was disrupted before the threat actor could inflict any serious damage.</p>

<p>“Even after the Raspberry Pi was discovered and removed, the attacker maintained internal access through a backdoor on the mail server,” Group-IB said. “The threat actor leveraged a Dynamic DNS domain for command-and-control.”

<h2 id="alert-fatigue-data-overload-and-the-fall-of-traditional-siems"><a id="article-13"></a>Alert Fatigue, Data Overload, and the Fall of Traditional SIEMs</h2>

<p>Security Operations Centers (SOCs)
are stretched to their limits. Log volumes are surging, threat landscapes are growing more complex, and security teams are chronically understaffed. Analysts face a daily battle with alert noise, fragmented tools, and incomplete data visibility. At the same time, more vendors are phasing out their on-premises SIEM solutions, encouraging migration to SaaS models.</p>

<p>But this transition often amplifies the inherent flaws of traditional SIEM architectures. T
he Log Deluge Meets Architectural Limits
SIEMs are built to process log data—and the more, the better, or so the theory goes. In modern infrastructures, however, log-centric models are becoming a bottleneck. Cloud systems, OT networks, and dynamic workloads generate exponentially more telemetry, often redundant, unstructured, or in unreadable formats.</p>

<p>SaaS-based SIEMs in particular face financial and technical constraints: pricing models based on events per second (EPS) or flows-per-minute (FPM) can drive exponential cost spikes and overwhelm analysts with thousands of irrelevant alerts. Further limitations include protocol depth and flexibility. Modern cloud services like Azure AD frequently update log signature parameters, and static log collectors often miss these changes—leaving blind spots. In OT environments, proprietary protocols like Modbus or BACnet defy standard parsers, complicating or even preventing effective detection.</p>

<p>False Positives: More Noise, Less Security
Up to 30% of a SOC analyst’s time is lost chasing false positives. The root cause? Lack of context. SIEMs can correlate logs, but they don’t “understand” them.</p>

<p>A privileged login could be legitimate—or a breach. Without behavioral baselines or asset context, SIEMs either miss the signal or sound the alarm unnecessarily. This leads to analyst fatigue and slower incident response times. The SaaS SIEM Dilemma: Compliance, Cost, and Complexity
While SaaS-based SIEMs are marketed as a natural evolution, they often fall short of their on-prem predecessors in practice.</p>

<p>Key gaps include incomplete parity in rule sets, integrations, and sensor support. Compliance issues add complexity, especially for finance, industry, or public sector organizations where data residency is non-negotiable. And then there’s cost. Unlike appliance-based models with fixed licensing, SaaS SIEMs charge by data volume.</p>

<p>Every incident surge becomes a billing surge—precisely when SOCs are under maximum stress. Modern Alternatives: Metadata and Behavior Over Logs
Modern detection platforms focus on metadata analysis and behavioral modeling rather than scaling log ingestion. Network flows (NetFlow, IPFIX), DNS requests, proxy traffic, and authentication patterns can all reveal critical anomalies like lateral movement, abnormal cloud access, or compromised accounts without inspecting payloads. These platforms operate without agents, sensors, or mirrored traffic.</p>

<p>They extract and correlate existing telemetry, applying adaptive machine learning in real time—an approach already embraced by newer, lightweight
Network Detection &amp; Response (NDR)
solutions purpose-built for hybrid IT and OT environments. The result is fewer false positives, sharper alerts, and significantly less pressure on analysts. A New SOC Blueprint: Modular, Resilient, Scalable
The slow decline of traditional SIEMs signals the need for structural change. Modern SOCs are modular, distributing detection across specialized systems and decoupling analytics from centralized logging architectures.</p>

<p>By integrating flow-based detection and behavior analytics into the stack, organizations gain both resilience and scalability—allowing analysts to focus on strategic tasks like triage and response
. Conclusion
Classic SIEMs—whether on-prem or SaaS—are relics of a past that equated log volume with security. Today, success lies in smarter data selection, contextual processing, and intelligent automation. Metadata analytics, behavioral modeling, and machine-learning-based detection are not just technically superior—they represent a new operational model for the SOC.</p>

<h2 id="hackers-exploit-critical-wordpress-theme-flaw-to-hijack-sites-via-remote-plugin-install"><a id="article-14"></a>Hackers Exploit Critical WordPress Theme Flaw to Hijack Sites via Remote Plugin Install</h2>

<p>Threat actors are actively exploiting a critical security flaw in “
Alone – Charity Multipurpose Non-profit WordPress Theme
“ to take over susceptible sites. The vulnerability, tracked as
CVE-2025-5394
, carries a CVSS score of 9.8. Security researcher Thái An has been credited with discovering and reporting the bug. According to Wordfence, the shortcoming relates to an arbitrary file upload affecting all versions of the plugin prior to and including 7.8.3.</p>

<p>It has been addressed in version 7.8.5 released on June 16, 2025. CVE-2025-5394 is rooted in a plugin installation function named “alone_import_pack_install_plugin()” and stems from a missing capability check, thereby allowing unauthenticated users to deploy arbitrary plugins from remote sources via AJAX and achieve code execution. “This vulnerability makes it possible for an unauthenticated attacker to upload arbitrary files to a vulnerable site and achieve remote code execution, which is typically leveraged for a complete site takeover,” Wordfence’s István Márton
said
. Evidence shows that CVE-2025-5394 began to be exploited starting July 12, two days before the vulnerability was publicly disclosed.</p>
