<h2 id="socgholish-malware-spread-via-ad-tools-delivers-access-to-lockbit-evil-corp-and-others"><a id="article-1"></a>SocGholish Malware Spread via Ad Tools; Delivers Access to LockBit, Evil Corp, and Others</h2>

<p>The threat actors behind the SocGholish malware have been observed leveraging Traffic Distribution Systems (TDSs) like
Parrot TDS and Keitaro TDS
to filter and redirect unsuspecting users to sketchy content. “The core of their operation is a sophisticated Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) model, where infected systems are sold as initial access points to other cybercriminal organizations,” Silent Push
said
in an analysis. SocGholish, also called FakeUpdates, is a
JavaScript loader malware
that’s distributed via compromised websites by masquerading as deceptive updates for web browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, as well as other software such as Adobe Flash Player or Microsoft Teams. It’s attributed to a threat actor called TA569, which is also tracked as Gold Prelude, Mustard Tempest, Purple Vallhund, and UNC1543.</p>

<p>Attack chains involve deploying SocGholish to establish initial access and broker that compromised system access to a diverse clientele, including Evil Corp (aka DEV-0243), LockBit, Dridex, and
Raspberry Robin
(aka Roshtyak). Interestingly, recent campaigns have also leveraged Raspberry Robin as a distribution vector for SocGholish. “SocGholish infections typically originate from compromised websites that have been infected in multiple different ways,” Silent Push said. “Website infections can involve direct injections, where the SocGholish payload delivery injects JS directly loaded from an infected webpage or via a version of the direct injection that uses an intermediate JS file to load the related injection.”
Besides redirecting to SocGholish domains via compromised websites, another primary source of traffic involves using third-party TDSes like Parrot TDS and Keitaro TDS to direct web traffic to specific websites or to landing pages after performing extensive fingerprinting of the site visitor and determining if they are of interest based on certain predefined criteria.</p>

<p>Keitaro TDS has long been involved in threat activity going beyond
malvertising and scams
to deliver more sophisticated malware, including
exploit kits
,
loaders
,
ransomware
, and
Russian influence operations
. Last year, Infoblox revealed how SocGholish, a
VexTrio
partner, used Keitaro to redirect victims to
VexTrio’s TDSes
. “Because Keitaro also has many legitimate applications, it is frequently difficult or impossible to simply block traffic through the service without generating excessive false positives, although organizations can consider this in their own policies,” Proofpoint
noted
back in 2019. Keitaro TDS is believed to be connected to
TA2726
, which has functioned as a traffic provider for both SocGholish and TA2727 by compromising websites and injecting a Keitaro TDS link, and then selling that to its customers.</p>

<p>“The intermediate C2 [command-and-control] framework dynamically generates payloads that victims download at runtime,” Silent Push noted. “It is essential to note that across the execution framework, from the initial SocGholish injection to the on-device execution of the Windows implant, the entire process is continuously tracked by SocGholish’s C2 framework. If, at any time, the framework determines that a given victim is not ‘legitimate,’ it will stop the serving of a payload.”
The cybersecurity company has also assessed that there are possibly former members who are involved in Dridex, Raspberry Robin, and SocGholish, given the
overlapping
nature
of the campaigns observed. The development comes as Zscaler detailed an updated version of Raspberry Robin that features improved obfuscation methods, changes to its network communication process, and embeds pointing to intentionally corrupted TOR C2 domains, signaling continued efforts to avoid detection and hinder reverse engineering efforts.</p>

<p>“The network encryption algorithm has changed from AES (CTR mode) to Chacha-20,” the company
said
. “Raspberry Robin has added a new local privilege escalation (LPE) exploit (
CVE-2024-38196
) to gain elevated privileges on targeted systems.”
The disclosure also follows an evolution of
DarkCloud Stealer attacks
that employ phishing emails to deliver a ConfuserEx-protected version of the stealer payload written in Visual Basic 6, which is launched and executed using a technique called process hollowing. “DarkCloud Stealer is typical of an evolution in cyberthreats, leveraging obfuscation techniques and intricate payload structures to evade traditional detection mechanisms,” Unit 42
said
. “The shift in delivery methods observed in April 2025 indicates an evolving evasion strategy.”

<h2 id="webinar-how-to-stop-python-supply-chain-attacksand-the-expert-tools-you-need"><a id="article-2"></a>Webinar: How to Stop Python Supply Chain Attacks—and the Expert Tools You Need</h2>

<p>Python is everywhere in modern software. From machine learning models to production microservices, chances are your code—and your business—depends on Python packages you didn’t write. But in 2025, that trust comes with a serious risk. Every few weeks, we’re seeing fresh headlines about malicious packages uploaded to the Python Package Index (PyPI)—many going undetected until after they’ve caused real harm.</p>

<p>One of the most dangerous recent examples? In December 2024, attackers quietly compromised the Ultralytics YOLO package, widely used in computer vision applications. It was downloaded thousands of times before anyone noticed. This wasn’t an isolated event.</p>

<p>This is the new normal. Python supply chain attacks are rising fast—and your next pip install could be the weakest link. Join our webinar to learn what’s really happening, what’s coming next, and how to secure your code with confidence. Don’t wait for a breach.</p>

<p>Watch this webinar now and take control. . What’s Really Going On? Attackers are exploiting weak links in the open-source supply chain.</p>

<p>They’re using tricks like:
Typo-squatting:
Uploading fake packages with names like requessts or urlib. Repojacking:
Hijacking abandoned GitHub repos once linked to trusted packages. Slop-squatting:
Publishing popular misspellings
before
a legit maintainer claims them. Once a developer installs one of these packages—intentionally or not—it’s game over.</p>

<p>And it’s not just rogue packages. Even the official Python container image ships with critical vulnerabilities. At the time of writing, there are over 100 high and critical CVEs in the standard Python base image. Fixing them isn’t easy, either.</p>

<p>That’s the “my boss told me to fix Ubuntu” problem—when your app team inherits infra problems no one wants to own. It’s Time to Treat Python Supply Chain Security Like a First-Class Problem
The traditional approach—”just pip install and move on”—won’t cut it anymore. Whether you’re a developer, a security engineer, or running production systems, you need visibility and control over what you’re pulling in. And here’s the good news: you can secure your Python environment without breaking your workflow.</p>

<p>You just need the right tools, and a clear playbook. That’s where this webinar comes in. 🎥Join Us:
How to Secure Your Python Supply Chain in 2025
In this session, we’ll walk through:
The Anatomy of Modern Python Supply Chain Attacks:
What happened in recent PyPI incidents—and why they keep happening. What You Can Do Today:
From pip install hygiene to using tools like pip-audit, Sigstore, and SBOMs.</p>

<p>Behind the Scenes: Sigstore &amp; SLSA:
How modern signing and provenance frameworks are changing how we trust code. How PyPI is Responding:
The latest ecosystem-wide changes and what they mean for package consumers. Zero-Trust for Your Python Stack:
Using Chainguard Containers and Chainguard Libraries to ship secure, CVE-free code out of the box. The threats are getting smarter.</p>

<p>The tooling is getting better. But most teams are stuck somewhere in the middle—relying on default images, no validation, and hoping their dependencies don’t betray them. You don’t have to become a security expert overnight—but you do need a roadmap. Whether you’re early in your journey or already doing audits and signing, this session will help you take your Python supply chain to the next level.</p>

<h2 id="malicious-go-npm-packages-deliver-cross-platform-malware-trigger-remote-data-wipes"><a id="article-3"></a>Malicious Go, npm Packages Deliver Cross-Platform Malware, Trigger Remote Data Wipes</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a set of 11 malicious Go packages that are designed to download additional payloads from remote servers and execute them on both Windows and Linux systems. “At runtime the code silently spawns a shell, pulls a second-stage payload from an interchangeable set of .icu and .tech command-and-control (C2) endpoints, and executes it in memory,” Socket security researcher Olivia Brown
said
. The list of identified packages is below -
github.com/stripedconsu/linker
github.com/agitatedleopa/stm
github.com/expertsandba/opt
github.com/wetteepee/hcloud-ip-floater
github.com/weightycine/replika
github.com/ordinarymea/tnsr_ids
github.com/ordinarymea/TNSR_IDS
github.com/cavernouskina/mcp-go
github.com/lastnymph/gouid
github.com/sinfulsky/gouid
github.com/briefinitia/gouid
The packages conceal an obfuscated loader that harbors functionality to fetch second-stage ELF and portable executable (PE) binaries, which, in turn, can gather host information, access web browser data, and beacon out to its C2 server. “Because the second-stage payload delivers a bash-scripted payload for Linux systems and retrieves Windows executables via certutil.exe, both Linux build servers and Windows workstations are susceptible to compromise,” Brown said.</p>

<p>Complicating matters is the decentralized nature of the Go ecosystem, which allows modules to be directly imported from GitHub repositories, causing significant developer confusion when searches for a package on pkg.go.dev can return several similarly named modules, although they may not necessarily be malicious in nature. “Attackers exploit the confusion, carefully crafting their malicious module namespaces to appear trustworthy at a glance, significantly increasing the likelihood developers inadvertently integrate destructive code into their projects,” Socket said. It’s assessed that the packages are the work of a single threat actor due to C2 reuse and the format of the code. The findings underscore the
continued
supply chain risks
arising from the cross-platform nature of Go to push malware.</p>

<p>The development coincides with the discovery of two npm packages,
naya-flore
and
nvlore-hsc
, that masquerade as WhatsApp socket libraries while incorporating a phone number-based kill switch that can remotely wipe developers’ systems. The packages, which have been collectively downloaded over 1,110 downloads, continue to remain available on the npm registry as of writing. Both libraries were published by a user named “
nayflore
“ in early July 2025. Central to their operations is their ability to retrieve a remote database of Indonesian phone numbers from a GitHub repository.</p>

<p>Once the package is executed, it first checks if the current phone is in the database, and, if not, proceeds to recursively delete all files using the command “rm -rf *” following a WhatsApp pairing process. The packages have also been found to contain a function to exfiltrate device information to an external endpoint, but calls to the function have been commented out, suggesting that the threat actor behind the scheme is signaling ongoing development. “naya-flore also contains a hardcoded GitHub Personal Access Token that provides unauthorized access to private repositories,” security researcher Kush Pandya
said
. “The purpose of this token remains unclear from the available code.”
“The presence of an unused GitHub token could indicate incomplete development, planned functionality that was never implemented, or usage in other parts of the codebase not included in these packages.”
Open-source repositories continue to be an attractive malware distribution channel in software supply chains, with the packages designed to steal sensitive information and even targeting cryptocurrency wallets in some cases.</p>

<p>“While overall tactics have not evolved significantly, attackers continue to rely on proven techniques, such as minimizing file count, using installation scripts, and employing discreet data exfiltration methods that maximize impact,” Fortinet FortiGuard Labs
said
. “A continued rise in obfuscation also further notes the importance of vigilance and ongoing monitoring required by users of these services. And as OSS continues to grow, so too will the attack surface for supply chain threats.”

<h2 id="the-ai-powered-security-shift-what-2025-is-teaching-us-about-cloud-defense"><a id="article-4"></a>The AI-Powered Security Shift: What 2025 Is Teaching Us About Cloud Defense</h2>

<p>Now that we are well into 2025, cloud attacks are evolving faster than ever and artificial intelligence (AI) is both a weapon and a shield. As AI rapidly changes how enterprises innovate, security teams are now tasked with a triple burden:
Secure AI
embedded in every part of the business. Use AI
to defend faster and smarter. Fight AI-powered threats
that execute in minutes—or seconds.</p>

<p>Security is no longer about balancing speed and safety. In today’s cloud-native world, real-time, context-aware defense is a baseline expectation, not a competitive edge. The recent
Sysdig Cloud Defense Report 2025
breaks down this tectonic shift. Below, we unpack its key insights for security practitioners aiming to stay ahead of an accelerating threat landscape.</p>

<p>AI: The Double-Edged Sword of Cloud Security
AI is transforming the security paradigm. It’s both empowering defenders while creating entirely new attack surfaces. AI for Security: Fighting Fire with Fire
Attackers are automating faster. In campaigns like
CRYSTALRAY
, adversaries chain together open-source tools to perform reconnaissance, lateral movement, and credential harvesting.</p>

<p>These attacks show a level of coordination and speed that would be impossible without automation. Security teams are responding in kind. Tools like
Sysdig Sage
™
, a fully integrated AI cloud security analyst, are driving mean time to respond down by 76%. More than half of Sysdig customers now use Sysdig Sage, with the software and business services sectors leading adoption.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Key ways security teams are leveraging AI include:</dt>
  <dt>Contextual enrichment</dt>
  <dd>AI quickly correlates related events and aggregates data that makes alerts understandable. Summarization and deduplication</dd>
  <dd>AI links alerts to previous incidents and helps focus on what’s relevant. Workflow automation</dd>
  <dd>AI handles repetitive tasks like ticket creation, vulnerability analysis, and escalation logic. Decision acceleration</dd>
  <dd>By acting as a tier-one analyst, AI allows human defenders to move faster and make informed decisions.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The lesson is simple: in a cloud world where attacks happen at machine speed, defense must be equally agile. Security for AI: Protecting the New Digital Crown Jewels
But here’s the flip side: AI itself is now a prime target that needs to be protected. The Sysdig Threat Research Team has been identifying and reporting more attacks against LLMs and other AI tools since mid-2024. Sysdig observed a 500% surge in cloud workloads containing AI/ML packages in 2024, indicating massive adoption.</p>

<p>However, a recent 25% decline suggests teams are buckling down on security and improving governance. Recommendations to secure AI systems include securing APIs by authenticating and restricting access to public endpoints, hardening configurations by disabling open defaults like unauthenticated admin panels, enforcing least privilege to control root access and limit elevated permissions, monitoring for shadow AI through workload audits for unauthorized models and packages, and implementing data guardrails to filter prompts and outputs for sensitive information. The bottom line: AI requires the same level of rigor and protection as any other business-critical system, especially as it becomes deeply embedded across both customer-facing and back-end operations. Runtime Security: No Longer Optional, But Foundational
Prevention may reign supreme, but in today’s cloud-native, ephemeral world, runtime visibility is your best shot at catching in motion that slips through the cracks.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>The Case for Real-Time Threat Detection</dt>
  <dt>Runtime detection isn’t just a defensive layer—it’s a strategic necessity in today’s cloud-native environments. With 60% of containers living for one minute or less and CI/CD pipelines emerging as high-value targets due to misconfigurations and insecure defaults, the window to detect and respond is incredibly narrow. Cloud attacks now unfold in 10 minutes or less, prompting the creation of the</dt>
  <dt>555 Cloud Detection and Response Benchmark</dt>
  <dd>a framework that guides security teams to detect threats in 5 seconds, investigate in 5 minutes, and respond within the next 5 minutes. Why Runtime Context Matters
Traditional vulnerability scans bury teams under noise.</dd>
  <dt>But less than 6% of high and critical vulnerabilities are active in production. That means the rest are distractions. Runtime insights help security teams:</dt>
  <dt>Prioritize real risks</dt>
  <dd>Focus remediation on vulnerabilities loaded into memory. Reduce noise</dd>
  <dd>Cut vulnerability lists by up to 99%.</dd>
  <dt>Collaborate better</dt>
  <dd>Provide developers with clear, contextual remediation steps. The CI/CD Pipeline: A Growing Target
CI/CD workflows sit at the heart of modern DevOps, enabling rapid, automated delivery. But in 2025, they’ve also emerged as an attractive and increasingly exploited attack surface. From repository compromises to misconfigured automation, attackers are finding creative ways to infiltrate build systems—often before code even reaches production.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Several high-impact vulnerabilities uncovered this year reveal just how exposed the CI/CD pipeline can be. These incidents serve as a wake-up call: your build system is part of your attack surface—and without real-time visibility, you might not spot an attack until it’s too late. Tools like Falco and Falco Actions are helping defenders stay one step ahead by detecting threats as they execute, not after the damage is done. Open Source: The Heart of Modern Security Innovation
Security has always been about community.</p>

<p>Attackers share tools, and defenders must too. Open source tools now power much of the modern cloud defense strategy. Falco has evolved from a basic intrusion detection system (IDS) into a powerful real-time detection engine, now supporting eBPF for deeper visibility into cloud-native environments, all with the support of the open source community. It integrates with tools like Falco Actions, Falcosidekick, and Falco Talon to provide broader control, automation, and workflow customization.</p>

<p>This makes Falco especially valuable in regulated sectors such as finance, health care, and government, where self-hosted deployments and custom detection rules are critical for compliance and control. The EU Data Act and the Rise of Sovereign Security
With regulations like the EU Data Act taking effect in September 2025, organizations are required to control and localize their data. Open source plays a critical role in meeting these requirements by enabling self-hosted deployments, offering transparent codebases for audit and compliance, and fostering community-driven innovation that supports trust and flexibility.

<h2 id="microsoft-discloses-exchange-server-flaw-enabling-silent-cloud-access-in-hybrid-setups"><a id="article-5"></a>Microsoft Discloses Exchange Server Flaw Enabling Silent Cloud Access in Hybrid Setups</h2>

<p>Microsoft has released an advisory for a high-severity security flaw affecting on-premise versions of Exchange Server that could allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges under certain conditions. The vulnerability, tracked as
CVE-2025-53786
, carries a CVSS score of 8.0. Dirk-jan Mollema with Outsider Security has been acknowledged for reporting the bug. “In an Exchange hybrid deployment, an attacker who first gains administrative access to an on-premises Exchange server could potentially escalate privileges within the organization’s connected cloud environment without leaving easily detectable and auditable traces,” the tech giant
said
in the alert.</p>

<p>“This risk arises because Exchange Server and Exchange Online share the same service principal in hybrid configurations.”
Successful exploitation of the flaw could allow an attacker to escalate privileges within the organization’s connected cloud environment without leaving easily detectable and auditable traces, the company added. However, the attack hinges on the threat actor already having administrator access to an Exchange Server. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), in a bulletin of its own,
said
the vulnerability could impact the identity integrity of an organization’s Exchange Online service if left unpatched.</p>

<p>As mitigations, customers are recommended to
review
Exchange Server security changes for hybrid deployments, install the
April 2025 Hot Fix
(or newer), and follow the
configuration instructions
. “If you’ve previously configured Exchange hybrid or
OAuth authentication between Exchange Server and your Exchange Online organization
but no longer use it, make sure to
reset the service principal’s keyCredentials
,” Microsoft said. In a
presentation
at the Black Hat USA 2025 security conference, Mollema said on-premise versions of Exchange Server have a certificate credential that’s used to authenticate to Exchange online and allow OAuth in hybrid scenarios. These certificates can be leveraged to request Service-to-Service (
S2S
) actor tokens from Microsoft’s Access Control Service (
ACS
), ultimately providing unfettered access to Exchange Online and SharePoint without any
Conditional Access
or security checks.</p>

<p>More importantly, these tokens can be used to impersonate any hybrid user within the tenant for a 24-hour period when the “
trustedfordelegation
“ property is set, and leave no logs when they are issued. As mitigations, Microsoft plans to enforce mandatory separation of Exchange on-premises and Exchange Online service principals by October 2025. The development comes as the Windows maker
said
it will begin temporarily blocking Exchange Web Services (EWS) traffic using the Exchange Online shared service principal starting this month in an effort to increase the customer adoption of the dedicated Exchange hybrid app and improve the security posture of the hybrid environment. Microsoft’s advisory for CVE-2025-53786 also coincides with CISA’s analysis of various malicious artifacts deployed following the exploitation of
recently disclosed SharePoint flaws
, collectively tracked as ToolShell.</p>

<p>This includes two Base64-encoded DLL binaries and four Active Server Page Extended (ASPX) files that are designed to retrieve machine key settings within an ASP.NET application’s configuration and act as a web shell to execute commands and upload files. “Cyber threat actors could leverage this malware to steal cryptographic keys and execute a Base64-encoded PowerShell command to fingerprint the host system and exfiltrate data,” the agency
said
. CISA is also urging entities to disconnect public-facing versions of Exchange Server or SharePoint Server that have reached their end-of-life (EOL) or end-of-service from the internet, not to mention discontinue the use of outdated versions. Found this article interesting?</p>

<h2 id="6500-axis-servers-expose-remoting-protocol-4000-in-us-vulnerable-to-exploits"><a id="article-6"></a>6,500 Axis Servers Expose Remoting Protocol; 4,000 in U.S. Vulnerable to Exploits</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed multiple security flaws in video surveillance products from Axis Communications that, if successfully exploited, could expose them to takeover attacks. “The attack results in pre-authentication remote code execution on Axis Device Manager, a server used to configure and manage fleets of cameras, and the Axis Camera Station, client software used to view camera feeds,” Claroty researcher Noam Moshe
said
. “Furthermore, using internet scans of exposed Axis.Remoting services, an attacker can enumerate vulnerable servers and clients, and carry out granular, highly targeted attacks.”
The list of identified flaws is below -
CVE-2025-30023
(CVSS score: 9.0) - A flaw in the communication protocol used between client and server that could lead to an authenticated user performing a remote code execution attack (Fixed in Camera Station Pro 6.9, Camera Station 5.58, and Device Manager 5.32)
CVE-2025-30024
(CVSS score: 6.8) - A flaw in the communication protocol used between client and server that could be leveraged to execute an adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attack (Fixed in Device Manager 5.32)
CVE-2025-30025
(CVSS score: 4.8) - A flaw in the communication protocol used between the server process and the service control that could lead to a local privilege escalation (Fixed in Camera Station Pro 6.8 and Device Manager 5.32)
CVE-2025-30026
(CVSS score: 5.3) - A flaw in the Axis Camera Station Server that could lead to an authentication bypass (Fixed in Camera Station Pro 6.9 and Camera Station 5.58)
Successful exploitation of the aforementioned vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to assume an AitM position between the Camera Station and its clients, effectively making it possible to alter requests/responses and execute arbitrary actions on either the server or client systems. There is
no evidence
that the issues have been exploited in the wild.</p>

<p>Claroty said it found more than 6,500 servers that expose the proprietary Axis.Remoting protocol and its services over the internet, out of which nearly 4,000 of them are located in the U.S. “Successful exploits give attackers system-level access on the internal network and the ability to control each of the cameras within a specific deployment,” Moshe noted. “Feeds can be hijacked, watched, and/or shut down. Attackers can exploit these security issues to bypass authentication to the cameras and gain pre-authentication remote code execution on the devices.”

<h2 id="sonicwall-confirms-patched-vulnerability-behind-recent-vpn-attacks-not-a-zero-day"><a id="article-7"></a>SonicWall Confirms Patched Vulnerability Behind Recent VPN Attacks, Not a Zero-Day</h2>

<p>SonicWall has revealed that the
recent spike in activity
targeting its Gen 7 and newer firewalls with SSL VPN enabled is related to an older, now-patched bug and password reuse. “We now have high confidence that the recent SSL VPN activity is not connected to a zero-day vulnerability,” the company
said
. “Instead, there is a significant correlation with threat activity related to CVE-2024-40766.”
CVE-2024-40766 (CVSS score: 9.3) was
first disclosed
by SonicWall in August 2024, calling it an improper access control issue that could allow malicious actors unauthorized access to the devices. “An improper access control vulnerability has been identified in the SonicWall SonicOS management access, potentially leading to unauthorized resource access and, in specific conditions, causing the firewall to crash,” it
noted
in an advisory at the time.</p>

<p>SonicWall also said it’s investigating less than 40 incidents related to this activity, and that many of the incidents are related to migrations from Gen 6 to Gen 7 firewalls without resetting the local user passwords, a crucial recommendation action as part of CVE-2024-40766. Furthermore, the company pointed out that SonicOS 7.3 has additional protection against brute-force password and multi-factor authentication (MFA) attacks. The updated guidance offered by the company is below -
Update firmware to SonicOS version 7.3.0
Reset all local user account passwords for any accounts with SSLVPN access, particularly those that were carried over during migration from Gen 6 to Gen 7
Enable Botnet Protection and Geo-IP Filtering

<h2 id="researchers-uncover-ecscape-flaw-in-amazon-ecs-enabling-cross-task-credential-theft"><a id="article-8"></a>Researchers Uncover ECScape Flaw in Amazon ECS Enabling Cross-Task Credential Theft</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have demonstrated an “end-to-end privilege escalation chain” in Amazon Elastic Container Service (
ECS
) that could be exploited by an attacker to conduct lateral movement, access sensitive data, and seize control of the cloud environment. The attack technique has been codenamed ECScape by
Sweet Security
researcher Naor Haziz, who
presented
the findings today at the Black Hat USA security conference that’s being held in Las Vegas. “We identified a way to abuse an undocumented ECS internal protocol to grab AWS credentials belonging to other ECS tasks on the same EC2 instance,” Haziz
said
in a report shared with The Hacker News. “A malicious container with a low‑privileged IAM [Identity and Access Management] role can obtain the permissions of a higher‑privileged container running on the same host.”
Amazon ECS is a fully-managed container orchestration service that allows users to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications, while integrating with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to run container workloads in the cloud.</p>

<p>The vulnerability identified by Sweet Security essentially allows for privilege escalation by allowing a low-privileged task running on an ECS instance to hijack the IAM privileges of a higher-privileged container on the same EC2 machine by stealing its credentials. In other words, a malicious app in an ECS cluster could assume the role of a more privileged task. This is facilitated by taking advantage of a
metadata service running at 169.254.170[.]2
that exposes the temporary credentials associated with the task’s IAM role. While this approach ensures that each task gets credentials for its IAM role and they are delivered at runtime, a leak of the ECS agent’s identity could permit an attacker to impersonate the agent and obtain credentials for any task on the host.</p>

<p>The entire sequence is as follows -
Obtain the host’s IAM role credentials (EC2 Instance Role) so as to impersonate the agent
Discover the ECS control plane endpoint that the agent talks to
Gather the necessary identifiers (cluster name/ARN, container instance ARN, Agent version information, Docker version, ACS protocol version, and Sequence number) to authenticate as the agent using the Task Metadata endpoint and ECS introspection API
Forge and sign the Agent Communication Service (ACS) WebSocket Request impersonating the agent with the sendCredentials parameter set to “true”
Harvest credentials for all running tasks on that instance
“The forged agent channel also remains stealthy,” Haziz said. “Our malicious session mimics the agent’s expected behavior – acknowledging messages, incrementing sequence numbers, sending heartbeats – so nothing seems amiss.”
“By impersonating the agent’s upstream connection, ECScape completely collapses that trust model: one compromised container can passively collect every other task’s IAM role credentials on the same EC2 instance and immediately act with those privileges.”
ECScape can have severe consequences when running ECS tasks on shared EC2 hosts, as it opens the door to cross-task privilege escalation, secrets exposure, and metadata exfiltration. Following responsible disclosure, Amazon has emphasized the need for customers to adopt stronger isolation models where applicable, and make it clear in its
documentation
that there is no task isolation in EC2 and that “containers can potentially access credentials for other tasks on the same container instance.”
As mitigations, it’s
advised
to avoid deploying high-privilege tasks alongside untrusted or low-privilege tasks on the same instance, use AWS Fargate for true isolation, disable or restrict the instance metadata service (IMDS) access for tasks, limit ECS agent permissions, and set up CloudTrail alerts to detect unusual usage of IAM roles. “The core lesson is that you should treat each container as potentially compromiseable and rigorously constrain its blast radius,” Haziz said.</p>

<p>“AWS’s convenient abstractions (task roles, metadata service, etc.) make life easier for developers, but when multiple tasks with different privilege levels share an underlying host, their security is only as strong as the mechanisms isolating them – mechanisms which can have subtle weaknesses.”
The development comes in the wake of several cloud-related security weaknesses that have been reported in recent weeks -
A
race condition
in Google Cloud Build’s GitHub integration that could have allowed an attacker to bypass maintainer review and build un-reviewed code after a “/gcbrun” command is issued by the maintainer
A
remote code execution vulnerability
in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Code Editor that an attacker could use to hijack a victim’s Cloud Shell environment and potentially pivot across OCI services by tricking a victim, already logged into Oracle Cloud, to visit a malicious HTML page hosted on a server by means of a drive-by attack
An attack technique called
I SPy
that exploits a Microsoft first-party application’s Service principal (SP) in Entra ID for persistence and privilege escalation via federated authentication
A
privilege escalation vulnerability
in the Azure Machine Learning service that allows an attacker with only Storage Account access to modify invoker scripts stored in the AML storage account and execute arbitrary code within an AML pipeline, enabling them to extract secrets from Azure Key Vaults, escalate privileges, and gain broader access to cloud resources
A
scope vulnerability
in the legacy
AmazonGuardDutyFullAccess
AWS managed policy that could allow a full organizational takeover from a compromised member account by registering an arbitrary delegated administrator
An
attack technique
that abuses
Azure Arc
for privilege escalation by leveraging the Azure Connected Machine Resource Administrator role and as a
persistence mechanism
by setting up as command-and-control (C2)
A case of
over-privileged Azure built-in Reader roles and a vulnerability in Azure API
that could be chained by an attacker to leak VPN keys and then use the key to gain access to both internal cloud assets and on-premises networks
A
supply chain compromise vulnerability
in Google Gerrit called GerriScary that enabled unauthorized code submissions to at least 18 Google projects, including ChromiumOS (
CVE-2025-1568
, CVSS score: 8.8), Chromium, Dart, and Bazel, by exploiting misconfigurations in the default “addPatchSet” permission, the voting system’s label handling, and a race condition with bot code-submission timings during the code merge process
A Google Cloud Platform
misconfiguration
that
exposed
the subnetworks used for member exchanges at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), thereby allowing attackers to potentially abuse Google’s cloud infrastructure to gain unauthorized access to internal IXP LANs. An extension of a Google Cloud
privilege escalation vulnerability
called
ConfusedFunction
that can be adapted to other cloud platforms like AWS and Azure using AWS Lambda and Azure Functions, respectively, in addition to extending it to perform environment enumeration
“The most effective mitigation strategy to protect your environment from similar threat actor behavior is to ensure that all SAs [Service Account] within your cloud environment adhere to the principle of least privilege and that no legacy cloud SAs are still in use,” Talos said. “Ensure that all cloud services and dependencies are up to date with the latest security patches. If legacy SAs are present, replace them with least-privilege SAs.”

<h2 id="fake-vpn-and-spam-blocker-apps-tied-to-vextrio-used-in-ad-fraud-subscription-scams"><a id="article-9"></a>Fake VPN and Spam Blocker Apps Tied to VexTrio Used in Ad Fraud, Subscription Scams</h2>

<p>The malicious ad tech purveyor known as
VexTrio Viper
has been observed developing several malicious apps that have been published on Apple and Google’s official app storefronts under the guise of seemingly useful applications. These apps masquerade as VPNs, device “monitoring” apps, RAM cleaners, dating services, and spam blockers, DNS threat intelligence firm Infoblox said in an exhaustive analysis shared with The Hacker News. “They released apps under several developer names, including HolaCode, LocoMind, Hugmi, Klover Group, and AlphaScale Media,” the company
said
. “Available in the Google Play and Apple store, these have been downloaded millions of times in aggregate.”
These fake apps, once installed, deceive users into signing up for subscriptions that are difficult to cancel, flood them with ads, and part with personal information like email addresses.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that LocoMind was
previously flagged
by Cyjax as part of a phishing campaign serving ads that falsely claim their devices have been damaged. One such Android app is
Spam Shield block
, which purports to be a spam blocker for push notifications but, in reality, charges users several times after convincing them to enroll in a subscription. “Right away it asks for money, and if you don’t, the ads are so disruptive that I uninstalled it before I was even able to try it,” one user said in a review of the app on the Google Play Store. Another review went: “This app is supposed to be $14.99 a month.</p>

<p>During the month of February I have been billed weekly for $14.99 that comes to $70 monthly/$720 a year. NOT WORTH IT. And having problems trying to uninstall it. They tell you one price and then they turn around and charge you something else.</p>

<p>They’re probably hoping that you won’t see it. Or it will be too late to get a refund. All I want is this junk off of my phone.”
How threat actors leverage compromised sites and smartlinks to earn money
The new findings lay bare the scale of the multinational criminal enterprise that’s VexTrio Viper, which includes operating traffic distribution services (TDSes) to redirect massive volumes of internet traffic to scams through their advertising networks since 2015, as well as managing payment processors such as Pay Salsa and email validation tools like DataSnap. “VexTrio and their partners are successful in part because their businesses are obfuscated,” the company said.</p>

<p>“But a larger part of their success is likely because they stick to fraud, where they know there is less risk of consequences.”
VexTrio is known for running what’s called a commercial affiliate network, serving as an intermediary between malware distributors who have, for example, compromised a collection of WordPress websites with malicious injects (aka publishing affiliates) and threat actors who advertise various fraudulent schemes ranging from sweepstakes to crypto scams (aka advertising affiliates). The TDS is assessed to be created by a shell company called AdsPro Group, with key figures behind the organization from Italy, Belarus, and Russia engaging in fraudulent activity since at least 2004, before expanding their operations to Bulgaria, Moldova, Romania, Estonia, and the Czechia around 2015. In all, over 100 companies and brands have been linked to VexTrio. “Russian organized crime groups began building an empire within ad tech starting in or around 2015,” Dr.</p>

<p>Renée Burton, VP of Infoblox Threat Intel, told The Hacker News. “VexTrio is a key group within this industry, but there are other groups. All types of cybercrime, from dating scams to investment fraud and information stealers use malicious adtech, and it goes largely unnoticed.”
But what makes the threat actor notable is that it controls both the publishing and advertising sides of affiliate networks through a vast network of intertwined companies like Teknology, Los Pollos, Taco Loco, and Adtrafico. In May 2024, Los Pollos said it had 200,000 affiliates and over 2 billion unique users every month.</p>

<p>The scams, more broadly, play out in this manner: Unsuspecting users who land on a legitimate-but-infected site are routed through a TDS under VexTrio’s control, which then leads the users to scam landing pages. This is achieved by means of a smartlink that cloaks the final landing page and hinders analysis. Los Pollos and Adtrafico are both cost-per-action (CPA) networks that allow publishing affiliates to earn a commission when a site visitor performs an intended action. This could be accepting a website notification, providing their personal details, downloading an app, or giving credit card information.</p>

<p>It has also been found to be a major spam distributor that reaches out to millions of potential victims, leveraging lookalike domains of popular mail services like SendGrid (“sendgrid[.]rest”) and MailGun (“mailgun[.]fun”) to facilitate the service. Another significant aspect is the use of cloaking services like IMKLO to disguise the real domains and evaluate criteria like the user’s location, their device type, their browser, and then determine the exact nature of content to be delivered. “The security industry, and much of the world, is more focused on malware right now,” Burton said. “This is in some sense victim blaming, in which there is a belief that people who fall for scams somehow deserve to be scammed more.”
“So, stealing your credit card information via malware – even when it requires some ridiculous stroke of keys, like the current fake captcha/
ClickFix attacks
– is somehow ‘worse’ than if you are conned into giving it up.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity education and greater awareness for treating scams with the same severity as malware are two ways to combat malicious adtech.”

<h2 id="ai-slashes-workloads-for-vcisos-by-68-as-smbs-demand-more--new-report-reveals"><a id="article-10"></a>AI Slashes Workloads for vCISOs by 68% as SMBs Demand More – New Report Reveals</h2>

<p>As the volume and sophistication of cyber threats and risks grow, cybersecurity has become mission-critical for businesses of all sizes. To address this shift, SMBs have been urgently turning to vCISO services to keep up with escalating threats and compliance demands. A recent report by Cynomi has found that a full 79% of MSPs and MSSPs see high demand for vCISO services among SMBs. How are service providers scaling to meet this demand?</p>

<p>Which business upside can they expect to see? And where does AI fit in? The answers can be found in
“The 2025 State of the vCISO Report”. This newly-released report offers a deep dive into the vCISO market evolution and the broader shift toward advanced cybersecurity services.</p>

<p>The bottom line? What used to be a niche offering is now a foundational service, and AI is transforming how it’s delivered. Below, we bring some of the main findings of the report. 319% Growth in vCISO Adoption: MSPs &amp; MSSPs Race to Meet SMB Demand
vCISO offerings provide a flexible, cost-effective way for organizations to access high-level cybersecurity expertise without the overhead of a full-time executive.</p>

<p>And with a growing number of attacks alongside the growing awareness of the importance of cybersecurity, it’s no surprise that demand for vCISO services is skyrocketing among SMBs. Demand for vCISO services is outpacing even compliance readiness and cyber insurance support. Figure 1: Demand for Advanced Cybersecurity Services Among SMB Clients
In response, adoption of the vCISO offering among MSPs and MSSPs has jumped from 21% in 2024 to 67% in 2025. This is a 319% increase in just one year.</p>

<p>In addition, 50% of the service providers who don’t yet, plan to launch vCISO offerings by year’s end. This adoption curve reflects a clear industry shift, from vCISO being a niche service to becoming a core one. Figure 2: Plans for Offering vCISO Services
Real Business Impact: Higher Margins, Better Upsell, More Recurring Revenue
The growth in adoption isn’t just driven by client demand. It’s also underpinned by strong business outcomes for providers.</p>

<p>Organizations that offer vCISO services report substantial gains:
41%
report an increase in upsell opportunities, leveraging vCISO for additional service offerings
40%
see improved operating margins
39%
report a measurable expansion in their customer base, including access to new prospects
And of course, vCISO services offer significant security benefits to clients. From the service provider angle, leading security expertise elevates them beyond mere temporary vendors to trusted, long-term strategic partners. Adoption Barriers Are Real, But They’re Operational, Not Strategic
While enthusiasm among service providers is high, not every provider has yet made the leap into vCISO services. Among those still in planning mode, the report identifies three primary concerns:
35% cite uncertainty around profitability or ROI.</p>

<p>33% highlight high upfront investment requirements. 32% point to a shortage of qualified cybersecurity professionals. Importantly, few providers doubt the market demand or business value of vCISO services. Instead, they’re struggling to implement them efficiently and profitably.</p>

<p>This is where technology and automation come into play. As AI-powered platforms reduce manual effort and enable scalable service delivery, the operational burden becomes far more manageable, opening the door for broader market participation. AI Is Reshaping the vCISO Delivery Model
AI is no longer a future consideration. It’s already having a profound impact on how vCISO services are delivered.</p>

<p>According to the report, 81% of MSPs and MSSPs are already using AI or automation within their vCISO workflows, and an additional 15% plan to adopt it within the next year. Figure 3: Use of Automation and AI Tools in vCISO Service Delivery
The applications of AI in vCISO services are wide-ranging and impactful: reporting automation and insights, remediation planning, compliance readiness and monitoring, risk and security assessments, task prioritization, and more. The result is a significant reduction in manual workload: an average decrease of 68%, with 42% of providers seeing 81–100% workload reductions in some areas. This allows service providers to support more clients, deliver higher-quality outputs, and improve profit margins, all without expanding headcount.</p>

<p>In effect, AI is enabling the kind of scale and consistency that traditional, human-led delivery models could not sustain. The Road Ahead: AI-Driven Scale, Strategy and Service Differentiation
The 2025 State of the vCISO Report paints a clear picture: As service providers continue to invest in automation and intelligent tooling, the vCISO model will shift from resource-heavy to AI-powered and highly efficient. Looking forward, we expect to see:
Wider market penetration among MSPs and MSSPs
Deeper integration of AI across vCISO services
Higher ROI, as service providers implement AI and other technologies in their processes and offerings. For a complete view of trends, benchmarks, and best practices shaping the future of virtual cybersecurity leadership, download the full

<h2 id="microsoft-launches-project-ire-to-autonomously-classify-malware-using-ai-tools"><a id="article-11"></a>Microsoft Launches Project Ire to Autonomously Classify Malware Using AI Tools</h2>

<p>Microsoft on Tuesday announced an autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agent that can analyze and classify software without assistance in an effort to advance malware detection efforts. The large language model (LLM)-powered autonomous malware classification system, currently a prototype, has been codenamed
Project Ire
by the tech giant. The system “automates what is considered the gold standard in malware classification: fully reverse engineering a software file without any clues about its origin or purpose,” Microsoft
said
. “It uses decompilers and other tools, reviews their output, and determines whether the software is malicious or benign.”
Project Ire, per the Windows maker, is an effort to enable malware classification at scale, accelerate threat response, and reduce the manual efforts that analysts have to undertake in order to examine samples and determine if they are malicious or benign.</p>

<p>Specifically, it uses specialized tools to reverse engineer software, conducting analysis at various levels, ranging from low-level binary analysis to control flow reconstruction and high-level interpretation of code behavior. “Its tool-use API enables the system to update its understanding of a file using a wide range of reverse engineering tools, including Microsoft memory analysis sandboxes based on Project Freta (opens in new tab), custom and open-source tools, documentation search, and multiple decompilers,” Microsoft said. Project Freta is a Microsoft Research initiative that
enables
“discovery sweeps for undetected malware,” such as rootkits and advanced malware, in memory snapshots of live Linux systems during memory audits. The evaluation is a multi-step process -
Automated reverse engineering tools identify the file type, its structure, and potential areas of interest
The system reconstructs the software’s control flow graph using frameworks like angr and Ghidra
The LLM invokes specialized tools through an API to identify and summarize key functions
The system calls a validator tool to verify its findings against evidence used to reach the verdict and classify the artifact
The summarization leaves a detailed “chain of evidence” log that details how the system arrived at its conclusion, allowing security teams to review and refine the process in case of a misclassification.</p>

<p>In tests conducted by the Project Ire team on a dataset of publicly accessible Windows drivers, the classifier has been found to correctly flag 90% of all files and incorrectly identify only 2% of benign files as threats. A second evaluation of nearly 4,000 “hard-target” files rightly classified nearly 9 out of 10 malicious files as malicious, with a false positive rate of only 4%. “Based on these early successes, the Project Ire prototype will be leveraged inside Microsoft’s Defender organization as Binary Analyzer for threat detection and software classification,” Microsoft said. “Our goal is to scale the system’s speed and accuracy so that it can correctly classify files from any source, even on first encounter.</p>

<p>Ultimately, our vision is to detect novel malware directly in memory, at scale.”
The development comes as Microsoft
said
it awarded a record $17 million in bounty awards to 344 security researchers from 59 countries through its vulnerability reporting program in 2024. A total of 1,469 eligible vulnerability reports were submitted between July 2024 and June 2025, with the highest individual bounty reaching $200,000. Last year, the company
paid
$16.6 million in bounty awards to 343 security researchers from 55 countries. Found this article interesting?</p>

<h2 id="trend-micro-confirms-active-exploitation-of-critical-apex-one-flaws-in-on-premise-systems"><a id="article-12"></a>Trend Micro Confirms Active Exploitation of Critical Apex One Flaws in On-Premise Systems</h2>

<p>Trend Micro has released mitigations to address critical security flaws in on-premise versions of Apex One Management Console that it said have been exploited in the wild. The vulnerabilities (
CVE-2025-54948
and
CVE-2025-54987
), both rated 9.4 on the CVSS scoring system, have been described as management console command injection and remote code execution flaws. “A vulnerability in Trend Micro Apex One (on-premise) management console could allow a pre-authenticated remote attacker to upload malicious code and execute commands on affected installations,” the cybersecurity company
said
in a Tuesday advisory. While both shortcomings are essentially the same, CVE-2025-54987 targets a different CPU architecture.</p>

<p>The Trend Micro Incident Response (IR) Team and Jacky Hsieh at CoreCloud Tech have been credited with reporting the two flaws. According to
ZeroPath
, CVE-2025-54948 stems from a lack of sufficient input validation in the management console’s backend, thereby allowing a remote attacker with access to the management console interface to craft payloads that inject malicious operating system commands and result in remote code execution. There are currently no details on how the issues are being exploited in real-world attacks. Trend Micro said it “observed at least one instance of an attempt to actively exploit one of these vulnerabilities in the wild.”
Mitigations for Trend Micro Apex One as a Service and Trend Vision One Endpoint Security - Standard Endpoint Protection have already been deployed as of July 31, 2025.</p>

<p>A short-term solution for on-premise versions is available in the form of a fix tool. A formal patch for the vulnerabilities is expected to be released in mid-August 2025. However, Trend Micro pointed out that while the tool fully protects against known exploits, it will disable the ability for administrators to utilize the Remote Install Agent function to deploy agents from the Trend Micro Apex One Management Console. It emphasized that other agent install methods, such as UNC path or agent package, are unaffected.</p>

<p>“Exploiting these type of vulnerabilities generally require that an attacker has access (physical or remote) to a vulnerable machine,” the company said. “In addition to timely application of patches and updated solutions, customers are also advised to review remote access to critical systems and ensure policies and perimeter security is up-to-date.”
Another prerequisite for successful exploitation is that the attacker must have access to the Trend Micro Apex One Management Console. Therefore, customers that have their console’s IP address exposed externally are recommended to implement source restrictions if not already applied. Found this article interesting?</p>
