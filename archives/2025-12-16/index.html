<h2 id="featured-chrome-browser-extension-caught-intercepting-millions-of-users-ai-chats"><a id="article-1"></a>Featured Chrome Browser Extension Caught Intercepting Millions of Users’ AI Chats</h2>

<p>A Google Chrome extension with a “Featured” badge and six million users has been
observed
silently gathering every prompt entered by users into artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbots like OpenAI ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude, Microsoft Copilot, DeepSeek, Google Gemini, xAI Grok, Meta AI, and Perplexity. The extension in question is
Urban VPN Proxy
, which has a 4.7 rating on the Google Chrome Web Store. It’s advertised as the “best secured Free VPN access to any website, and unblock content.” Its developer is a Delaware-based company named
Urban Cyber Security Inc
. On the Microsoft Edge Add-ons marketplace, it has
1.3 million installations
.</p>

<p>Despite claiming that it allows users to “protect your online identity, stay protected, and hide your IP,” the extension was updated on July 9, 2025, when version 5.5.0 was released with the AI data harvesting enabled by default using hard-coded settings. Specifically, this is achieved by means of a tailored executor JavaScript that’s triggered for each of the AI chatbots (i.e., chatgpt.js, claude.js, gemini.js) to intercept and gather the conversations every time a user who has installed the extension visits any of the targeted platforms. Once the script is injected, it overrides the browser APIs used to handle network requests – fetch() and XMLHttpRequest() – to make sure that every request is first routed through the extension’s code so as to capture the conversation data, including users’ prompts and the chatbot’s responses, and exfiltrate them to two remote servers (“analytics.urban-vpn[.]com” and “stats.urban-vpn[.]com”). The exact list of data captured by the extension is as follows -
Prompts entered by the user
Chatbot responses
Conversation identifiers and timestamps
Session metadata
AI platform and model used
“Chrome and Edge extensions auto-update by default,” Koi Security’s Idan Dardikman said in a report published today.</p>

<p>“Users who installed Urban VPN for its stated purpose – VPN functionality – woke up one day with new code silently harvesting their AI conversations.”
It’s worth mentioning that Urban VPN’s updated privacy policy, as of June 25, 2025, mentions that it collects this data to enhance Safe Browsing and for marketing analytics purposes, and that any other secondary use of the gathered AI prompts will be carried out on de-identified and anonymized data -
As part of the Browsing Data, we will collect the prompts and outputs quired [sic] by the End-User or generated by the AI chat provider, as applicable. Meaning, we are only interested in the AI prompt and the results of your interaction with the chat AI. Due to the nature of the data involved in AI prompts, some sensitive personal information may be processed. However, the purpose of this processing is not to collect personal or identifiable data, we cannot fully guarantee the removal of all sensitive or personal information, we implement measures to filter out or eliminate any identifiers or personal data you may submit through the prompts and to de-identify and aggregate the data.</p>

<p>One of the third-parties it shares “Web Browsing Data” with is an affiliated ad intelligence and brand monitoring firm named
BIScience
. The company uses the raw (not anonymized) data to create insights that are “commercially used and shared with Business Partners,” the VPN software maker notes. It’s worth noting BiScience, which also happens to own Urban Cyber Security Inc., was
called out
by an anonymous researcher earlier this January for collecting users’ browsing history, or clickstream data, as it’s called, under misleading privacy policy disclosures. The company is alleged to provide a software development kit (SDK) to partner third-party extension developers to collect clickstream data from users, which is
transmitted
to the
sclpfybn[.]com
and other endpoints under its control.</p>

<p>“BIScience and partners take advantage of loopholes in the Chrome Web Store policies, mainly exceptions listed in the
Limited Use policy
, which are the ‘approved use cases,’” the researcher noted, adding they “develop user-facing features that allegedly require access to browsing history, to claim the ‘necessary to providing or improving your single purpose’ exception.”
On the extension listing page, Urban VPN also highlights an “AI protection” feature, which it says checks prompts for personal data, chatbot responses for suspicious or unsafe links, and displays a warning before users submit their prompts or click on them. While this monitoring is framed as preventing users from accidentally sharing any personal information, what the developers fail to mention is that the data collection happens regardless of whether the feature is enabled. “The protection feature shows occasional warnings about sharing sensitive data with AI companies,” Dardikman said. “The harvesting feature sends that exact sensitive data - and everything else - to Urban VPN’s own servers, where it’s sold to advertisers.</p>

<p>The extension warns you about sharing your email with ChatGPT while simultaneously exfiltrating your entire conversation to a data broker.”
Koi Security said it observed identical AI harvesting functionality in three other unique extensions from the same publisher across Chrome and Microsoft Edge, taking its total install base to over eight million -
1ClickVPN Proxy
Urban Browser Guard
Urban Ad Blocker
All these extensions, with the exception of Urban Ad Blocker for Edge, carry the “Featured” badge, giving users an
impression
that they follow the platform’s “best practices and meet a high standard of user experience and design.”
“These badges signal to users that the extensions have been reviewed and meet platform quality standards,” Dardikman pointed out. “For many users, a Featured badge is the difference between installing an extension and passing it by - it’s an implicit endorsement from Google and Microsoft.”
The findings once again demonstrate how trust associated with extension marketplaces can be abused to amass sensitive data at scale, especially at a time when
users
are
increasingly
sharing
deeply personal information
, getting advice, and discussing emotions with
AI chatbots

<h2 id="freepbx-patches-critical-sqli-file-upload-and-authtype-bypass-flaws-enabling-rce"><a id="article-2"></a>FreePBX Patches Critical SQLi, File-Upload, and AUTHTYPE Bypass Flaws Enabling RCE</h2>

<p>Multiple security vulnerabilities have been
disclosed
in the open-source private branch exchange (PBX) platform FreePBX, including a critical flaw that could result in an authentication bypass under certain configurations. The shortcomings, discovered by Horizon3.ai and reported to the project maintainers on September 15, 2025, are listed below -
CVE-2025-61675
(CVSS score: 8.6) - Numerous authenticated SQL injection vulnerabilities impacting four unique endpoints (basestation, model, firmware, and custom extension) and 11 affected parameters that enable read and write access to the underlying SQL database
CVE-2025-61678
(CVSS score: 8.6) - An authenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability that allows an attacker to exploit the firmware upload endpoint to upload a PHP web shell after obtaining a valid PHPSESSID and run arbitrary commands to leak the contents of sensitive files (e.g., “/etc/passwd”)
CVE-2025-66039
(CVSS score: 9.3) - An authentication bypass vulnerability that occurs when the “Authorization Type” (aka AUTHTYPE) is set to “webserver,” allowing an attacker to log in to the Administrator Control Panel via a forged Authorization header
It’s worth mentioning here that the authentication bypass is not vulnerable in the default configuration of FreePBX, given that the “Authorization Type” option is only displayed when the three following values in the Advanced Settings Details are set to “Yes”:
Display Friendly Name
Display Readonly Settings, and
Override Readonly Settings
However, once the prerequisite is met, an attacker could send crafted HTTP requests to sidestep authentication and insert a malicious user into the “ampusers” database table, effectively accomplishing something similar to
CVE-2025-57819
, another flaw in FreePBX that was disclosed as having been actively exploited in the wild in September 2025. “These vulnerabilities are easily exploitable and enable authenticated/unauthenticated remote attackers to achieve remote code execution on vulnerable FreePBX instances,” Horizon3.ai security researcher Noah King said in a report published last week. The issues have been addressed in the following versions -
CVE-2025-61675
and
CVE-2025-61678</p>
<ul>
  <li>16.0.92 and 17.0.6 (Fixed on October 14, 2025)
CVE-2025-66039</li>
  <li>16.0.44 and 17.0.23 (Fixed on December 9, 2025)
In addition, the option to choose an authentication provider has now been removed from Advanced Settings and requires users to set it manually through the command-line using fwconsole.</li>
</ul>

<p>As temporary mitigations, FreePBX has recommended that users set “Authorization Type” to “usermanager,” set “Override Readonly Settings” to “No,” apply the new configuration, and reboot the system to disconnect any rogue sessions. “If you did find that web server AUTHTYPE was enabled inadvertently, then you should fully analyze your system for signs of any potential compromise,” it said. Users are also displayed a warning on the dashboard, stating “webserver” may offer reduced security compared to “usermanager.” For optimal protection, it’s advised to avoid using this authentication type. “It’s important to note that the underlying vulnerable code is still present and relies on authentication layers in front to provide security and access to the FreePBX instance,” King said.</p>

<p>“It still requires passing an Authorization header with a basic Base64-encoded username:password.”
“Depending on the endpoint, we noticed a valid username was required. In other cases, such as the file upload shared above, a valid username is not required, and you can achieve remote code execution with a few steps, as outlined. It is best practice not to use the authentication type webserver as it appears to be legacy code.”

<p>If you use a smartphone, browse the web, or unzip files on your computer, you are in the crosshairs this week. Hackers are currently exploiting critical flaws in the daily software we all rely on—and in some cases, they started attacking before a fix was even ready. Below, we list the urgent updates you need to install right now to stop these active threats. ⚡ Threat of the Week
Apple and Google Release Fixes for Actively Exploited Flaws
— Apple released security updates for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, visionOS, and Safari web browser to address two zero-days that the company said have been exploited in highly targeted attacks.</p>

<p>CVE-2025-14174 has been described as a memory corruption issue, while the second, CVE-2025-43529, is a use-after-free bug. They can both be exploited using maliciously crafted web content to execute arbitrary code. CVE-2025-14174 was also
addressed
by Google in its Chrome browser since it resides in its open-source Almost Native Graphics Layer Engine (ANGLE) library. There are currently no details on how these flaws were exploited, but evidence points to it likely having been weaponized by commercial spyware vendors.</p>

SOAPwn Exploits HTTP Client Proxies in .NET for RCE
— Cybersecurity researchers uncovered an unexpected behavior of HTTP client proxies in .NET applications, potentially allowing attackers to achieve remote code execution. The vulnerability has been codenamed SOAPwn.</p>

<p>At its core, the problem has to do with how .NET applications might be vulnerable to arbitrary file writes because .NET’s HTTP client proxies also accept non-HTTP URLs such as files, a behavior that Microsoft says developers are responsible for guarding against — but not likely to expect. This, in turn, can open remote code execution (RCE) attack paths through web shells and malicious PowerShell scripts in many .NET applications, including commercial products. By being able to pass an arbitrary URL to a SOAP API endpoint in an affected .NET application, an attacker can trigger a leak of NTLM challenge. The issue can also be exploited through Web Services Description Language (WSDL) imports, which can then be used to generate client SOAP proxies that can be controlled by the attacker.</p>

<p>“The .NET Framework allows its HTTP client proxies to be tricked into interacting with the filesystem. With the right conditions, they will happily write SOAP requests into local paths instead of sending them over HTTP,” watchTowr said. “In the best case, this results in NTLM relaying or challenge capture. In the worst case, it becomes remote code execution through webshell uploads or PowerShell script drops.”
Attackers Exploit New Flaw in CentreStack and Triofox
— A new vulnerability in Gladinet’s CentreStack and Triofox products is being actively exploited by unknown threat actors to achieve code execution.</p>

<p>The vulnerability, which does not have a CVE identifier, can be abused to access the web.config file, which can then be used to execute arbitrary code. At the core of the issue is a design failure in how they generate the cryptographic keys used to encrypt the access tokens the products use to control who can retrieve what files. As a result, the cryptographic keys never change and can be used to access files containing valuable data. Huntress said, as of December 10, 2025, nine organizations have been affected by the newly disclosed flaw.</p>

<p>WinRAR Flaw Exploited by Multiple Threat Actors
— A high-severity flaw in WinRAR (CVE-2025-6218, CVSS score: 7.8) has come under active exploitation, fueled by three different threat actors tracked as GOFFEE (aka Paper Werewolf), Bitter (aka APT-C-08 or Manlinghua), and Gamaredon. CVE-2025-6218 is a path traversal vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute code in the context of the current user. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added the vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, requiring Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to apply the necessary fixes by December 30, 2025.</p>

<p>Exploitation of React2Shell Surges
— The recently disclosed maximum-severity security flaw in React (CVE-2025-55182, CVSS score: 10.0) has come under widespread exploitation, with threat actors targeting unpatched systems to deliver various kinds of malware. Public disclosure of the flaw triggered a “rapid wave of opportunistic exploitation,” according to Wiz. Google said it observed a China-nexus espionage cluster UNC6600 exploiting React2Shell to deliver MINOCAT, a tunneling utility based on Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP). Other exploitation efforts included the deployment of the
SNOWLIGHT
downloader by UNC6586 (China-nexus), the COMPOOD backdoor (linked to suspected China-nexus espionage activity since 2022) by UNC6588, an updated version of the Go-based HISONIC backdoor by UNC6603 (China-nexus), and ANGRYREBEL.LINUX (aka
Noodle RAT
) by UNC6595 (China-nexus).</p>

<p>“These observed campaigns highlight the risk posed to organizations using unpatched versions of React and Next.js,” Google
said
. Hamas-Affiliated Group Goes After the Middle East
— WIRTE (aka Ashen Lepus), a cyber threat group associated with Hamas, has been conducting espionage on government bodies and diplomatic entities across the Middle East since 2018. In recent years, the threat actor has broadened its targeting scope to include Oman and Morocco, while simultaneously evolving its capabilities. The modus operandi follows tried-and-tested cyber espionage tactics, using spear-phishing emails to deliver malicious attachments that deliver a modular malware suite dubbed AshTag.</p>

<p>The components of the framework are embedded in a command-and-control (C2) web page within HTML tags in Base64-encoded format, from where they are parsed and decrypted to download the actual payloads. “Ashen Lepus remained persistently active throughout the Israel-Hamas conflict, distinguishing it from other affiliated groups whose activities decreased over the same period,” Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 said. “Ashen Lepus continued with its campaign even after the October 2025 Gaza ceasefire, deploying newly developed malware variants and engaging in hands-on activity within victim environments.” It’s being assessed that the group may be operating from outside Gaza, citing continued activity throughout the conflict. ‎️‍🔥 Trending CVEs

(Apache Struts 2). 📰 Around the Cyber World
U.K. Fines LastPass for 2022 Breach
— The U.K. Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) fined LastPass’s British subsidiary £1.2 million ($1.6 million) for a data breach in 2022 that
enabled
attackers to access personal information belonging to its customers, including their encrypted password vaults.</p>

<p>The hackers compromised a company-issued MacBook Pro of a software developer based in Europe to access the corporate development environment and related technical documentation, and exfiltrate a little over a dozen repositories. It’s unclear how the MacBook was infected. Subsequently, the threat actors gained access to one of the DevOps engineers’ PCs by
exploiting
CVE-2020-5741, a vulnerability in Plex Media Server, installed a keylogger used to steal the engineer’s master password, and breached the cloud storage environment. The ICO said LastPass failed to implement sufficiently robust technical and security measures.</p>

<p>“LastPass customers had a right to expect the personal information they entrusted to the company would be kept safe and secure,” John Edwards, U.K. Information Commissioner,
said
. “However, the company fell short of this expectation, resulting in the proportionate fine being announced today.”
APT-C-60 Targets Japan with SpyGlace
— The threat actor known as
APT-C-60
has been linked to continued cyber attacks targeting Japan to deliver
SpyGlace
using spear-phishing emails impersonating job seekers. The attacks were observed between June and August 2025, per JPCERT/CC.</p>

<p>“In the previous attacks, victims were directed to download a VHDX file from Google Drive,” the agency
said
. “However, in the latest attacks, the malicious VHDX file was directly attached to the email. When the recipient clicks the LNK file contained within the VHDX, a malicious script is executed via Git, which is a legitimate file.” The attacks leverage GitHub to download the main malware components, marking a shift from Bitbucket. ConsentFix, a New Twist on ClickFix
— Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new variation of the ClickFix attack.</p>

<p>Called
ConsentFix
, the new technique relies on tricking users into copy-pasting text that contains their OAuth material into an attacker-controlled web page. Push Security said it spotted the technique in attacks targeting Microsoft business accounts. In these attacks, targets are funneled through Google Search to compromised but reputable websites injected with a fake Cloudflare Turnstile challenge that instructs them to sign in to their accounts and paste the URL. Once the targets log in, they are redirected to a localhost URL containing the OAuth authorization code for their Microsoft account.</p>

<p>The phishing process ends when the victims paste the URL back into the original page, granting the threat actors unauthorized access. The attack “sees the victim tricked into logging into Azure CLI, by generating an OAuth authorization code — visible in a localhost URL — and then pasting that URL, including the code, into the phishing page,” the security company said. “The attack happens entirely inside the browser context, removing one of the key detection opportunities for ClickFix attacks because it doesn’t touch the endpoint.” The technique is a
variation of an attack
used by Russian state-sponsored hackers earlier this year that deceived victims into sending their OAuth authorization code via Signal or WhatsApp to the hackers. 2025 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses
— The U.S.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), along with the MITRE Corporation,
released
the 2025 Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses, identifying the
most critical vulnerabilities
that adversaries exploit to compromise systems, steal data, or disrupt services. It was compiled from 39,080 CVEs published this year. Topping the
list
is cross-site scripting, followed by SQL Injection, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), missing authorization, and out-of-bounds write. Salt Typhoon Spies Reportedly Attended Cisco Training Scheme
— Two of Salt Typhoon’s members, Yu Yang and Qiu Daibing, have been identified as participants of the 2012 Cisco Networking Academy Cup.</p>

<p>Both Yu and Qiu are co-owners of Beijing Huanyu Tianqiong, one of the Chinese companies that the U.S. government and its allies
allege
as being fronts for Salt Typhoon activity. Yu is also tied to another Salt Typhoon-connected company, Sichuan Zhixin Ruijie. SentinelOne found that Yu and Qiu represented Southwest Petroleum University in Cisco’s academy cup in China.</p>

<p>Yu’s team was placed second in the Sichuan region, while Qiu’s team took the first prize and later claimed the third spot nationally, despite the university being considered as a poorly-regarded academic institution. “The episode suggests that offensive capabilities against foreign IT products likely emerge when companies begin supplying local training and that there is a potential risk of such education initiatives inadvertently boosting foreign offensive research,” security researcher Dakota Cary
said
. The episode stresses the need for demonstrating technical competencies when hiring technical professionals and that offensive teams may benefit from putting their own employees through similar training initiatives like Huawei’s ICT academy. Freedom Chat Flaws Detailed
— A pair of security flaws has been disclosed in Freedom Chat that could have allowed a bad actor to guess registered users’ phone numbers (similar to the
recent WhatsApp flaw
) and expose user-set PINs to others on the app.</p>

<p>The issues,
discovered
by Eric Daigle, have since been addressed by the privacy-focused messaging app as of December 7, 2025. In an
update
pushed out to Apple and Google’s app stores, the company said: “A critical reset: A recent backend update inadvertently exposed user PINs in a system response. No messages were ever at risk, and because Freedom Chat does not support linked devices, your conversations were never accessible; however, we’ve reset all user PINs to ensure your account stays secure. Your privacy remains our top priority.”
Unofficial Patch for New Windows RasMan 0-Day Released
— Free unofficial patches have been made available for a new Windows zero-day vulnerability that allows unprivileged attackers to crash the Remote Access Connection Manager (RasMan) service.</p>

<p>ACROS Security’s 0patch service
said
it discovered a new denial-of-service (DoS) flaw while looking into
CVE-2025-59230
, a Windows RasMan privilege escalation vulnerability exploited in attacks that was patched in October. The new flaw has not been assigned a CVE identifier, and there is no evidence of it having been abused in the wild. It affects all Windows versions, including Windows 7 through Windows 11 and Windows Server 2008 R2 through Server 2025. Ukrainian National Charged for Cyber Attacks on Critical Infra
— U.S.</p>

<p>prosecutors have
charged
a Ukrainian national for her role in cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure worldwide, including U.S. water systems, election systems, and nuclear facilities, on behalf of Russian state-backed hacktivist groups. Victoria Eduardovna Dubranova (aka Vika, Tory, and SovaSonya), 33, was allegedly part of two pro-Kremlin hacktivist groups named
NoName057(16)

on other members of the two groups. Prosecutors said administrators of the two collectives, dissatisfied with the level of support and funding from the GRU, went on to form Z-Pentest in September 2024 to conduct hack-and-leak operations and defacement attacks.</p>

<p>“Pro-Russia hacktivist groups are conducting less sophisticated, lower-impact attacks against critical infrastructure entities, compared to advanced persistent threat (APT) groups. These attacks use minimally secured, internet-facing virtual network computing (VNC) connections to infiltrate (or gain access to) OT control devices within critical infrastructure systems,” U.S. and other allies
said
in a joint advisory. “Pro-Russia hacktivist groups – Cyber Army of Russia Reborn (CARR), Z-Pentest, NoName057(16), Sector 16, and affiliated groups – are capitalizing on the widespread prevalence of accessible VNC devices to execute attacks against critical infrastructure entities, resulting in varying degrees of impact, including physical damage.” These groups are known for their opportunistic attacks, typically leveraging unsophisticated tradecraft like known security flaws, reconnaissance tools, and common password-guessing techniques to access networks and conduct SCADA intrusions.</p>

<p>While their ability to consistently cause significant impact is limited, they also tend to work together to amplify each other’s posts to reach a broader audience on platforms like Telegram and X. X’s Safety team
said
it cooperated with U.S. authorities to suspend NoName057(16)’s account (“@NoName05716”) for facilitating criminal conduct. APT36 Targets Indian Government Entities with Linux Malware
— A new phishing campaign orchestrated by
APT36
(aka Transparent Tribe) has been observed delivering tailored malware specifically crafted to compromise Linux-based BOSS operating environments prevalent in Indian government networks.</p>

<p>“The intrusion begins with spear-phishing emails designed to lure recipients into opening weaponized Linux shortcut files,” CYFIRMA
said
. “Once executed, these files silently download and run malicious components in the background while presenting benign content to the user, thereby facilitating stealthy initial access and follow-on exploitation.” The attack culminates with the deployment of a Python-based Remote Administration Tool (RAT) that can collect system information, contact an external server, and run commands, granting the attackers remote control over infected hosts. “The group’s current activity reflects a broader trend in state-aligned espionage operations: the adoption of adaptive, context-aware delivery mechanisms designed to blend seamlessly into the target’s technology landscape,” the company said. Vietnamese IT and HR Firms Targeted by Operation Hanoi Thief
— A threat cluster referred to as
Operation Hanoi Thief
has targeted Vietnamese IT departments and HR recruiters using fake resumes distributed as ZIP files in phishing emails to deliver malware called LOTUSHARVEST.</p>

<p>The ZIP file contains a Windows shortcut (LNK) file that, when opened, executes a “pseudo-polyglot” payload present in the archive that serves as the lure and as well as the container for a batch script that displays a decoy PDF and uses DLL side-loading to load the LOTUSHARVEST DLL. The malware runs various anti-analysis checks and proceeds to harvest data from web browsers such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. The activity has been attributed with medium confidence to a threat cluster of Chinese origin. Microsoft Adds New PowerShell Security Feature
— With PowerShell 5.1, Microsoft has added a new feature to warn users when they’re about to execute web content.</p>

<p>The warning will alert users when executing the Invoke-WebRequest command without additional special parameters. “This prompt warns that scripts in the page could run during parsing and advises using the safer -UseBasicParsing parameter to avoid any script execution,” Microsoft
said
. “Users must choose to continue or cancel the operation. This change helps protect against malicious web content by requiring user consent before potentially risky actions.” The company also said it’s rolling out a new Baseline Security Mode in Office, SharePoint, Exchange, Teams, and Entra that can automatically configure apps with minimum security requirements.</p>

<p>The centralized experience began rolling out in phases last month and will be completed by March next year. “It provides admins with a dashboard to assess and improve security posture using impact reports and risk-based recommendations, with no immediate user impact,” Microsoft
said
. “Admins can view the tenant’s current security posture compared to Microsoft’s recommended minimum security bar.”
U.S. to Require Foreign Travelers to Share 5-Year Social Media History
— The U.S.</p>

<p>government will soon
require
all foreign travelers to provide five years’ worth of social media history prior to their entry. This includes details about social media accounts, email addresses, and phone numbers used over the past five years. The new requirement will be applied to foreigners from all countries, including those who are eligible to visit the U.S. for 90 days without a visa.</p>

<p>“We want to make sure we’re not letting the wrong people enter our country,” U.S. President Donald Trump said. New AitM Phishing Campaign Targets Microsoft 365 and Okta Users
— An active adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) phishing campaign is targeting organizations that use Microsoft 365 and Okta for their single sign-on (SSO), with the main goal of hijacking the legitimate SSO flow and bypassing multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods that are not phishing-resistant. “When a victim uses Okta as their identity provider (IdP), the phishing page hijacks the SSO authentication flow to bring the victim to a second-stage phishing page, which acts as a proxy to the organization’s legitimate Okta tenant and captures the victim’s credentials and session tokens,” Datadog
said
.</p>

<p>Phishing Campaign Uses Fake Calendly Invites to Spoof Major Brands
— A large-scale phishing campaign has Calendly-themed phishing lures entered around a fake job opportunity to steal Google Workspace and Facebook business account credentials. These emails purport to originate from brands like Louis Vuitton, Unilever, Lego, and Disney, among others. “Only after the victim has responded to an initial email was the phishing link delivered under the guise of a Calendly link to book time for a call,” Push Security
said
. “Clicking the link takes the victim to an authentic-looking page impersonating a Calendly landing page.</p>

<p>From there, users are prompted to complete a CAPTCHA check and continue to sign in with their Google account, which causes their credentials to be stolen using an AitM phishing page. A similar variant has also been observed tricking victims into entering their Facebook account credentials on bogus pages, while another targets both Google and Facebook credentials using Browser-in-the-Browser (
BitB
) techniques that display fake pop-up windows featuring legitimate URLs to steal account credentials. The fact that the campaign is focused on compromising accounts responsible for managing digital ads on behalf of businesses shows that the threat actors are looking to launch malvertising campaigns for other kinds of attacks, including ClickFix. This is not the first time job-related lures have been used to steal account information.</p>

<p>In October 2025, phishing emails impersonating Google Careers were
used
to phish credentials. In tandem, Push Security
said
it also observed a malvertising campaign in which users who searched for “Google Ads” on Google Search were served a malicious sponsored ad that’s designed to capture their credentials. Calendar Subscriptions for Phishing and Malware Delivery
— Threat actors have been found leveraging digital calendar subscription infrastructure to deliver malicious content. “The security risk arises from third-party calendar subscriptions hosted on expired or hijacked domains, which can be exploited for large-scale social engineering,” Bitsight
said
.</p>

<p>“Once a subscription is established, they can deliver calendar files that may contain harmful content, such as URLs or attachments, turning a helpful tool into an unexpected attack vector.” The attack takes advantage of the fact that these third-party servers can add events directly to users’ schedules. The cybersecurity company said it discovered more than 390 abandoned domains related to iCalendar synchronization (sync) requests for subscribed calendars, potentially putting about four million iOS and macOS devices at risk. All the identified domains have been sinkholed. The Gentlemen Ransomware Uses BYOVD Technique in Attacks
— A nascent ransomware group called
The Gentlemen

<h2 id="a-browser-extension-risk-guide-after-the-shadypanda-campaign"><a id="article-4"></a>A Browser Extension Risk Guide After the ShadyPanda Campaign</h2>

<p>In early December 2025, security researchers exposed a cybercrime
campaign
that had quietly hijacked popular Chrome and Edge browser extensions on a massive scale. A threat group dubbed ShadyPanda spent seven years playing the long game, publishing or acquiring harmless extensions, letting them run clean for years to build trust and gain millions of installs, then suddenly flipping them into malware via silent updates. In total, about 4.3 million users installed these once-legitimate add-ons, which suddenly went rogue with spyware and backdoor capabilities. This tactic was essentially a browser extension supply-chain attack.</p>

<p>The ShadyPanda operators even earned featured and verified badges in the official Chrome Web Store and Microsoft Edge Add-ons site for some extensions, reinforcing user confidence. Because extension updates happen automatically in the background, the attackers were able to push out malicious code without users noticing a thing. Once activated in mid-2024, the compromised extensions became a fully fledged remote code execution (RCE) framework inside the browser. They could download and run arbitrary JavaScript with full access to the browser’s data and capabilities.</p>

<p>This gave the attackers a range of spyware powers, from monitoring every URL and keystroke, to injecting malicious scripts into web pages, to exfiltrating browsing data and credentials. One of the worst capabilities was session cookie and token theft, stealing the authentication tokens that websites use to keep users logged in. The extensions could even impersonate entire SaaS accounts (like Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace) by hijacking those session tokens. Why Browser Extensions Are a SaaS Security Nightmare
For SaaS security teams, ShadyPanda’s campaign shows us a lot.</p>

<p>It proved that a malicious browser extension can effectively become an intruder with keys to your company’s SaaS kingdom. If an extension grabs a user’s session cookie or token, it can unlock that user’s accounts in Slack, Salesforce, or any other web service they’re logged into. In this case, millions of stolen session tokens could have led to unauthorized access to enterprise emails, files, chat messages, and more, all without triggering the usual security alarms. Traditional identity defenses like MFA were bypassed, because the browser session was already authenticated and the extension was piggybacking on it.</p>

<p>The risk extends beyond just the individual user. Many organizations allow employees to install browser extensions freely, without the scrutiny applied to other software. Browser extensions often slip through without oversight, yet they can access cookies, local storage, cloud auth sessions, active web content, and file downloads. This blurs the line between endpoint security and cloud security.</p>

<p>A malicious extension can be run on the user’s device (an endpoint issue), but it directly compromises cloud accounts and data (an identity/SaaS issue). ShadyPanda vividly shows the need to bridge endpoint and SaaS identity defense: security teams should think about treating the browser as an extension of the SaaS attack surface. Steps to Reduce Browser Extension Risk
So based on all of this, what can organizations do to reduce the risk of another ShadyPanda situation? Below is a practical guide with steps to tighten your defenses against malicious browser extensions.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Enforce Extension Allow Lists and Governance
Start by regaining control over which extensions can run in your environment. Conduct an audit of all extensions installed across the company’s browsers (both corporate-managed and BYOD if possible) and remove any that are unnecessary, unvetted, or high risk. It’s wise to require business justification for extensions that need broad permissions (for example, any addon that can read all website data).</li>
</ol>

<p>Use enterprise browser management tools to implement an allow list so that only approved extensions can be installed. This policy ensures new or unknown extensions are blocked by default, cutting off the long tail of random installs. Remember that popular extensions aren’t automatically safe, ShadyPanda’s malware hid in popular, trusted extensions that people had used for years. Treat all extensions as guilty until proven innocent by vetting them through your security team’s approval process.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Treat Extension Access Like OAuth Access
Shift your mindset to treat browser extensions similarly to third-party cloud apps in terms of the access they grant. In practice, this means integrating extension oversight into your identity and access management processes. Just as you might keep a catalog of authorized OAuth integrations, do the same for extensions.</li>
</ol>

<p>Map out what SaaS data or actions an extension could touch - for example, if an extension can read all web traffic, it effectively can read your SaaS application data in transit; if it can read cookies, it can impersonate the user on any service. Because malicious extensions can steal session tokens, your identity security tools should watch for signs of session hijacking: configure alerts for bizarre login patterns, like an OAuth token being used from two different locations, or an access attempt that bypasses MFA checks. The key point is to manage extensions with the same caution as any app that has been granted access to your data. Limit extension permissions where possible, and if an employee leaves the company or changes roles, ensure that high-risk extensions are removed just as you would revoke unneeded app access.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Audit Extension Permissions Regularly
Make extension review a recurring part of your security program, similar to quarterly access reviews or app assessments. Every few months, inventory the extensions and their permissions in use across your organization. Pay attention to what data or browser features each extension can access.</li>
</ol>

<p>For each extension, ask: Do we still need this? Has it requested any new permissions? Has its developer or ownership changed? Attackers often buy out benign extensions or slip in new maintainers before pushing bad updates.</p>

<p>By reviewing the extension publisher and update history, you can spot red flags. Also, watch for any extension that suddenly asks for broader permissions than before – that’s a clue it may have turned malicious. 4. Monitor for Suspicious Extension Behavior
Because browsers usually auto-update extensions silently, a trusted add-on can become malicious overnight with no obvious warning to the user.</p>

<p>Security teams should therefore implement monitoring to catch silent compromise. This can include technical measures and user-awareness cues. On the technical side, consider logging and analyzing extension activity: for example, monitor browser extension installations, update events, or unusual network calls from extensions (like frequent communication with unknown external domains). Some organizations inspect browser logs or use endpoint agents to flag if an extension’s files change unexpectedly.</p>

<p>If possible, you might restrict or stage extension updates - for instance, testing updates on a subset of machines before wide deployment. On the user side, educate employees to report if an extension that has been installed for a long time suddenly starts behaving differently (new UI changes, unexpected pop-ups, or performance issues could hint at a malicious update). The goal is to shorten the window between an extension going bad and your team detecting and removing it. Bridging Endpoint and SaaS Security (How Reco Can Help)
The ShadyPanda incident shows that attackers don’t always need zero-day exploits to infiltrate our systems; sometimes, they just need patience, user trust, and an overlooked browser extension.</p>

<p>For security teams, it’s a lesson that browser extensions are part of your attack surface. The browser is effectively an endpoint that sits between your users and your SaaS applications, so it’s important to bring extension management and monitoring into your overall security strategy. By enforcing allow lists, auditing permissions, monitoring updates, and treating extensions like the powerful third-party apps they are, you can drastically reduce the risk of an extension becoming your weakest link. Finally, consider how modern SaaS security platforms can support these efforts.</p>

<p>New solutions, such as dynamic SaaS security platforms, are emerging to help organizations get a handle on these kinds of risks. Reco’s Dynamic SaaS Security platform is designed to continuously map and monitor SaaS usage (including risky connected apps and extensions) and provide identity-driven threat detection. With the right platform, you can gain unified visibility into extensions across your environment and detect suspicious activity in real time. Reco can help bridge the gap between endpoint and cloud by correlating browser-side risks with SaaS account behavior, giving security teams a cohesive defense.</p>

<p>By taking these proactive steps and leveraging tools like Reco to automate and scale your SaaS security, you can stay one step ahead of the next ShadyPanda. Request a Demo: Get Started With Reco

<h2 id="phantom-stealer-spread-by-iso-phishing-emails-hitting-russian-finance-sector"><a id="article-5"></a>Phantom Stealer Spread by ISO Phishing Emails Hitting Russian Finance Sector</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of an active phishing campaign that’s targeting a wide range of sectors in Russia with phishing emails that deliver
Phantom Stealer
via malicious ISO optical disc images. The activity, codenamed Operation MoneyMount-ISO by Seqrite Labs, has primarily singled out finance and accounting entities, with those in the procurement, legal, payroll verticals emerging as secondary targets. “This campaign employs a fake payment confirmation lure to deliver the Phantom information-stealing malware through a multi-stage attachment chain,” the cybersecurity company
said
. The infection chain begins with a phishing email that masquerades as legitimate financial communications, urging recipients to confirm a recent bank transfer.</p>

<p>Attached to the email is a ZIP archive that claims to contain additional details, but, instead, contains an ISO file that, when launched, mounts on the system as a virtual CD drive. The ISO image (“Подтверждение банковского перевода.iso” or “Bank transfer confirmation.iso”) serves as an executable that’s designed to launch Phantom Stealer by means of an embedded DLL (“CreativeAI.dll”). Phantom Stealer is capable of extracting data from cryptocurrency wallet browser extensions installed in Chromium-based browsers and desktop wallet apps, as well as grab files, Discord authentication tokens, and browser-related passwords, cookies, and credit card details. It also monitors clipboard content, logs keystrokes, and runs a series of checks to detect virtualized, sandboxed, or analysis environments, and if so, aborts its execution.</p>

<p>Data exfiltration is achieved via a Telegram bot or to an attacker-controlled Discord webhook. On top of that, the stealer enables file transfer to an FTP server. In recent months, Russian organizations, mainly human resources and payroll departments, have also been targeted by phishing emails that employ lures related to bonuses or internal financial policies to deploy a previously undocumented implant named DUPERUNNER that loads
AdaptixC2
, an open-source command-and-control (C2) framework. Dubbed
DupeHike
, the campaign has been attributed to a threat cluster named UNG0902.</p>

<p>“The ZIP has been used as a preliminary source of spear-phishing-based infection containing decoys with PDF and LNK extension, which downloads the implant DUPERUNNER, which finally executes the Adaptix C2 Beacon,” Seqrite said. The LNK file (“Документ_1_О_размере_годовой_премии.pdf.lnk” or “Document_1_On_the_amount_of_the_annual_bonus.pdf.lnk”), in turn, proceeds to download DUPERUNNER from an external server using “powershell.exe.” The primary responsibility of the implant is to retrieve and display a decoy PDF and launch AdaptixC2 by injecting it into a legitimate Windows process like “explorer.exe,” “notepad.exe,” and “msedge.exe.”
Other phishing campaigns have taken aim at finance, legal, and aerospace sectors in Russia to distribute
Cobalt Strike
and malicious tools like Formbook, DarkWatchman, and PhantomRemote that are capable of data theft and hands-on keyboard control. The email servers of compromised Russian companies are used to send the spear-phishing messages. French cybersecurity company Intrinsec has attributed the intrusion set targeting the Russian aerospace industry to hacktivists aligned with Ukrainian interests.</p>

<p>The activity, detected between June and September 2025, shares overlaps with
Hive0117
,
Operation CargoTalon
, and
Rainbow Hyena
(aka Fairy Trickster, Head Mare, and PhantomCore). Some of these efforts have also been found to redirect users to phishing login pages hosted on the InterPlanetary File System (
IPFS
) and Vercel, designed to steal credentials associated with Microsoft Outlook and Bureau 1440, a Russian aerospace company. “The campaigns observed between June and September 2025 […] aimed at compromising entities actively cooperating with Russia’s army amidst the current conflict with Ukraine, largely assessed by the Western sanctions imposed on them,” Intrinsec
said

<h2 id="volklocker-ransomware-exposed-by-hard-coded-master-key-allowing-free-decryption"><a id="article-7"></a>VolkLocker Ransomware Exposed by Hard-Coded Master Key Allowing Free Decryption</h2>

<p>The pro-Russian hacktivist group known as
CyberVolk
(aka GLORIAMIST) has resurfaced with a new ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) offering called VolkLocker that suffers from implementation lapses in test artifacts, allowing users to decrypt files without paying an extortion fee. According to SentinelOne, VolkLocker (aka CyberVolk 2.x) emerged in August 2025 and is capable of targeting both Windows and Linux systems. It’s written in Golang. “Operators building new VolkLocker payloads must provide a bitcoin address, Telegram bot token ID, Telegram chat ID, encryption deadline, desired file extension, and self-destruct options,” security researcher Jim Walter
said
in a report published last week.</p>

<p>Once launched, the ransomware attempts to escalate privileges, performs reconnaissance and system enumeration, including checking local MAC address prefixes against known virtualization vendors like Oracle and VMware. In the next stage, it lists all available drives and determines the files to be encrypted based on the embedded configuration. VolkLocker uses AES-256 in Galois/Counter Mode (
GCM
) for encryption through Golang’s “crypto/rand” package. Every encrypted file is assigned a custom extension such as .locked or .cvolk.</p>

<p>However, an analysis of the test samples has uncovered a fatal flaw where the locker’s master keys are not only hard-coded in the binaries, but are also used to encrypt all files on a victim system. More importantly, the master key is also written to a plaintext file in the %TEMP% folder (“C:\Users\AppData\Local\Temp\system_backup.key”). Since this backup key file is never deleted, the design blunder enables self-recovery. That said, VolkLocker has all the hallmarks typically associated with a ransomware strain.</p>

<p>It makes Windows Registry modifications to thwart recovery and analysis, deletes volume shadow copies, and terminates processes associated with Microsoft Defender Antivirus and other common analysis tools. However, where it stands out is in the use of an enforcement timer, which wipes the content of user folders, viz. Documents, Desktop, Downloads, and Pictures, if victims fail to pay within 48 hours or enter the wrong decryption key three times. CyberVolk’s RaaS operations are managed through Telegram, costing prospective customers between $800 and $1,100 for either a Windows or Linux version, or between $1,600 and $2,200 for both operating systems.</p>

<p>VolkLocker payloads come with built-in Telegram automation for command-and-control, allowing users to message victims, initiate file decryption, list active victims, and get system information. As of November 2025, the threat actors have advertised a remote access trojan and keylogger, both priced at $500 each, indicating a broadening of their monetization strategy. CyberVolk launched its own RaaS in June 2024. Known for conducting distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and ransomware attacks on public and government entities to support Russian government interests, it’s
believed to be of Indian origin
.</p>

<p>“Despite repeated Telegram account bans and channel removals throughout 2025, CyberVolk has reestablished its operations and expanded its service offerings,” Walter said. “Defenders should see CyberVolk’s adoption of Telegram-based automation as a reflection of broader trends among politically-motivated threat actors. These groups continue to lower barriers for ransomware deployment while operating on platforms that provide convenient infrastructure for criminal services.”

<h2 id="cisa-adds-actively-exploited-sierra-wireless-router-flaw-enabling-rce-attacks"><a id="article-8"></a>CISA Adds Actively Exploited Sierra Wireless Router Flaw Enabling RCE Attacks</h2>

<p>The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Friday
added
a high-severity flaw impacting Sierra Wireless AirLink ALEOS routers to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (
KEV
) catalog, following reports of active exploitation in the wild. CVE-2018-4063
(CVSS score: 8.8/9.9) refers to an unrestricted file upload vulnerability that could be exploited to achieve remote code execution by means of a malicious HTTP request. “A specially crafted HTTP request can upload a file, resulting in executable code being uploaded, and routable, to the webserver,” the agency said.</p>

<p>“An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.”
Details of the six-year-old flaw were
publicly shared
by Cisco Talos in April 2019, describing it as an exploitable remote code execution vulnerability in the ACEManager “upload.cgi” function of Sierra Wireless AirLink ES450 firmware version 4.9.3. Talos reported the flaw to the Canadian company in December 2018. “This vulnerability exists in the file upload capability of templates within the AirLink 450,” the company said. “When uploading template files, you can specify the name of the file that you are uploading.”
“There are no restrictions in place that protect the files that are currently on the device, used for normal operation.</p>

<p>If a file is uploaded with the same name of the file that already exists in the directory, then we inherit the permissions of that file.”
Talos noted that some of the files that exist in the directory (e.g., “fw_upload_init.cgi” or “fw_status.cgi”) have executable permissions on the device, meaning an attacker can send HTTP requests to the “/cgi-bin/upload.cgi” endpoint to upload a file with the same name to achieve code execution. This is compounded by the fact that ACEManager runs as root, thereby causing any shell script or executable uploaded to the device to also run with elevated privileges. The addition of CVE-2018-4063 to the KEV catalog comes a day after a honeypot analysis conducted by Forescout over a 90-day period revealed that industrial routers are the most attacked devices in operational technology (OT) environments, with threat actors attempting to deliver botnet and
cryptocurrency miner
malware families like
RondoDox
,
Redtail
, and
ShadowV2
by exploiting the following flaws -
CVE-2024-12856
(Four-Faith routers)
CVE-2024-0012, CVE-2024-9474
, and
CVE-2025-0108
(Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS)
Attacks have also been recorded from a previously undocumented threat cluster named Chaya_005 that weaponized CVE-2018-4063 in early January 2024 to upload an unspecified malicious payload with the name “fw_upload_init.cgi.” No further successful exploitation efforts have been detected since then. “Chaya_005 appears to be a broader reconnaissance campaign testing multiple vendor vulnerabilities rather than focusing on a single one,” Forescout Research – Vedere Labs
said
, adding it’s likely the cluster is no longer a “significant threat.”
In light of active exploitation of CVE-2018-4063, Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies are advised to update their devices to a
supported version
or discontinue the use of the product by January 2, 2026, since it has reached end-of-support status.</p>

(CVSS score: 8.8) - A memory corruption issue in WebKit that may lead to memory corruption when processing maliciously crafted web content
Apple said it’s aware that the shortcomings “may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26.”
It’s worth noting that CVE-2025-14174 is the
same vulnerability
that Google issued patches for in its Chrome browser on December 10, 2025. It’s been described by the tech giant as an out-of-bounds memory access in the company’s open-source Almost Native Graphics Layer Engine (ANGLE) library, specifically in its
Metal renderer
. Apple Security Engineering and Architecture (SEAR) and Google Threat Analysis Group (TAG) have been credited with discovering and reporting the flaw, while Apple credited TAG with finding CVE-2025-43529.</p>

<p>This indicates that the vulnerabilities were likely weaponized in highly-targeted
mercenary spyware attacks
, given that they both affect WebKit, the rendering engine that’s also used in all third-party web browsers on iOS and iPadOS, including Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and others. The flaws have been addressed in the following versions and devices -
iOS 26.2 and iPadOS 26.2</p>
<ul>
  <li>iPhone 11 and later, iPad Pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation and later, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 8th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later
iOS 18.7.3 and iPadOS 18.7.3</li>
  <li>iPhone XS and later, iPad Pro 13-inch, iPad Pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation and later, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 7th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later
macOS Tahoe 26.2</li>
  <li>Macs running macOS Tahoe
tvOS 26.2</li>

  <li>Apple Watch Series 6 and later
visionOS 26.2</li>
  <li>Apple Vision Pro (all models)
Safari 26.2</li>
  <li>Macs running macOS Sonoma and macOS Sequoia

<h2 id="fake-osint-and-gpt-utility-github-repos-spread-pystorerat-malware-payloads"><a id="article-10"></a>Fake OSINT and GPT Utility GitHub Repos Spread PyStoreRAT Malware Payloads</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers are calling attention to a new campaign that’s leveraging GitHub-hosted Python repositories to distribute a previously undocumented JavaScript-based Remote Access Trojan (RAT) dubbed
PyStoreRAT
. “These repositories, often themed as development utilities or OSINT tools, contain only a few lines of code responsible for silently downloading a remote HTA file and executing it via ‘mshta.exe,’” Morphisec researcher Yonatan Edri
said
in a report shared with The Hacker News. PyStoreRAT has been described as a “modular, multi-stage” implant that can execute EXE, DLL, PowerShell, MSI, Python, JavaScript, and HTA modules. The malware also deploys an information stealer known as Rhadamanthys as a follow-on payload.</p>

<p>Attack chains involve distributing the malware through Python or JavaScript loader stubs embedded in GitHub repositories masquerading as OSINT tools, DeFi bots, GPT wrappers, and security-themed utilities that are designed to appeal to analysts and developers. The earliest signs of the campaign go back to mid-June 2025, with a steady stream of “repositories” published since then. The tools are promoted via social media platforms like YouTube and X, as well as artificially inflate the repositories’ star and fork metrics – a technique reminiscent of the
Stargazers Ghost Network
. The threat actors behind the campaign leverage either newly created GitHub accounts or those that lay dormant for months to publish the repositories, stealthily slipping the malicious payload in the form of “maintenance” commits in October and November after the tools began to gain popularity and landed on GitHub’s top trending lists.</p>

<p>In fact, many of the tools did not function as they were advertised, only displaying static menus or non-interactive interfaces in some cases, while others performed minimal placeholder operations. The intention behind the operation was to lend them a veneer of legitimacy by abusing GitHub’s inherent trust and deceiving users into executing the loader stub that’s responsible for initiating the infection chain. This effectively triggers the execution of a remote HTML Application (HTA) payload that, in turn, delivers the PyStoreRAT malware, which comes with capabilities to profile the system, check for administrator privileges, and scan the system for cryptocurrency wallet-related files, specifically those associated with Ledger Live, Trezor, Exodus, Atomic, Guarda, and BitBox02. The loader stub gathers a list of installed antivirus products and check strings matching “Falcon” (a reference to CrowdStrike Falcon) or “Reason” (a reference to Cybereason or ReasonLabs) likely in an attempt to reduce visibility.</p>

<p>In the event they are detected, it launches “mshta.exe” by means of “cmd.exe.” Otherwise, it proceeds with direct “mshta.exe” execution. Persistence is achieved by setting up a scheduled task that’s disguised as an NVIDIA app self-update. In the final stage, the malware contacts an external server to fetch commands to be executed on the host. Some of the supported commands are listed below -
Download and execute EXE payloads, including Rhadamanthys
Download and extract ZIP archives
Downloads a malicious DLL and executes it using “rundll32.exe”
Fetch raw JavaScript code and execute it dynamically in memory using eval()
Download and install MSI packages
Spawn a secondary “mshta.exe” process to load additional remote HTA payloads
Execute PowerShell commands directly in memory
Spread via removable drives by replacing legitimate documents with malicious Windows Shortcut (LNK) files
Delete the scheduled task to remove the forensic trail
It’s currently not known who is behind the operation, but the presence of Russian-language artifacts and coding patterns alludes to a threat actor of likely Eastern European origin, Morphisec said.</p>

<p>“PyStoreRAT represents a shift toward modular, script-based implants that can adapt to security controls and deliver multiple payload formats,” Edri concluded. “Its use of HTA/JS for execution, Python loaders for delivery, and Falcon-aware evasion logic creates a stealthy first-stage foothold that traditional EDR solutions detect only late in the infection chain.”
The disclosure comes as Chinese security vendor QiAnXin detailed another new remote access trojan (RAT) codenamed SetcodeRat that’s likely being propagated across the country since October 2025 via malvertising lures. Hundreds of computers, including those belonging to governments and enterprises, are said to have been infected in a span of one month. “The malicious installation package will first verify the region of the victim,” the QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center
said
.</p>

<p>“If it is not in the Chinese-speaking area, it will automatically exit.”
The malware is disguised as legitimate installers for popular programs like Google Chrome and proceeds to the next stage only if the system language corresponds to Mainland China (Zh-CN), Hong Kong (Zh-HK), Macao (Zh-MO), and Taiwan (Zh-TW). It also terminates the execution if a connection to a Bilibili URL (“api.bilibili[.]com/x/report/click/now”) is unsuccessful. In the next stage, an executable named “pnm2png.exe” is launched to sideload “zlib1.dll,” which then decrypts the contents of a file called “qt.conf” and runs it. The decrypted payload is a DLL that embeds the RAT payload.</p>

<p>SetcodeRat can either connect to Telegram or a conventional command-and-control (C2) server to retrieve instructions and carry out data theft. It enables the malware to take screenshots, log keystrokes, read folders, set folders, start processes, run “cmd.exe,” set socket connections, collect system and network connection information, update itself to a new version.

<h2 id="new-advanced-phishing-kits-use-ai-and-mfa-bypass-tactics-to-steal-credentials-at-scale"><a id="article-11"></a>New Advanced Phishing Kits Use AI and MFA Bypass Tactics to Steal Credentials at Scale</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have documented four new phishing kits named
BlackForce, GhostFrame, InboxPrime AI, and Spiderman
that are capable of facilitating credential theft at scale. BlackForce, first detected in August 2025, is designed to steal credentials and perform Man-in-the-Browser (
MitB
) attacks to capture one-time passwords (OTPs) and bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA). The kit is sold on Telegram forums for anywhere between €200 ($234) and €300 ($351). The kit, according to
Zscaler ThreatLabz
researchers Gladis Brinda R and Ashwathi Sasi, has been used to impersonate over 11 brands, including Disney, Netflix, DHL, and UPS.</p>

<p>It’s said to be in active development. “BlackForce features several evasion techniques with a blocklist that filters out security vendors, web crawlers, and scanners,” the company said. “BlackForce remains under active development. Version 3 was widely used until early August, with versions 4 and 5 being released in subsequent months.”
Phishing pages connected to the kit have been found to use JavaScript files with what has been described as “
cache busting
“ hashes in their names (e.g., “index-[hash].js”), thereby forcing the victim’s web browser to download the latest version of the malicious script instead of using a cached version.</p>

<p>In a typical attack using the kit, victims who click on a link are redirected to a malicious phishing page, after which a server-side check filters out crawlers and bots, before serving them a page that’s designed to mimic a legitimate website. Once the credentials are entered on the page, the details are captured and sent to a Telegram bot and a command-and-control (C2) panel in real-time using an HTTP client called
Axios
. When the attacker attempts to log in with the stolen credentials on the legitimate website, an MFA prompt is triggered. At this stage, the MitB techniques are used to display a fake MFA authentication page to the victim’s browser through the C2 panel.</p>

<p>Should the victim enter the MFA code on the bogus page, it’s collected and used by the threat actor to gain unauthorized access to their account. “Once the attack is complete, the victim is redirected to the homepage of the legitimate website, hiding evidence of the compromise and ensuring the victim remains unaware of the attack,” Zscaler said. GhostFrame Fuels 1M+ Stealth Phishing Attacks
Another nascent phishing kit that has gained traction since its discovery in September 2025 is GhostFrame. At the heart of the kit’s architecture is a simple HTML file that appears harmless while hiding its malicious behavior within an embedded iframe, which leads victims to a phishing login page to steal Microsoft 365 or Google account credentials.</p>

<p>“The iframe design also allows attackers to easily switch out the phishing content, try new tricks or target specific regions, all without changing the main web page that distributes the kit,” Barracuda security researcher Sreyas Shetty
said
. “Further, by simply updating where the iframe points, the kit can avoid being detected by security tools that only check the outer page.”
Attacks using the GhostFrame kit commence with typical phishing emails that claim to be about business contracts, invoices, and password reset requests, but are designed to take recipients to the fake page. The kit uses anti-analysis and anti-debugging to prevent attempts to inspect it using browser developer tools, and generates a random subdomain each time someone visits the site. The visible outer pages come with a loader script that’s responsible for setting up the iframe and responding to any messages from the HTML element.</p>

<p>This can include changing the parent page’s title to impersonate trusted services, modifying the site favicon, or redirecting the top-level browser window to another domain. In the final stage, the victim is sent to a secondary page containing the actual phishing components through the iframe delivered via the constantly changing subdomain, thereby making it harder to block the threat. The kit also incorporates a fallback mechanism in the form of a backup iframe appended at the bottom of the page in the event the loader JavaScript fails or is blocked. InboxPrime AI Phishing Kit Automates Email Attacks
If BlackForce follows the same playbook as other traditional phishing kits, InboxPrime AI goes a step further by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to automate mass mailing campaigns.</p>

<p>It’s advertised on a 1,300-member-strong Telegram channel under a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) subscription model for $1,000, granting purchasers a perpetual license and full access to the source code. “It is designed to mimic real human emailing behavior and even leverages Gmail’s web interface to evade traditional filtering mechanisms,” Abnormal researchers Callie Baron and Piotr Wojtyla
said
. “InboxPrime AI blends artificial intelligence with operational evasion techniques and promises cybercriminals near-perfect deliverability, automated campaign generation, and a polished, professional interface that mirrors legitimate email marketing software.”
The platform employs a user-friendly interface that allows customers to manage accounts, proxies, templates, and campaigns, mirroring commercial email automation tools. One of its core features is a built-in AI-powered email generator, which can produce entire phishing emails, including the subject lines, in a manner that mimics legitimate business communication.</p>

<p>In doing so, these services further lower the barrier to entry for cybercrime, effectively eliminating the manual work that goes into drafting such emails. In its place, attackers can configure parameters, such as language, topic, or industry, email length, and desired tone, which the toolkit uses as inputs to generate convincing lures that match the chosen theme. What’s more, the dashboard enables users to save the produced email as a reusable template, complete with support for spintax to create variations of the email messages by substituting certain template variables. This ensures that no two phishing emails look identical and helps them bypass signature-based filters that look for similar content patterns.</p>

<p>Some of the other supported features in InboxPrime AI are listed below -
A real-time spam diagnostic module that can analyze a generated email for common spam-filter triggers and suggest precise corrections
Sender identity randomization and spoofing, enabling attackers to customize display names for each Gmail session
“This industrialization of phishing has direct implications for defenders: more attackers can now launch more campaigns with more volume, without any corresponding increase in defender bandwidth or resources,” Abnormal said. “This not only accelerates campaign launch time but also ensures consistent message quality, enables scalable, thematic targeting across industries, and empowers attackers to run professional-looking phishing operations without copywriting expertise.”
Spiderman Creates Pixel-Perfect Replicas of European Banks
The third phishing kit that has come under the cybersecurity radar is Spiderman, which permits attackers to target customers of dozens of European banks and online financial services providers, such as Blau, CaixaBank, Comdirect, Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank, ING, O2, Volksbank, Klarna, and PayPal. “Spiderman is a full-stack phishing framework that replicates dozens of European banking login pages, and even some government portals,” Varonis researcher Daniel Kelley
said
. “Its organized interface provides cybercriminals with an all-in-one platform to launch phishing campaigns, capture credentials, and manage stolen session data in real-time.”
What’s notable about the modular kit is that its seller is marketing the solution in a Signal messenger group that has about 750 members, marking a departure from Telegram.</p>

<p>Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Belgium are the primary targets of the phishing service. Like in the case of BlackForce, Spiderman utilizes various techniques like ISP allowlisting, geofencing, and device filtering to ascertain that only the intended targets can access the phishing pages. The toolkit is also equipped to capture cryptocurrency wallet seed phrases, intercept OTP and
PhotoTAN
codes, and trigger prompts to gather credit card data. “This flexible, multi-step approach is particularly effective in European banking fraud, where login credentials alone often aren’t enough to authorize transactions,” Kelley explained.</p>

<p>“After capturing credentials, Spiderman logs each session with a unique identifier so the attacker can maintain continuity through the entire phishing workflow.”
Hybrid Salty-Tycoon 2FA Attacks Spotted
BlackForce, GhostFrame, InboxPrime AI, and Spiderman are the latest additions to a long list of phishing kits like
Tycoon 2FA
,
Salty 2FA
,
Sneaky 2FA
,
Whisper 2FA
,
Cephas
, and
Astaroth
(not to be confused with a
Windows banking trojan
of the same name) that have emerged over the past year. In a report published earlier this month, ANY.RUN said it observed a new Salty-Tycoon hybrid that’s already bypassing detection rules tuned to either of them. The new attack wave coincides with a sharp drop in Salty 2FA activity in late October 2025, with early stages matching Salty2FA, while later stages load code that reproduces Tycoon 2FA’s execution chain. “This overlap marks a meaningful shift; one that weakens kit-specific rules, complicates attribution, and gives threat actors more room to slip past early detection,” the company
said
.</p>

<p>“Taken together, this provides clear evidence that a single phishing campaign, and, more interestingly, a single sample, contains traces of both Salty 2FA and Tycoon, with Tycoon serving as a fallback payload once the Salty infrastructure stopped working for reasons that are still unclear.”

<h2 id="securing-genai-in-the-browser-policy-isolation-and-data-controls-that-actually-work"><a id="article-12"></a>Securing GenAI in the Browser: Policy, Isolation, and Data Controls That Actually Work</h2>

<p>The browser has become the main interface to GenAI for most enterprises: from web-based LLMs and copilots, to GenAI‑powered extensions and agentic browsers like
ChatGPT Atlas
. Employees are leveraging the power of GenAI to draft emails, summarize documents, work on code, and analyze data, often by copying/pasting sensitive information directly into prompts or uploading files. Traditional security controls were not designed to understand this new prompt‑driven interaction pattern, leaving a critical blind spot where risk is highest. Security teams are simultaneously under pressure to enable more GenAI platforms because they clearly boost productivity.</p>

<p>Simply blocking AI is unrealistic. The more sustainable approach is to secure GenAI platforms where they are accessed by users: inside the browser session. The GenAI browser threat model
The GenAI‑in‑the‑browser threat model must be approached differently from traditional web browsing due to several key factors. Users routinely paste entire documents, code, customer records, or sensitive financial information into prompt windows.</p>

<p>This can lead to data exposure or long‑term retention in the LLM system. File uploads create similar risks when documents are processed outside of approved data‑handling pipelines or regional boundaries, putting organizations in jeopardy of violating regulations. GenAI browser extensions and assistants often require broad permissions to read and modify page content. This includes data from internal web apps that users never intended to share with external services.</p>

<p>Mixed use of personal and corporate accounts in the same browser profile complicates attribution and governance. All of these behaviors put together create a risk surface that is invisible to many legacy controls. Policy: defining safe use in the browser
A workable GenAI security strategy in the browser is a clear, enforceable policy that defines what “safe use” means. CISOs should categorize GenAI tools into sanctioned services and allow/disallow public tools and applications with different risk treatments and monitoring levels.</p>

<p>After setting clear boundaries, enterprises can then align browser‑level enforcement so that the user experience matches the policy intent. A strong policy consists of specifications around which data types are never allowed in GenAI prompts or uploads. Common restricted categories can include regulated personal data, financial details, legal information, trade secrets, and source code. The policy language should also be concrete and consistently enforced by technical controls rather than relying on user judgment.</p>

<p>Behavioral guardrails that users can live with
Beyond allowing or disallowing applications, enterprises need guardrails that define how employees should access and use GenAI in the browser. Requiring single sign‑on and corporate identities for all sanctioned GenAI services can improve visibility and control while reducing the likelihood that data ends up in unmanaged accounts. Exception handling is equally important, as teams such as research or marketing may require more permissive GenAI access. Others, like finance or legal, may need stricter guardrails.</p>

<p>A formal process for requesting policy exceptions, time‑based approvals, and review cycles allows flexibility. These behavioral elements make technical controls more predictable and acceptable to end users. Isolation: containing risk without harming productivity
Isolation is the second major pillar of securing browser-based GenAI use. Instead of a binary model, organizations can use specific approaches to reduce risk when GenAI is being accessed.</p>

<p>Dedicated browser profiles, for example, create boundaries between sensitive internal apps and GenAI‑heavy workflows. Per‑site and per‑session controls provide another layer of defense. For example, a security team may allow GenAI access to designated “safe” domains while restricting the ability of AI tools and extensions to read content from high‑sensitivity applications like ERP or HR systems. This approach enables employees to continue using GenAI for generic tasks while reducing the likelihood that confidential data is being shared with third‑party tools accessed inside the browser.</p>

<p>Data controls: precision DLP for prompts and pages
Policy defines the intent, and isolation limits exposure. Data controls provide the precise enforcement mechanism at the browser edge. Inspecting user actions like copy/paste, drag‑and‑drop, and file uploads at the point where they leave trusted apps and enter GenAI interfaces is critical. Effective implementations should support multiple enforcement modes: monitor‑only, user warnings, in‑time education, and hard blocks for clearly prohibited data types.</p>

<p>This tiered approach helps reduce user friction while preventing serious leaks. Managing GenAI browser extensions
GenAI‑powered browser extensions and side panels are a tricky risk category. Many offers convenient features like page summarizations, creating replies, or data extraction. But doing so often requires extensive permissions to read and modify page content, keystrokes, and clipboard data.</p>

<p>Without oversight, these extensions can become an exfiltration channel for sensitive information. CISOs must be aware of the AI‑powered extensions in use at their enterprise, classify them by risk level, and enforce a default‑deny or allowed with restrictions list. Using a Secure Enterprise Browser (SEB) for continuous monitoring of newly installed or updated extensions helps identify changes in permissions that may introduce new risks over time. Identity, accounts, and session hygiene
Identity
and session handling are central to GenAI browser security because they determine which data belongs to which account.</p>

<p>Enforcing SSO for sanctioned GenAI platforms and tying usage back to enterprise identities will simplify logging and incident response. Browser‑level controls can help prevent cross‑access between work and personal contexts. For example, organizations can block copying content from corporate apps into GenAI applications when the user has not been authenticated into a corporate account. Visibility, telemetry, and analytics
Ultimately, a working GenAI security program relies on accurate visibility into how employees are using browser-based GenAI tools.</p>

<p>Tacking which domains and apps are accessed, the contents being entered into prompts, and how often policies trigger warnings or blocks are all necessary. Aggregating this telemetry into existing logging and SIEM infrastructure allows security teams to identify patterns, outliers, and incidents. Analytics built on this data can help highlight genuine risk. For example, enterprises can make a clear determination between non‑sensitive vs proprietary source code being entered into prompts.</p>

<p>Using this information, SOC teams can refine rules, adjust isolation levels, and target training where it will provide the greatest impact. Change management and user education
CISOs with successful GenAI security programs invest in the time to explain the “why” behind restrictions. By sharing concrete scenarios that resonate with different roles, you can reduce the chances of your program failing - developers need examples related to IP, while sales and support staff benefit from stories about customer trust and contract details. Sharing scenario‑based content with relevant parties will reinforce good habits in the right moments.</p>

<p>When employees understand that guardrails are designed to preserve their ability to use GenAI at scale, not hinder them, they are more likely to follow the guidelines. Aligning communications with broader AI governance initiatives helps position browser‑level controls as part of a cohesive strategy rather than an isolated one. A practical 30‑day rollout approach
Many organizations are looking for a pragmatic path to move from ad‑hoc browser-based GenAI usage to a structured, policy‑driven model. One effective way of doing so is utilizing a Secure Enterprise Browsing (SEB) platform that can provide you with the visibility and reach needed.</p>

<p>With the right SEB you can map the current GenAI tools used within your enterprise, so you can create policy decisions like monitoring‑only or warn‑and‑educate modes for clearly risky behaviors. Over the following weeks, enforcement can be expanded to more users and higher‑risk data types, FAQs, and training. By the end of a 30‑day period, many organizations can formalize their GenAI browser policy, integrate alerts into SOC workflows, and establish a cadence for adjusting controls as usage evolves. Turning the browser into the GenAI control plane
As GenAI continues to spread across SaaS apps and web pages, the browser remains the central interface through which most employees access them.</p>

<p>The best GenAI protections simply cannot be worked into legacy perimeter controls. Enterprises can achieve the best results by treating the browser as the primary control plane. This approach enables security teams with meaningful ways to reduce data leakage and compliance risk while simultaneously preserving the productivity benefits that make GenAI so powerful. With well‑designed policies, measured isolation strategies, and browser‑native data protections, CISOs can move from reactive blocking to confident, large‑scale enablement of GenAI across their entire workforce.</p>

<h2 id="new-react-rsc-vulnerabilities-enable-dos-and-source-code-exposure"><a id="article-13"></a>New React RSC Vulnerabilities Enable DoS and Source Code Exposure</h2>

<p>The React team has
released
fixes for two new types of flaws in React Server Components (RSC) that, if successfully exploited, could result in denial-of-service (DoS) or source code exposure. The team said the issues were found by the security community while attempting to exploit the patches released for CVE-2025-55182 (CVSS score: 10.0), a critical bug in RSC that has since been
weaponized in the wild
. The three vulnerabilities are listed below -
CVE-2025-55184
(CVSS score: 7.5) - A pre-authentication denial of service vulnerability arising from unsafe deserialization of payloads from HTTP requests to Server Function endpoints, triggering an infinite loop that hangs the server process and may prevent future HTTP requests from being served
CVE-2025-67779
(CVSS score: 7.5) - An incomplete fix for CVE-2025-55184 that has the same impact
CVE-2025-55183
(CVSS score: 5.3) - An information leak vulnerability that may cause a specifically crafted HTTP request sent to a vulnerable Server Function to return the source code of any Server Function
However, successful exploitation of CVE-2025-55183 requires the existence of a Server Function that explicitly or implicitly exposes an argument that has been converted into a string format. The flaws affecting the following versions of react-server-dom-parcel, react-server-dom-turbopack, and react-server-dom-webpack -
CVE-2025-55184 and CVE-2025-55183</p>
<ul>
  <li>19.0.0, 19.0.1 19.1.0, 19.1.1, 19.1.2, 19.2.0 and 19.2.1
CVE-2025-67779</li>
  <li>19.0.2, 19.1.3 and 19.2.2
Security researchers RyotaK and Shinsaku Nomura have been credited with reporting the two DoS bugs to the Meta Bug Bounty program, while Andrew MacPherson has been acknowledged for reporting the information leak flaw.</li>
</ul>

<p>Users are advised to update to
versions 19.0.3, 19.1.4, and 19.2.3
as soon as possible, particularly in light of active exploration of CVE-2025-55182. “When a critical vulnerability is disclosed, researchers scrutinize adjacent code paths looking for variant exploit techniques to test whether the initial mitigation can be bypassed,” the React team said. “This pattern shows up across the industry, not just in JavaScript. Additional disclosures can be frustrating, but they are generally a sign of a healthy response cycle.”

<h2 id="react2shell-exploitation-escalates-into-large-scale-global-attacks-forcing-emergency-mitigation"><a id="article-14"></a>React2Shell Exploitation Escalates into Large-Scale Global Attacks, Forcing Emergency Mitigation</h2>

<p>The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has
urged
federal agencies to patch the recent
React2Shell
vulnerability by December 12, 2025, amid reports of widespread exploitation. The critical vulnerability, tracked as
CVE-2025-55182
(CVSS score: 10.0), affects the React Server Components (RSC) Flight protocol. The underlying cause of the issue is an unsafe deserialization that allows an attacker to inject malicious logic that the server executes in a privileged context.</p>

<p>It also affects other frameworks, including Next.js, Waku, Vite, React Router, and RedwoodSDK. “A single, specially crafted HTTP request is sufficient; there is no authentication requirement, user interaction, or elevated permissions involved,” Cloudforce One, Cloudflare’s threat intelligence team,
said
. “Once successful, the attacker can execute arbitrary, privileged JavaScript on the affected server.”
Since its public disclosure on December 3, 2025, the shortcoming has been
exploited
by
multiple threat actors
in
various campaigns
to engage in reconnaissance efforts and deliver a wide range of malware families. The development
prompted
CISA to add it to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog last Friday, giving federal agencies until December 26 to apply the fixes.</p>

<p>The deadline has since been
revised
to December 12, 2025, an indication of the severity of the incident. Cloud security company Wiz
said
it has observed a “rapid wave of opportunistic exploitation” of the flaw, with a vast majority of the attacks targeting internet-facing Next.js applications and other containerized workloads running in Kubernetes and managed cloud services. Image Source: Cloudflare
Cloudflare, which is also tracking ongoing exploitation activity, said threat actors have conducted searches using internet-wide scanning and asset discovery platforms to find exposed systems running React and Next.js applications. Notably, some of the reconnaissance efforts have excluded Chinese IP address spaces from their searches.</p>

<p>“Their highest-density probing occurred against networks in Taiwan, Xinjiang Uyghur, Vietnam, Japan, and New Zealand – regions frequently associated with geopolitical intelligence collection priorities,” the web infrastructure company said. The observed activity is also said to have targeted, albeit more selectively, government (.gov) websites, academic research institutions, and critical‑infrastructure operators. This included a national authority responsible for the import and export of uranium, rare metals, and nuclear fuel. Some of the other notable findings are listed below -
Prioritizing high‑sensitivity technology targets such as enterprise password managers and secure‑vault services, likely with the goal of perpetrating supply chain attacks
Targeting edge‑facing SSL VPN appliances whose administrative interfaces may incorporate React-based components
Early scanning and exploitation attempts originated from IP addresses previously associated with Asia-affiliated threat clusters
In its own analysis of honeypot data, Kaspersky
said
it recorded over 35,000 exploitation attempts on a single day on December 10, 2025, with the attackers first probing the system by running commands like whoami, before dropping cryptocurrency miners or botnet malware families like Mirai/Gafgyt variants and RondoDox.</p>

<p>Some of the other
observed payloads
include Cobalt Strike beacons, Sliver, Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP), a monitoring tool named
Nezha
, a Node.js payload that harvests sensitive files and weaponizes TruffleHog and Gitleaks to collect secrets, and a Go-based backdoor with reverse shell, reconnaissance, and command-and-control (C2) capabilities. In parallel, React2Shell is estimated to have produced over 140 in-the-wild proof-of-concept exploits of varying quality, with about half of them broken, misleading, or otherwise unusable, per
VulnCheck
. The remaining exploit repositories contain logic to load in-memory web shells like
Godzilla
,
scan for the flaw
, and even deploy a lightweight web application firewall (WAF) to block malicious payloads. Security researcher Rakesh Krishnan has also
discovered
an open directory hosted on “154.61.77[.]105:8082” that includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit script for CVE-2025–55182 along with two other files -
“domains.txt,” which contains a list of 35,423 domains
“next_target.txt,” which contains a list of 596 URLs, including companies like Dia Browser, Starbucks, Porsche, and Lululemon
It has been assessed that the unidentified threat actor is actively scanning the internet based on targets added to the second file, infecting hundreds of pages in the process.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity and cyber insurance company Coalition has
likened
React2Shell to the 2021 Log4Shell vulnerability (
CVE-2021-44228
), describing it as a “systemic cyber risk aggregation event.”
According to the latest data from The Shadowserver Foundation, there are more than
137,200 internet-exposed IP addresses
running vulnerable code as of December 11, 2025. Of these, over
88,900 instances
are located in the U.S., followed by Germany (10,900), France (5,500), and India (3,600). Found this article interesting? Follow us on
