<h2 id="two-chrome-extensions-caught-secretly-stealing-credentials-from-over-170-sites"><a id="article-1"></a>Two Chrome Extensions Caught Secretly Stealing Credentials from Over 170 Sites</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have
discovered
two malicious Google Chrome extensions with the same name and published by the same developer that come with capabilities to intercept traffic and capture user credentials. The extensions are advertised as a “multi-location network speed test plug-in” for developers and foreign trade personnel. Both the browser add-ons are available for download as of writing. The details of the extensions are as follows -
Phantom Shuttle (ID: fbfldogmkadejddihifklefknmikncaj) - 2,000 users (Published on November 26, 2017)
Phantom Shuttle (ID: ocpcmfmiidofonkbodpdhgddhlcmcofd) - 180 users (Published on April 27, 2023)
“Users pay subscriptions ranging from ¥9.9 to ¥95.9 CNY ($1.40 to $13.50 USD), believing they’re purchasing a legitimate VPN service, but both variants perform identical malicious operations,” Socket security researcher Kush Pandya said.</p>

<p>“Behind the subscription facade, the extensions execute complete traffic interception through authentication credential injection, operate as man-in-the-middle proxies, and continuously exfiltrate user data to the threat actor’s C2 [command-and-control] server.”
Once unsuspecting users make the payment, they receive VIP status and the extensions auto-enable “smarty” proxy mode, which routes traffic from over 170 targeted domains through the C2 infrastructure. The extensions work as advertised to reinforce the illusion of a functional product. They perform actual latency tests on proxy servers and display connection status, while keeping users in the dark about their main goal, which is to intercept network traffic and steal credentials. This involves malicious modifications prepended to two JavaScript libraries, namely, jquery-1.12.2.min.js and scripts.js, that come bundled with the extensions.</p>

<p>The code is designed to automatically inject hard-coded proxy credentials (topfany / 963852wei) into every HTTP authentication challenge across all websites by registering a listener on chrome.webRequest.onAuthRequired. “When any website or service requests HTTP authentication (Basic Auth, Digest Auth, or proxy authentication), this listener fires before the browser displays a credential prompt,” Pandya explained. “It immediately responds with the hardcoded proxy credentials, completely transparent to the user. The asyncBlocking mode ensures synchronous credential injection, preventing any user interaction.”
Once users authenticate to a proxy server, the extension configures Chrome’s proxy settings using a Proxy Auto-Configuration (
PAC
) script to implement three modes -
close, which disables the proxy feature
always, which routes all web traffic through the proxy
smarty, which routes a hard-coded list of more than 170 high-value domains through the proxy
The list of domains includes developer platforms (GitHub, Stack Overflow, Docker), cloud services (Amazon Web Services, Digital Ocean, Microsoft Azure), enterprise solutions (Cisco, IBM, VMware), social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter), and adult content sites.</p>

<p>The inclusion of pornographic sites is likely an attempt to blackmail victims, Socket theorized. The net result of this behavior is that user web traffic is routed through threat actor-controlled proxies while the extension maintains a 60-second heartbeat to its C2 server at phantomshuttle[.]space, a domain that remains operational. It also grants the attacker a “man-in-the-middle” (MitM) position to capture traffic, manipulate responses, and inject arbitrary payloads. More importantly, the heartbeat message transmits a VIP user’s email, password in plaintext, and version number to an external server via an HTTP GET request every five minutes for continuous credential exfiltration and session monitoring.</p>

<p>“The combination of heartbeat exfiltration (credentials and metadata) plus proxy MitM (real-time traffic capture) provides comprehensive data theft capabilities operating continuously while the extension remains active,” Socket said. Put differently, the extension captures passwords, credit card numbers, authentication cookies, browsing history, form data, API keys, and access tokens from users accessing the targeted domains while VIP mode is active. What’s more, the theft of developer secrets could pave the way for supply chain attacks. It’s currently not known who is behind the eight-year-old operation, but the use of Chinese language in the extension description, the presence of Alipay/WeChat Pay integration to make payments, and the use of Alibaba Cloud to host the C2 domain points to a China-based operation.</p>

<p>“The subscription model creates victim retention while generating revenue, and the professional infrastructure with payment integration presents a facade of legitimacy,” Socket said. “Users believe they’re
purchasing a VPN service
while unknowingly enabling complete traffic compromise.”
The findings highlight how browser-based extensions are becoming an unmanaged risk layer for enterprises. Users who have installed the extensions are advised to remove them as soon as possible. For security teams, it’s essential to deploy extension allowlisting, monitor for extensions with subscription payment systems combined with proxy permissions, and implement network monitoring for suspicious proxy authentication attempts.</p>

<h2 id="interpol-arrests-574-in-africa-ukrainian-ransomware-affiliate-pleads-guilty"><a id="article-2"></a>INTERPOL Arrests 574 in Africa; Ukrainian Ransomware Affiliate Pleads Guilty</h2>

<p>A law enforcement operation coordinated by INTERPOL has led to the recovery of $3 million and the arrest of 574 suspects by authorities from 19 countries, amidst a continued crackdown on cybercrime networks in Africa. The coordinated effort, named Operation Sentinel,
took place
between October 27 and November 27, 2025, and mainly focused on business email compromise (BEC), digital extortion, and ransomware on the continent. Participating nations included Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Congo, Djibouti, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, South Sudan, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Over the course of the initiative, more than 6,000 malicious links were taken down and six distinct ransomware variants were decrypted.</p>

<p>The names of the ransomware families were not disclosed. The investigated incidents were linked to estimated financial losses exceeding $21 million, INTERPOL added. Multiple suspects have been arrested in connection with a ransomware attack targeting an unnamed Ghanaian financial institution that encrypted 100 terabytes of data and stole about $120,000. In addition, Ghanaian authorities took down a cyber fraud network operating across Ghana and Nigeria that defrauded more than 200 victims of over $400,000 using well-designed websites and mobile apps, which impersonated popular fast-food brands to collect payments for fake orders.</p>

<p>As part of the effort, 10 individuals were apprehended, 100 digital devices were seized, and 30 fraudulent servers were taken offline. Law enforcement from Benin also dismantled 43 malicious domains and 4,318 social media accounts that were used to further extortion schemes and scams. The operation culminated in the arrest of 106 people. “The scale and sophistication of cyber attacks across Africa are accelerating, especially against critical sectors like finance and energy,” Neal Jetton, INTERPOL’s director of cybercrime, said.</p>

<p>Operation Sentinel is part of the African Joint Operation against Cybercrime (
AFJOC
), which aims to enhance the capabilities of national law enforcement agencies in Africa and better disrupt cybercriminal activity in the region. Ukrainian National Pleads Guilty to Nefilim Ransomware Attacks
The disclosure comes as a 35-year-old from Ukraine
pleaded guilty
in the U.S. to using Nefilim ransomware to attack companies in the country and elsewhere in his capacity as an affiliate. Artem Aleksandrovych Stryzhak was arrested in Spain in June 2024 and
extradited to the U.S.</p>

<p>earlier this April. In September, the Justice Department (DoJ)
charged
another Ukrainian national, Volodymyr Viktorovich Tymoshchuk, for his role as the administrator of the LockerGoga, MegaCortex, and Nefilim ransomware operations between December 2018 and October 2021. Tymoshchuk remains at large, although authorities have announced a $11 million reward for information leading to his arrest or conviction. Tymoshchuk is also on the most wanted lists of both the U.S.</p>

<p>Federal Bureau of Investigation (
FBI
) and the European Union (
E.U. ). Nefilim’s victims span the U.S., Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, and Switzerland. “In June 2021, Nefilim administrators gave Stryzhak access to the Nefilim ransomware code in exchange for 20 percent of his ransom proceeds,” the DoJ said.</p>

<p>“Stryzhak and others researched potential victims after gaining unauthorized access to their networks, including by using online databases to obtain information about the companies’ net worth, size, and contact information.”
Around July 2021, a Nefilim administrator is said to have encouraged Stryzhak to target companies in the U.S., Canada, and Australia with more than $200 million dollars in annual revenue. Nefilim operated under a double extortion model, pressurizing victims to pay up or risk getting their stolen data published on a publicly accessible data leaks site known as Corporate Leaks that was maintained by the administrators. Stryzhak pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud related to computers in connection with his Nefilim ransomware activities. He is scheduled to be sentenced on May 6, 2026.</p>

<p>If found guilty, he faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. Found this article interesting? Follow us on

<h2 id="passwd-a-walkthrough-of-the-google-workspace-password-manager"><a id="article-3"></a>Passwd: A walkthrough of the Google Workspace Password Manager</h2>

<p>Passwd
is designed specifically for organizations operating within Google Workspace. Rather than competing as a general consumer password manager, its purpose is narrow, and business-focused: secure credential storage, controlled sharing, and seamless Workspace integration. The platform emphasizes practicality over feature overload, aiming to provide a reliable system for teams that already rely on Google’s tools. Security as the starting point
Encryption and data protection are the basic building blocks of Passwd.</p>

<p>Every credential, file, or sensitive asset gets encrypted with AES-256, an extremely secure encryption standard that is widely recognized. Encryption happens before storage, keeping data protected throughout its lifecycle. Passwd is based on a zero-knowledge architecture; only the users, not Passwd, are able to access decrypted data. It does not have any visibility of the stored passwords or secrets.</p>

<p>The structure reflects an enterprise mindset:
Centralized admin control
Granular, role-based permissions
Visibility into credential access and changes
Clear organizational hierarchy
Security assurance is further supported by
SOC 2 and GDPR readiness
, through documentation and controls for businesses that need to adhere to regulated compliance standards. Along with encryption and zero-knowledge design, these certifications reinforce the security posture of the platform. Audit logs
and access tracking provide visibility into who has viewed, shared, or changed credentials in the system. This is helpful in a number of ways when it comes to compliance, internal audits, and security reviews.</p>

<p>From a reliability perspective, Passwd has minimal downtime. Though Google updates caused disruptions, they have only been short-lived. There have not been any data breaches to date. Integration designed for Google Workspace
Where most password managers extend across multiple ecosystems, Passwd stays firmly within Google’s.</p>

<p>The platform connects directly to Google Workspace for identity management, making onboarding and administration easier. Because authentication is done via Google OAuth, users sign in with their existing Google accounts, with no new master passwords, credentials, or login systems to maintain. This reduces credential sprawl and eliminates separate password databases. For teams used to Gmail, Drive, Docs, or Google Admin Console, the setup feels intuitively familiar.</p>

<p>Deployments take mere minutes rather than requiring IT restructuring. This focus also creates clarity about the intended environment in which Passwd will operate: Passwd works only inside the Google Workspace ecosystem and cannot be used with external identity providers. Passwd includes Google SSO support, allowing for a passwordless login experience. The service also provides audit logging, which gives administrators insight into who has accessed credentials and when.</p>

<p>Reports indicate it scales effectively for several hundred employees, and its pricing model eliminates additional fees once a company has more than 301 users, making it appealing to larger teams. How teams use Passwd Day-to-Day
When activated, Passwd turns into a shared storage system in which groups can securely organize:
Passwords and logins
SSH keys
API credentials
Database access
Payment information
Internal tools or system accounts
Sharing can be temporary or permanent, by individuals or groups. Permissions control a user’s level of access to a record: whether they can view it, edit it, or manage it. Activity tracking enables a team to understand how its credentials are being accessed and by whom.</p>

<p>Role-based access, sharing links, and detailed audit trails support common workplace scenarios, new employee onboarding, transitions between departments, or restricted administrative access. Passwd’s Premium plans include unlimited records and users, designed to scale with an organization as it grows. The plan tier determines the features available, allowing businesses to adopt the level that fits their workflows. Cross-platform access and usage
Passwd provides wide device compatibility with a lightweight footprint:
Web access through any browser
Chrome, Edge, and Firefox
extensions
Android and iOS
mobile apps
Browser extensions help autofill records and credential capture without requiring large desktop applications.</p>

<p>This cross-platform consistency allows users to transition easily from device to device without changing how they interact with stored data. Built-in tools and functionality
Passwd contains the essential password-management utilities:
A password generator able to create secure, random passwords
Auditing tools
for credentials that are weak, reused, or outdated
Tags
that give organization to records
The interface is free of complicated add-ons, favoring a clean, straightforward layout: search, filtering, and record editing are easily located and used. Pricing structure and value
The pricing of Passwd
is designed for organizational usage, rather than individual licensing. The
Workspace plan
starts from
$19 per month
, including unlimited stored records.</p>

<p>A per-user pricing option is available for smaller teams or departments that aren’t using Workspace organization-wide, though the pay-per-workspace model may offer better overall efficiency. A
free Starter Plan
allows unlimited users and up to 15 stored records, so it is highly accessible for small teams or early testing. The
Enterprise plan
is ideal for organizations that require GDPR and SOC2 compliance, alongside advanced user monitoring. Its most exceptional benefit is that it lets you host the password manager inside your very own Google Cloud project, an uncommon capability and an important added value in comparison to other team password managers.</p>

<p>This puts Passwd in the position of being an entry-level enterprise product, but without the need for enterprise-level pricing. Customer feedback and observed reception
Passwd maintains a 4.7-star rating across the third-party review platforms, including Trustpilot and G2. Feedback often points out that:
Smooth integration with Google Workspace
Fast onboarding through Google Identity
Easier credential sharing across teams
Clear access governance using Google Groups
Smaller teams often mention that the free tier provides enough functionality for centralized storage and secure sharing, while larger organizations use Passwd for its onboarding and role transitions. Where Passwd fits and where it doesn’t
Based on its structure and feature set, Passwd aligns most naturally with organizations that:
Already use Google Workspace company-wide
Prefer a unified identity and authentication system
Share passwords or credentials across teams
Want admin visibility, compliance support, and access logs
Need a scalable approach without paying per-seat licensing
However, Passwd is less applicable for organizations that:
Require integrations beyond Google’s ecosystem
Use multiple or diverse identity providers
Operate outside Google Workspace environments
Its design intentionally prioritizes Workspace compatibility over platform versatility.</p>

<p>Overview of closing walkthrough
A walkthrough of Passwd shows a password manager featuring predictability, efficiency, and organizational alignment rather than feature saturation. Its role is clear: provide strong encryption, controlled collaboration, compliance-ready visibility, and seamless Google authentication. For teams already living inside Google Workspace, Passwd becomes an extension of the workflows that are already in place, not another tool to manage, and handles shared credentials, enforces access governance, and protects sensitive information in a safe, structured manner.

<h2 id="us-doj-seizes-fraud-domain-behind-146-million-bank-account-takeover-scheme"><a id="article-4"></a>U.S. DoJ Seizes Fraud Domain Behind $14.6 Million Bank Account Takeover Scheme</h2>

<p>The U.S. Justice Department (DoJ) on Monday announced the seizure of a web domain and database that it said was used to further a criminal scheme designed to target and defraud Americans by means of bank account takeover fraud. The domain in question, web3adspanels[.]org, was used as a backend web panel to host and manipulate illegally harvested bank login credentials. Users to the website are now greeted by a seizure banner that says the domain was taken down in an international law enforcement operation led by authorities from the U.S.</p>

<p>and Estonia. “The criminal group perpetrating the bank account takeover fraud delivered fraudulent advertisements through search engines, including Google and Bing,” the DoJ
said
. “These fraudulent advertisements imitate the sponsored search engine advertisements used by legitimate banking entities.”
The ads served as a conduit to redirect unsuspecting users to fake bank websites operated by the threat actors, who harvested login credentials entered by victims through an unspecified malicious software program built into the sites. The stolen credentials were then used by the criminals to sign into legitimate bank websites to take over victims’ accounts and drain their funds.</p>

<p>The scheme is estimated to have claimed 19 victims across the U.S. to date, including two companies in the Northern District of Georgia, leading to attempted losses of approximately $28 million and actual losses of approximately $14.6 million. The DoJ said the confiscated domain stored the stolen login credentials of thousands of victims, in addition to hosting a backend server to facilitate takeover fraud as recently as last month. According to information shared by the U.S.</p>

<p>Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) has
received
more than 5,100 complaints related to bank account takeover fraud since January 2025, with reported losses upwards of $262 million. Users are advised to exercise caution when sharing about themselves online or on social media; regularly monitor accounts for any financial irregularities; use unique, complex passwords; ensure the correctness of banking website URLs before signing in; and stay vigilant against phishing attacks or suspicious callers.

<h2 id="critical-n8n-flaw-cvss-99-enables-arbitrary-code-execution-across-thousands-of-instances"><a id="article-5"></a>Critical n8n Flaw (CVSS 9.9) Enables Arbitrary Code Execution Across Thousands of Instances</h2>

<p>A critical security vulnerability has been disclosed in the
n8n
workflow automation platform that, if successfully exploited, could result in arbitrary code execution under certain circumstances. The vulnerability, tracked as
CVE-2025-68613
, carries a CVSS score of 9.9 out of a maximum of 10.0. The package has about 57,000 weekly downloads, according to statistics on npm. “Under certain conditions, expressions supplied by authenticated users during workflow configuration may be evaluated in an execution context that is not sufficiently isolated from the underlying runtime,” the maintainers of the npm package
said
.</p>

<p>“An authenticated attacker could abuse this behavior to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the n8n process. Successful exploitation may lead to full compromise of the affected instance, including unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of workflows, and execution of system-level operations.”
The issue, which affects all versions including and higher than 0.211.0 and below 1.120.4, has been patched in 1.120.4, 1.121.1, and 1.122.0. Per the attack surface management platform Censys, there are
103,476 potentially vulnerable instances
as of December 22, 2025. A majority of the instances are located in the U.S., Germany, France, Brazil, and Singapore.</p>

<p>In light of the criticality of the flaw, users are advised to apply the updates as soon as possible. If immediate patching is not an option, it’s advised to limit workflow creation and editing permissions to trusted users and deploy n8n in a hardened environment with restricted operating system privileges and network access to mitigate the risk.

<h2 id="fcc-bans-foreign-made-drones-and-key-parts-over-us-national-security-risks"><a id="article-7"></a>FCC Bans Foreign-Made Drones and Key Parts Over U.S. National Security Risks</h2>

<p>The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Monday
announced
a ban on all drones and critical components made in a foreign country, citing national security concerns. To that end, the agency has added to its
Covered List
Uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS) and UAS critical components produced in a foreign country, and all communications and video surveillance equipment and services pursuant to the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act (
NDAA
). This move will keep China-made drones such as those from DJI and Autel Robotics out of the U.S.</p>

<p>market. The FCC said that while drones offer the potential to enhance public safety and innovation, criminals, hostile foreign actors, and terrorists can weaponize them to present serious threats to the U.S. It also noted that a further review by an Executive Branch interagency body with appropriate national security expertise that was convened by the White House led to a “specific determination” that UAS and UAS critical component parts produced in foreign countries pose “unacceptable risks to the national security of the United States and to the safety and security of U.S. persons.”
The decision, it said, is being taken to safeguard Americans and restore American airspace sovereignty as the country prepares to host several mass-gathering events in the coming years, including the 2026 FIFA World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics.</p>

<p>“UAS and UAS critical components must be produced in the United States,” the FCC said. “This will reduce the risk of direct UAS attacks and disruptions, unauthorized surveillance, sensitive data exfiltration, and other UAS threats to the homeland.”
“UAS and UAS critical components, including data transmission devices, communications systems, flight controllers, ground control stations, controllers, navigation systems, batteries, smart batteries, and motors produced in a foreign country, could enable persistent surveillance, data exfiltration, and destructive operations over U.S. territory.”
The FCC noted that specific drones or components would be exempt if the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) determined they did not pose such risks.</p>

<p>The ban, however, does not impact a consumer’s ability to continue using drones they previously purchased, nor prevent retailers from continuing to sell, import, or market device models that were approved by the government this year. The development comes a week after U.S. President Donald Trump
signed into law
the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026, which includes provisions to secure airspace against unmanned aircraft when they present a threat to the public. In late July 2024, the Covered List was
updated
to include Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky, preventing it from directly or indirectly offering its security software in the country.</p>

<h2 id="fake-whatsapp-api-package-on-npm-steals-messages-contacts-and-login-tokens"><a id="article-8"></a>Fake WhatsApp API Package on npm Steals Messages, Contacts, and Login Tokens</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a new malicious package on the npm repository that works as a fully functional WhatsApp API, but also contains the ability to intercept every message and link the attacker’s device to a victim’s WhatsApp account. The package, named “
lotusbail
,” has been downloaded
over 56,000 times
since it was first uploaded to the registry by a user named “seiren_primrose” in May 2025. Of these, 711 downloads took place over the last week. The library is still available for download as of writing.</p>

<p>Under the cover of a functional tool, the malware “steals your WhatsApp credentials, intercepts every message, harvests your contacts, installs a persistent backdoor, and encrypts everything before sending it to the threat actor’s server,” Koi Security researcher Tuval Admoni
said
in a report published over the weekend. Specifically, it’s equipped to capture authentication tokens and session keys, message history, contact lists with phone numbers, as well as media files and documents. More significantly, the library is inspired by
@whiskeysockets/baileys
, a legitimate WebSockets-based TypeScript library for interacting with the WhatsApp Web API. This is accomplished by means of a malicious WebSocket wrapper through which authentication information and messages are routed, thereby allowing it to capture credentials and chats.</p>

<p>The stolen data is transmitted to an attacker-controlled URL in encrypted form. The attack doesn’t stop there, for the package also harbors covert functionality to create persistent access to the victim’s WhatsApp account by hijacking the
device linking process
by using a hard-coded pairing code. “When you use this library to authenticate, you’re not just linking your application – you’re also linking the threat actor’s device,” Admoni said. “They have complete, persistent access to your WhatsApp account, and you have no idea they’re there.”
By linking their device to the target’s WhatsApp, it not only allows continued access to their contacts and conversations but also enables persistent access even after the package is uninstalled from the system, given the threat actor’s device remains linked to the WhatsApp account until it’s unlinked by navigating to the app’s settings.</p>

<p>Koi Security’s Idan Dardikman told The Hacker News that the malicious activity is triggered when the developer uses the library to connect to WhatsApp. “The malware wraps the WebSocket client, so once you authenticate and start sending/receiving messages, the interception kicks in,” Dardikman said. “No special function needed beyond normal usage of the API. The backdoor pairing code also activates during the authentication flow – so the attacker’s device gets linked the moment you connect your app to WhatsApp.”
Furthermore, “lotusbail” comes fitted with anti-debugging capabilities that cause it to enter into an infinite loop trap when debugging tools are detected, causing it to freeze execution.</p>

<p>“Supply chain attacks aren’t slowing down – they’re getting better,” Koi said. “Traditional security doesn’t catch this. Static analysis sees working WhatsApp code and approves it. Reputation systems have seen 56,000 downloads, and trust it.</p>

<p>The malware hides in the gap between ‘this code works’ and ‘this code only does what it claims.’”
Malicious NuGet Packages Target the Crypto Ecosystem
The disclosure comes as ReversingLabs
shared
details of 14 malicious NuGet packages that impersonate Nethereum, a .NET integration library for the Ethereum decentralized blockchain, and other cryptocurrency-related tools to redirect transaction funds to attacker-controlled wallets when the transfer amount exceeded $100 or exfiltrate private keys and seed phrases. The names of the packages, published from eight different accounts, are listed below -
binance.csharp
bitcoincore
bybitapi.net
coinbase.net.api
googleads.api
nbitcoin.unified
nethereumnet
nethereumunified
netherеum.all
solananet
solnetall
solnetall.net
solnetplus
solnetunified
The packages have leveraged several techniques to lull users into a false sense of trust in security, including inflating download counts and publishing dozens of new versions in a short amount of time to give the impression that it’s being actively maintained. The campaign dates all the way back to July 2025. The malicious functionality is injected such that it’s only triggered when the packages are installed by developers and specific functions are embedded into other applications.</p>

<p>Notable among the packages is GoogleAds.API, which focuses on stealing Google Ads OAuth information instead of exfiltrating wallet data secrets. “These values are highly sensitive, because they allow full programmatic access to a Google Ads account and, if leaked, attackers can impersonate the victim’s advertising client, read all campaign and performance data, create or modify ads, and even spend unlimited funds on a malicious or fraudulent campaign,” ReversingLabs said.

<h2 id="-weekly-recap-firewall-exploits-ai-data-theft-android-hacks-apt-attacks-insider-leaks--more"><a id="article-9"></a>⚡ Weekly Recap: Firewall Exploits, AI Data Theft, Android Hacks, APT Attacks, Insider Leaks &amp; More</h2>

<p>Cyber threats last week showed how attackers no longer need big hacks to cause big damage. They’re going after the everyday tools we trust most — firewalls, browser add-ons, and even smart TVs — turning small cracks into serious breaches. The real danger now isn’t just one major attack, but hundreds of quiet ones using the software and devices already inside our networks. Each trusted system can become an entry point if it’s left unpatched or overlooked.</p>

<p>Here’s a clear look at the week’s biggest risks, from exploited network flaws to new global campaigns and fast-moving vulnerabilities. ⚡ Threat of the Week
Flaws in Multiple Network Security Products Come Under Attack
— Over the past week,
Fortinet
,
SonicWall
,
Cisco
, and
WatchGuard
said vulnerabilities in their products have been exploited by threat actors in real-world attacks. Cisco said attacks exploiting CVE-2025-20393, a critical flaw in AsyncOS, have been abused by a China-nexus advanced persistent threat (APT) actor codenamed UAT-9686 to deliver malware such as ReverseSSH (aka AquaTunnel), Chisel, AquaPurge, and AquaShell. The flaw remains unpatched.</p>

<p>SonicWall said attacks exploiting CVE-2025-40602, a local privilege escalation flaw impacting Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 100 series appliances, have been observed in connection with CVE-2025-23006 (CVSS score 9.8) to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution with root privileges. The development comes as firewalls and edge appliances have become a favorite target for attackers, giving attackers deeper visibility into traffic, VPN connections, and downstream systems.

Featured Chrome Extension Caught Harvesting AI Chats
— Urban VPN Proxy, a Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge extension, with more than 7.3 installations, was observed stealthily gathering every prompt entered by users into artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbots like OpenAI ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude, Microsoft Copilot, DeepSeek, Google Gemini, xAI Grok, Meta AI, and Perplexity. Three other extensions from the same developer, 1ClickVPN Proxy, Urban Browser Guard, and Urban Ad Blocker, were also updated with similar functionality.</p>

<p>Collectively, these add-ons were installed more than eight million times. The extensions are no longer available for download from the Chrome Web Store. Ink Dragon Targets Governments with ShadowPad and FINALDRAFT
— The threat actor known as Jewelbug (CL-STA-0049, Earth Alux, Ink Dragon, and REF7707) has been increasingly focusing on government targets in Europe since July 2025, even as it continues to attack entities located in Southeast Asia and South America. The campaign has “impacted several dozen victims, including government entities and telecommunications organizations, across Europe, Asia, and Africa.” Ink Dragon does not merely use victims for data theft but actively repurposes them to support ongoing operations against other targets of interest.</p>

<p>This creates a self-sustaining infrastructure that obscures the true origin of the attacks while maximizing the utility of every compromised asset. Kimwolf Botnet Hijacks 1.8 Million Android TVs
— A new botnet named Kimwolf is powered by no less than 1.8 million Android TVs. Infections are scattered globally, with Brazil, India, the U.S., Argentina, South Africa, and the Philippines registering higher concentrations. Kimwolf is believed to share its origins with AISURU, which has been behind some of the record-breaking DDoS attacks over the past year.</p>

<p>It’s suspected that the attackers reused code from AISURU in the early stages, before opting to develop the Kimwolf botnet to evade detection. QiAnXin XLab said it’s possible some of these attacks may not have come from AISURU alone, and that Kimwolf may be either participating or even leading the efforts. LongNosedGoblin Uses Group Policy For Malware Deployment
— A previously undocumented China-aligned threat cluster dubbed LongNosedGoblin has been attributed to a series of cyber attacks targeting governmental entities in Southeast Asia and Japan. Central to the group’s tradecraft is the abuse of Group Policy to deploy malware across the compromised network and cloud services for communication with infected endpoints using a backdoor dubbed NosyDoor.</p>

<p>The threat actor is believed to be active since at least September 2023. The exact initial access methods used in the attacks are presently unknown. Kimsuky Uses DocSwap Android Malware
— The North Korean threat actor known as Kimsuky has been linked to a new campaign that distributes a new variant of Android data gathering malware called DocSwap via QR codes hosted on phishing sites mimicking Seoul-based logistics firm CJ Logistics (formerly CJ Korea Express). The apps masquerade as package delivery service apps.</p>

<p>It’s believed that the threat actors are using smishing texts or phishing emails impersonating delivery companies to deceive recipients into clicking on booby-trapped URLs hosting the apps. A noteworthy aspect of the attack is its QR code-based mobile redirection, which prompts users visiting the URLs from a desktop computer to scan a QR code displayed on the page on their Android device to install the supposed shipment tracking app and look up the status. ‎️‍🔥 Trending CVEs

<p>📰 Around the Cyber World
FBI Warns of Campaigns Impersonating Government Officials
— The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has warned that malicious actors have impersonated senior U.S. state government, White House, and Cabinet-level officials, as well as members of Congress, to target individuals, including officials’ family members and personal acquaintances, since at least 2023. The “Malicious actors have sent text messages and AI-generated voice messages — techniques known as smishing and vishing, respectively — that claim to come from a senior U.S.</p>

<p>official to establish rapport with targeted individuals,” the FBI
said
. “In the scheme, actors contact an individual and briefly engage on a topic the victim is versed on, with a request to move communication to a secondary, encrypted mobile messaging application, happening almost immediately.” Once the conversation has shifted to Signal or WhatsApp, the threat actors urge victims to provide an authentication code that allows the actors to sync their device with the victim’s contact list, share Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and copies of sensitive personal documents, wire funds to an overseas financial institution under false pretenses, and request them to introduce the actor to a known associate. Noyb Files Complaint Against TikTok, AppsFlyer and Grindr
— Austrian privacy non-profit noyb has
filed
complaints against TikTok, AppsFlyer, and Grindr, accusing the popular video sharing platform of unlawfully tracking users across apps in violation of GDPR laws in the region. “A user found out about this unlawful tracking practice through an access request – which showed that, e.g.</p>

<p>his usage of Grindr was sent to TikTok, likely via the Israeli tracking company AppsFlyer – which allows TikTok to draw conclusions about his sexual orientation and sex life,” noyb said. “TikTok initially even withheld this information from the user, which violates Article 15 GDPR. Only after repeated inquiries, TikTok revealed that it knows which apps he used, what he did within these apps (for example, adding a product to the shopping cart) - and that this data also included information about his usage of the gay dating app Grindr.”
AuraStealer Spotted in the Wild
— An emerging malware-as-a-service (MaaS) information stealer called AuraStealer has been distributed via Scam-Yourself campaigns, where victims are lured by TikTok videos disguised as product activation guides. “Viewers are instructed to manually retype and run a displayed command in an administrative PowerShell, which, however, instead of activating the software, quietly downloads and executes the malicious payload,” Gen Digital
said
.</p>

<p>“Apart from TikTok Scam-Yourself campaigns, AuraStealer is also distributed through supposedly cracked games or software, with delivery chains of varying complexity.” AuraStealer makes use of a long list of anti-analysis and obfuscation techniques, including indirect control flow obfuscation, string encryption, and exception-driven API hashing, to resist attempts to reverse engineer the malware. It’s capable of harvesting data from Chromium- and Gecko-based browsers, cryptocurrency wallets from desktop applications and browser extensions, clipboard contents, session tokens, credentials, VPNs, password managers, screenshots, and detailed system metadata. Also detected in the wild are two other information stealers named
Stealka
and
Phantom
, with the latter distributed via fake Adobe installers. Blind Eagle Continues to Attack Colombia
— Colombian institutions have continued to face attacks from a threat actor known as
Blind Eagle
.</p>

<p>The latest phishing attacks, targeting agencies under the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism (MCIT), have shifted to a more sophisticated, multi-layer flow that uses an off-the-shelf loader named
Caminho
to deliver DCRat. The messages are sent from compromised email accounts within the same organization to bypass security checks. “The phishing email used a legal-themed design to lure the recipient,” Zscaler
said
. “The email was created to appear as an official message from the Colombian judicial system, referencing a labor lawsuit with an authentic-sounding case number and date.</p>

<p>The email pressures the recipient to confirm receipt immediately, leveraging authority, fear of legal consequences, and confidentiality warnings to trick the recipient into taking an action, namely opening the attachment.”
Scripted Sparrow Linked to Large-Scale BEC Attacks
— A sprawling Business Email Compromise (BEC) collective known as Scripted Sparrow has been observed distributing more than three million email messages each month and refining its social-engineering playbook. “The scale of the group’s operation strongly suggests the use of automation to generate and send their attack messages,” Fortra
said
. “The group utilizes a combination of free webmail addresses as well as addresses on domains they’ve registered specifically for their operations. The group operates by posing as various executive coaching and leadership training consultancies.” First discovered in June 2024, the “loose collective of fraudsters” has members located in Nigeria, South Africa, Türkiye, Canada, and the U.S.</p>

<p>The group is estimated to have registered 119 domains and used 245 webmail addresses. It has also used 256 bank accounts to move money out of victims’ bank accounts. Smart Devices Run Outdated Browser Versions
— An
academic study
by a team of Belgian researchers has found that a majority of smart devices, such as smart TVs, e-readers, and gaming consoles, come with an embedded web browser that runs extremely outdated versions, sometimes as much as three years. All five e-readers that were tested, and 24 of 35 smart TV models, used embedded browsers that were at least three years behind current versions available to users of desktop computers.</p>

<p>These outdated, embedded browsers can leave users open to phishing and other security vulnerabilities. The authors said some of the issues lie in how development frameworks like Electron bundle browsers with other components. “We suspect that, for some products, this issue stems from the user-facing embedded browser being integrated with other UI components, making updates challenging – especially when bundled in frameworks like Electron, where updating the browser requires updating the entire framework,” they said in the paper. “This can break dependencies and increase development costs.”
Denmark Blames Russia For Attack on Water Utility
— The Danish Defence Intelligence Service (DDIS) has
blamed
Russia for recent destructive and disruptive cyber attacks against the country, including a water utility in 2024, as well as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on Danish websites in the run-up to the 2025 municipal and regional council elections.</p>

<p>The attacks have been attributed to pro-Russian hacktivist groups Z-Pentest and NoName057(16), respectively. “The Russian state uses both groups as instruments of its hybrid war against the West. The aim is to create insecurity in the targeted countries and to punish those who support Ukraine,” the DDIS said. “Russia’s cyber operations form part of a broader influence campaign intended to undermine Western support for Ukraine.” The statement comes a few days after a global cybersecurity advisory warned that pro-Russian hacktivist groups conduct opportunistic attacks against US and global critical infrastructure.</p>

<p>Russia Targeted by Arcane Werewolf
— Russian manufacturing companies have become the target of a threat actor known as
Arcane Werewolf
(aka Mythic Likho). Campaigns undertaken by the hacking group in October and November 2025 likely leveraged phishing emails as the initial access vector that presumably contained links to a malicious archive hosted on the attackers’ server. The links directed victims to a spoofed website imitating a Russian manufacturing company. The end goal of the attacks is to deploy a custom implant named Loki 2.1 by means of a loader that’s delivered using a Go-based dropper downloaded from an external server using PowerShell code embedded into a Windows shortcut (LNK) contained in the ZIP file.</p>

<p>In an attack chain detected in November 2025, a new C++ dropper was used to propagate the malware. Loki 2.1 is equipped to upload/download files, inject code into a target process, terminate arbitrary processes, retrieve environment variables, and stop its own execution. RansomHouse Upgrades to Complex Encryption
— The
RansomHouse
(aka Jolly Scorpius) ransomware group has upgraded its file encryption process to use two different encryption keys to encrypt files as part of their attacks in what has been described as a significant escalation and “concerning trajectory” in ransomware development. “The upgraded version’s code reveals a two-factor encryption scheme where the file is encrypted with both a primary key and a secondary key.</p>

<p>Data encryption is processed separately for each key,” Palo Alto Networks Unit 42
said
. “This significantly increases the difficulty of decrypting the data without both keys.” The e-crime group has been active since December 2021, listing 123 victims on its data leak site. Central to the threat actor’s operations is a tool called MrAgent that provides attackers with persistent access to a victim’s environment and simplifies managing compromised hosts at scale. It’s also responsible for deploying Mario to encrypt critical VM files in the ESXi hypervisor.</p>

<p>LLMs and Ransomware Lifecycle
— The emergence of large language models (LLMs) is likely accelerating the ransomware lifecycle, according to new findings from SentinelOne. “We observe measurable gains in speed, volume, and multilingual reach across reconnaissance, phishing, tooling assistance, data triage, and negotiation, but no step-change in novel tactics or techniques driven purely by AI at scale,” the company said. LLMs, including those that are deployed locally, can be used to replace the manual effort associated with drafting phishing emails and localized content, search for sensitive data, and develop malicious code. The continued sightings of various dark LLMs show that criminals are gravitating toward uncensored models that allow them to evade guardrails.</p>

<p>“Actors already chunk malicious code into benign prompts across multiple models or sessions, then assemble offline to dodge guardrails,” SentinelOne
said
. “This workflow will become commoditized as tutorials and tooling proliferate, ultimately maturing into ‘prompt smuggling as a service.’” The findings signal that the barrier to entry into cybercrime continues to drop, even as the ransomware ecosystem is splintering and the line between nation-state and crimeware activity is increasingly blurring. The use of the technology is also likely to
blur existing assessment lines
around tradecraft and attribution, owing to the fact that the capabilities even allow smaller groups to acquire capabilities that were once limited to advanced state-backed actors. TikTok Signs Agreement to Create New U.S.</p>

<p>Joint Venture
— Nearly a year after TikTok’s operations were
briefly banned
in the U.S. for national security concerns, the popular video-sharing platform said it has finalized a deal to move a substantial portion of its U.S. business under a new joint venture named TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC. According to reports from
Axios
,
Bloomberg
,
CNBC
, and
The Hollywood Reporter
, the company has signed agreements with the three managing investors: Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based MGX.</p>

<p>Together, those companies will own 45% of the U.S. operation, while ByteDance retains a nearly 20% share. The new entity is said to be responsible for protecting U.S. data, ensuring the security of its prized algorithm, content moderation, and “software assurance.” Oracle will be the trusted security partner in charge of auditing and validating compliance.</p>

<p>The agreement is set to go into effect on January 22, 2026. Under a national security law, China-based ByteDance was required to divest TikTok’s U.S. operations or face an effective ban in the country. The U.S.</p>

<p>government has since extended the ban four times as a deal was being hatched behind the scenes. Under President Donald Trump’s executive order in September, the attorney general was
blocked
from enforcing the national security law for a 120-day period in order to “permit the contemplated divestiture to be completed,” allowing the deal to finalize by January 23, 2026. Android Adware Campaign Targets East and Southeast Asia
— Android users in the Philippines, Pakistan, and Malaysia have been targeted by a large-scale Android adware campaign dubbed GhostAd that silently drains resources and disrupts normal phone use through persistent background activity. The set of 15 apps, distributed via Google Play, masqueraded as harmless utility and emoji-editing tools such as Vivid Clean and GenMoji Studio.</p>

<p>“Behind their cheerful icons, these apps created a persistent background advertising engine – one that kept running even after users closed or rebooted their devices, quietly consuming battery and mobile data,” Check Point
said
. “GhostAd integrates multiple legitimate advertising software development kits (SDKs), including Pangle, Vungle, MBridge, AppLovin, and BIGO, but uses them in a way that violates fair-use policies. Instead of waiting for user interaction, the apps continuously load, queue, and refresh ads in the background, using Kotlin coroutines to sustain the cycle.” The apps have since been removed by Google, but not before they amassed millions of downloads. Texas Sues TV Makers for Spying on Owners
— Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton accused Sony, Samsung, LG, Hisense, and TCL of spying on their customers and illegally collecting their data by using automatic content recognition (
ACR
), according to a new lawsuit.</p>

<p>“ACR in its simplest terms is an uninvited, invisible digital invader,” Paxton
said
. “This software can capture screenshots of a user’s television display every 500 milliseconds, monitor viewing activity in real time, and transmit that information back to the company without the user’s knowledge or consent. This conduct is invasive, deceptive, and unlawful.”
Cybercriminals Entice Insiders with High Payouts
— Check Point has called attention to dark web posts that aim to recruit insiders within organizations to gain access to corporate networks, user devices, and cloud environments. The activity targets the financial sector and cryptocurrency firms, as well as companies like Accenture, Genpact, Netflix, and Spotify.</p>

<p>The ads offer payouts from $3,000 to $15,000 for access or data. “Across darknet forums, employees are being approached, or even volunteering, to sell access or sensitive information for lucrative rewards,” the company
said
. When internal staff disable defenses, leak credentials, or provide privileged information, preventing an attack becomes exponentially harder. Monitoring the deep web and darknet for organizational mentions or stolen data is now as critical as deploying advanced cyber prevention technologies.”
Flaws in Anno 1404 Game
— Synacktiv researchers have
disclosed
multiple vulnerabilities in a strategy game named Anno 1404 that, if chained together, allow for arbitrary code execution from within the multiplayer mode.</p>

<p>JSCEAL Campaign Undergoes a Shift
— A Facebook ads campaign that’s used to distribute a compiled V8 JavaScript (JSC) malware called
JSCEAL
has evolved into a more sophisticated form, with the attackers adopting a revamped command-and-control (C2) infrastructure, enhanced anti-analysis safeguards, and an updated script engine designed for increased stealth. “In contrast to the 1H 2025 campaign, which relied primarily on .com domains, the August 2025 campaign includes a broader variety of top-level domains such as .org, .link, .net, and others,” Cato Networks
said
. “These domains are registered in bulk at regular intervals, suggesting an automated, scalable provisioning workflow.” What’s more, the updated infrastructure enforces stricter filtering and anti-analysis controls, blocking any HTTP request that does not present a PowerShell User-Agent. In the event a request includes the correct PowerShell User-Agent, the server responds with a fake PDF error rather than delivering the actual payload.</p>

<p>It’s only after the PDF has been returned that the C2 server delivers the next stage, including a modified version of the ZIP file containing the stealer malware. Third Defendant Pleads Guilty to Hacking Fantasy Sports and Betting Website
— Nathan Austad, 21, of Farmington, Minnesota, has
pleaded guilty
in connection with a scheme to hack thousands of user accounts at an unnamed fantasy sports and betting website and sell access to those accounts with the goal of stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from users. Austad and others launched a credential stuffing attack on the website in November 2022 and fully compromised approximately 60,000 user accounts. “In some instances, Austad and his co-conspirators were able to add a new payment method of their own on the account (i.e., to a newly added financial account belonging to the hacker) and then use it to withdraw all the existing funds in the victim account to themselves, thus stealing the funds in each affected Victim Account,” the U.S.</p>

<p>Justice Department said. “Using this method, Austad and others stole approximately $600,000 from approximately 1,600 victim accounts on the Betting Website.” Access to the victim accounts was then sold on various websites that traffic in stolen accounts. Drop in Critical CVEs in 2025
— The number of critical vulnerabilities flagged in 2025 is at 3,753, down from 4,629 in 2023 and 4,283 in 2024, even as the total number of CVEs has increased to more than 40,000. According to VulnCheck, about 25.9% of the 43,002 CVEs published in 2025 have been enriched with a CVSS v4 score.</p>

<p>“What this ultimately suggests is that CVSS v4 adoption is constrained not by lack of availability, but by limited participation from some of the largest and most influential CVE publishers and enrichers,” it
said
. “Commonly cited reasons include resource constraints, required tooling changes, and a perception that CVSS v4 provides limited additional value while increasing scoring complexity and operational overhead.”
Amadey Uses Self-Hosted GitLab Instance to Distribute StealC
— A new
Amadey
malware loader campaign has leveraged an exploited self-hosted GitLab instance (“gitlab.bzctoons[.]net”) to deliver the StealC infostealer. “This analysis reveals how threat actors are hijacking abandoned, self-hosted GitLab servers to create a legitimate-looking payload distribution infrastructure,” Trellix
said
. “The use of a long-standing domain with valid TLS certificates provides an effective evasion technique against traditional security controls.” While the domain appears to belong to a small-scale organization hosting GitLab with multiple users, evidence suggests that either the user account or the entire infrastructure has been compromised.</p>

<p>U.S. Dismantle E-Note Cryptocurrency Exchange
— U.S. authorities seized the servers and infrastructure of the E-Note cryptocurrency exchange (“e-note.com,” “e-note.ws,” and “jabb.mn”) for
allegedly laundering
more than $70 million from ransomware attacks and account takeover attacks since 2017. No arrests have been announced.</p>

<p>In tandem, authorities have also indicted the site’s operator, a 39-year-old Russian national named Mykhalio Petrovich Chudnovets, who is said to have started offering money laundering services to cybercriminals in 2010. Chudnovets has been charged with one count of conspiracy to launder monetary instruments, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. The takedown fits into a broader law enforcement effort aimed at taking down services that allow bad actors to abuse the financial system and cash out the ill-gotten proceeds. 🎥 Cybersecurity Webinars
How Zero Trust and AI Catch Attacks With No Files, No Binaries, and No Indicators
— Cyber threats are evolving faster than ever, exploiting trusted tools and fileless techniques that evade traditional defenses.</p>

<p>This webinar reveals how Zero Trust and AI-driven protection can uncover unseen attacks, secure developer environments, and redefine proactive cloud security—so you can stay ahead of attackers, not just react to them. Master Agentic AI Security: Learn to Detect, Audit, and Contain Rogue MCP Servers
— AI tools like Copilot and Claude Code help developers move fast, but they can also create big security risks if not managed carefully. Many teams don’t know which AI servers (MCPs) are running, who built them, or what access they have. Some have already been hacked, turning trusted tools into backdoors.</p>

<p>This webinar shows how to find hidden AI risks, stop shadow API key problems, and take control before your AI systems create a breach. 🔧 Cybersecurity Tools
Tracecat
— It is an open-source automation platform designed for security and IT teams that need flexible, scalable workflow orchestration. It combines simple YAML-based integration templates with a no-code interface for building workflows, along with built-in lookup tables and case management. Under the hood, workflows are orchestrated using Temporal to support reliability and scale, making Tracecat suitable for both local experimentation and production environments.</p>

<p>Metis
— It is an open-source, AI-powered security code review tool built by Arm’s Product Security Team. It uses large language models to understand code context and logic, helping engineers find subtle security issues that traditional tools often miss. Metis supports multiple languages through plugins, works with different LLM providers, and is designed to reduce review fatigue in large or complex codebases while improving secure coding practices. Disclaimer: These tools are for learning and research only.</p>

<p>They haven’t been fully tested for security. If used the wrong way, they could cause harm. Check the code first, test only in safe places, and follow all rules and laws. Conclusion
The past week made one point clear: the perimeter is gone, but accountability isn’t.</p>

<p>Every device, app, and cloud service now plays a part in defense. Patching fast, verifying what’s running, and questioning defaults are no longer maintenance tasks — they’re survival skills. As threats grow more adaptive, resilience comes from awareness and speed, not fear. Keep visibility high, treat every update as risk reduction, and remember that most breaches start with something ordinary left unchecked.</p>

<p>As the internet becomes an essential part of daily life, its environmental footprint continues to grow. Data centers, constant connectivity, and resource-heavy browsing habits all contribute to energy consumption and digital waste. While individual users may not see this impact directly, the collective effect of everyday browsing is significant. Choosing
a
browser designed with sustainability in mind
is one practical way to reduce that impact, without changing how you work online.</p>

<p>This article explains what eco-friendly browsing means, why it matters, and how a green browser like
Wave Browser
pairs a modern, secure browsing experience with a mission to help protect our ocean through verified cleanup efforts. Why Eco-Friendly Browsing Matters
Most people think of environmental impact in terms of transportation, food, or physical products. Digital activity is often overlooked. However:
Browsers run continuously throughout the day
Heavy tabs and background processes increase energy usage
Ads and trackers load unnecessary data
Inefficient browsing tools consume system resources
Over time, these factors contribute to higher energy demand across devices and infrastructure.</p>

<p>Eco-friendly browsing focuses on reducing unnecessary digital load while keeping the browsing experience efficient, functional, and user-friendly. What Makes a Browser “Green”? A
green or eco-conscious browser
isn’t defined by a single feature. Instead, it combines responsible design choices with transparency and measurable impact.</p>

<p>Key characteristics include:
Efficient use of system resources
Built-in tools that reduce excess data loading
Fewer unnecessary background processes
A clear commitment to environmental responsibility
Rather than asking users to change their habits, a
green browser
should fit naturally into everyday browsing. How Wave Browser Supports Eco-Friendly Browsing
Wave Browser
is designed for users who want a modern browsing experience while supporting environmental action. Its approach to eco browsing combines efficient technology with real-world impact with
AppEsteem-certified software standards
. Reducing Unnecessary Resource Usage
Wave Browser
includes built-in tools that help limit excess digital clutter.</p>

<p>Features like free ad blocking (available on Windows, Mac and Android), memory-saving tools, and integrated utilities reduce the need for multiple extensions and background processes. By cutting down on unnecessary data requests and system strain, Wave helps devices run more efficiently, using less energy over time. Using Built-In Tools Instead of Extra Extensions
Many users install multiple browser extensions to manage everyday tasks. Each extension can introduce additional scripts, permissions, and background activity.</p>

<p>Wave Browser
integrates common tools directly into the browser, such as:
A sidebar for quick access to tools and favorite sites
Built-in productivity features like split view and reading lists
Tools for saving and organizing online content directly within the browser
Keeping these tools built into the browser reduces the need for third-party add-ons developed outside the browser’s control, helping maintain a simpler and more predictable browsing environment. Browsing With Awareness, Not Disruption
Eco-friendly browsing shouldn’t feel restrictive. Wave is designed to feel familiar from the first launch, with clear browser settings and an intuitive interface. Users can:
Adjust privacy and browsing preferences
Choose their default search engine
Manage permissions for unfamiliar sites
Use Incognito Mode when needed
This balance allows users to browse comfortably while avoiding unnecessary digital noise.</p>

<p>Connecting Everyday Browsing to Real-World Impact
Wave Browser
goes beyond digital efficiency by linking browsing activity to verified environmental action. Through a
Certified Cleanup Partnership with
4ocean
, Wave helps fund the removal of plastic and trash from our ocean, rivers, and coastlines. Users support this effort simply by downloading and using the browser as part of their normal routine without special actions required. Cleanup efforts support:
Professional cleanup crews
Vessels and equipment
Cleanup materials and operations
Progress is tracked transparently through the browser homepage and through monthly impact reports shared by Wave, connecting everyday browsing to verified ocean cleanup efforts and a
long-term goal of removing 300,000 pounds of trash from our ocean, rivers, and coastlines by 2028
.</p>

<p>Eco Browsing Without Changing How You Work
One of the biggest barriers to sustainable technology is friction. If a product requires major behavior changes, adoption drops quickly. Wave Browser
is designed to avoid that problem. It works like a modern browser should—efficient, intuitive, and flexible—while supporting more responsible browsing behind the scenes.</p>

<p>Users don’t need to browse differently. They simply browse with more intention built into the tool they already use every day. Making More Sustainable Choices Online
Eco-friendly browsing isn’t about perfection
. It’s about small, practical decisions that scale when adopted by many users.</p>

<p>By choosing a browser that:
Uses resources efficiently
Reduces unnecessary digital load
Supports verified environmental action
Users can make a meaningful difference without sacrificing usability or performance. Wave Browser
shows how everyday technology can support both productivity and environmental responsibility, one browsing session at a time. Found this article interesting? This article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.</p>

<h2 id="android-malware-operations-merge-droppers-sms-theft-and-rat-capabilities-at-scale"><a id="article-11"></a>Android Malware Operations Merge Droppers, SMS Theft, and RAT Capabilities at Scale</h2>

<p>Threat actors have been observed leveraging malicious dropper apps masquerading as legitimate applications to deliver an Android SMS stealer dubbed
Wonderland
in mobile attacks targeting users in Uzbekistan. “Previously, users received ‘pure’ Trojan APKs that acted as malware immediately upon installation,” Group-IB
said
in an analysis published last week. “Now, adversaries increasingly deploy droppers disguised as legitimate applications. The dropper looks harmless on the surface but contains a built-in malicious payload, which is deployed locally after installation – even without an active internet connection.”
Wonderland (formerly WretchedCat), according to the Singapore-headquartered cybersecurity company, facilitates bidirectional command-and-control (C2) communication to execute commands in real-time, allowing for arbitrary USSD requests and SMS theft.</p>

<p>It masquerades as Google Play, or files of other formats, such as videos, photos, and wedding invitations. The financially motivated threat actor behind the malware, TrickyWonders, leverages Telegram as the primary platform to coordinate various aspects of the operation. First discovered in November 2023, it’s also attributed to two dropper malware families that are designed to conceal the primary encrypted payload -
MidnightDat (First seen on August 27, 2025)
RoundRift (First seen on October 15, 2025)
Wonderland is mainly propagated using fake Google Play Store web pages, ad campaigns on Facebook, bogus accounts on dating apps, and messaging apps like Telegram, with the attackers abusing stolen Telegram sessions of Uzbek users sold on dark web markets to distribute APK files to victims’ contacts and chats. Once the malware is installed, it gains access to SMS messages and intercepts one-time passwords (OTPs), which the group uses to siphon funds from victims’ bank cards.</p>

<p>Other capabilities include retrieving phone numbers, exfiltrating contact lists, hiding push notifications to suppress security or one-time password (OTP) alerts, and even sending SMS messages from infected devices for lateral movement. However, it’s worth pointing out that sideloading the app first requires users to enable a setting that allows installation from unknown sources. This is accomplished by displaying an update screen that instructs them to “install the update to use the app.”
“When a victim installs the APK and provides the permissions, the attackers hijack the phone number and attempt to log into the Telegram account registered with that phone number,” Group-IB said. “If the login succeeds, the distribution process is repeated, creating a cyclical infection chain.”
Wonderland represents the latest evolution of mobile malware in Uzbekistan, which has shifted from rudimentary malware such as
Ajina.Banker
that relied on large-scale spam campaigns to more obfuscated strains like
Qwizzserial
that were found disguised as seemingly benign media files.</p>

<p>The use of dropper applications is strategic as it causes them to appear harmless and evade security checks. In addition, both the dropper and SMS stealer components are heavily obfuscated and incorporate anti-analysis tricks to make them a lot more challenging and time-consuming to reverse engineer. What’s more, the use of bidirectional C2 communication transforms the malware from a passive SMS stealer to an active remote-controlled agent that can execute arbitrary USSD requests issued by the server. “The supporting infrastructure has also become more dynamic and resilient,” the researchers said.</p>

<p>“Operators rely on rapidly changing domains, each of which is used only for a limited set of builds before being replaced. This approach complicates monitoring, disrupts blacklist-based defenses, and increases the longevity of command and control channels.”
The malicious APK builds are generated using a dedicated Telegram bot, which is then distributed by a category of threat actors called workers in exchange for a share of the stolen funds. As part of this effort, each build is associated with its own C2 domains so that any takedown attempt does not bring down the entire attack infrastructure. The criminal enterprise also includes group owners, developers, and vbivers, who validate stolen card information.</p>

<p>This hierarchical structure reflects a new maturation of the financial fraud operation. “The new wave of malware development in the region clearly demonstrates that methods of compromising Android devices are not just becoming more sophisticated – they are evolving at a rapid pace,” Group-IB said. Attackers are actively adapting their tools, implementing new approaches to distribution, concealment of activity, and maintaining control over infected devices.”
The disclosure coincides with the emergence of new Android malware, such as
Cellik
,
Frogblight
, and
NexusRoute
, that are capable of harvesting sensitive information from compromised devices. Cellik, which is advertised on the dark web for a starting price of $150 for one month or for $900 for a lifetime licence, is equipped with real-time screen streaming, keylogging, remote camera/microphone access, data wiping, hidden web browsing, notification interception, and app overlays to steal credentials.</p>

<p>Perhaps the Trojan’s most troubling feature is a one-click APK builder that allows customers to bundle the malicious payload within legitimate Google Play apps for distribution. “Through its control interface, an attacker can browse the entire Google Play Store catalogue and select legitimate apps to bundle with the Cellik payload,” iVerify’s Daniel Kelley said. “With one click, Cellik will generate a new malicious APK that wraps the RAT inside the chosen legitimate app.”
Frogblight, on the other hand, has been found to target users in Turkey via SMS phishing messages that trick recipients into installing the malware under the pretext of viewing court documents related to a court case they are purported to be involved in, Kaspersky said. Besides stealing banking credentials using WebViews, the malware can collect SMS messages, call logs, a list of installed apps on the device, and device file system information.</p>

<p>It can also manage contacts and send arbitrary SMS messages. Frogblight is believed to be under active development, with the threat actor behind the tool laying the groundwork for it to be distributed under a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model. This assessment is based on the discovery of a web panel hosted on the C2 server and the fact that only samples using the same key as the web panel login can be remotely controlled through it. Malware families like Cellik and Frogblight are part of a growing trend of Android malware, wherein even attackers with little to no technical expertise can now run mobile campaigns at scale with minimal effort.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, Android users in India have also been targeted by a malware dubbed NexusRoute that employs phishing portals impersonating the Indian government services to redirect visitors to malicious APKs hosted on GitHub repositories and GitHub Pages, while simultaneously collecting their personal and financial information. The bogus sites are designed to infect Android devices with a fully obfuscated remote access trojan (RAT) that can steal mobile numbers, vehicle data, UPI PINs, OTPs, and card details, as well as harvest extensive data by abusing accessibility services and prompting users to set it as the default home screen launcher. “Threat actors increasingly weaponize government branding, payment workflows, and citizen service portals to deploy financially driven malware and phishing attacks under the guise of legitimacy,” CYFIRMA said. “The malware performs SMS interception, SIM profiling, contact theft, call-log harvesting, file access, screenshot capture, microphone activation, and GPS tracking.”
Further analysis of an embedded email address “gymkhana.studio@gmail[.]com” has linked NexusRoute to a broader underground development ecosystem, raising the possibility that it’s part of a professionally maintained, large-scale fraud and surveillance infrastructure.</p>

<p>“The NexusRoute campaign represents a highly mature, professionally engineered mobile cybercrime operation that combines phishing, malware, financial fraud, and surveillance into a unified attack framework,” the company said. “The use of native-level obfuscation, dynamic loaders, automated infrastructure, and centralized surveillance control places this campaign well beyond the capabilities of common scam actors.”

<h2 id="iranian-infy-apt-resurfaces-with-new-malware-activity-after-years-of-silence"><a id="article-12"></a>Iranian Infy APT Resurfaces with New Malware Activity After Years of Silence</h2>

<p>Threat hunters have discerned new activity associated with an Iranian threat actor known as
Infy
(aka Prince of Persia), nearly five years after the hacking group was
observed
targeting victims in Sweden, the Netherlands, and Turkey. “The scale of Prince of Persia’s activity is more significant than we originally anticipated,” Tomer Bar, vice president of security research at SafeBreach,
said
in a technical breakdown shared with The Hacker News. “This threat group is still active, relevant, and dangerous.”
Infy is one of the oldest advanced persistent threat (APT) actors in existence, with evidence of early activity dating all the way back to December 2004, according to a
report
released by Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 in May 2016 that was also authored by Bar, along with researcher Simon Conant. The group has also managed to remain elusive, attracting little attention, unlike other Iranian hacking crews such as
Charming Kitten
,
MuddyWater
, and
OilRig
.</p>

<p>Attacks mounted by the group have prominently leveraged two strains of malware: a downloader and victim profiler named Foudre that delivers a second-stage implant called Tonnerre to extract data from high-value machines. It’s assessed that Foudre is distributed via phishing emails. The latest findings from SafeBreach have uncovered a covert campaign that has targeted victims across Iran, Iraq, Turkey, India, and Canada, as well as Europe, using updated versions of Foudre (version 34) and Tonnerre (versions 12-18, 50). The latest version of Tonnerre was detected in September 2025.</p>

<p>The attack chains have also witnessed a shift from a macro-laced Microsoft Excel file to embedding an executable within such documents to install Foudre. Perhaps the most notable aspect of the threat actor’s modus operandi is the use of a domain generation algorithm (DGA) to make its command-and-control (C2) infrastructure more resilient. In addition, Foudre and Tonnerre artifacts are known to validate if the C2 domain is authentic by downloading an RSA signature file, which the malware then decrypts using a public key and compares with a locally-stored validation file. SafeBreach’s analysis of the C2 infrastructure has also uncovered a directory named “key” that’s used for C2 validation, along with other folders to store communication logs and the exfiltrated files.</p>

<p>“Every day, Foudre downloads a dedicated signature file encrypted with an RSA private key by the threat actor and then uses RSA verification with an embedded public key to verify that this domain is an approved domain,” Bar said. “The request’s format is: ‘https://<domain name="">/key/<domain name=""><yy><day of="" year="">.sig.'"
Also present in the C2 server is a "download" directory whose current purpose is unknown. It is suspected that it's used to download and upgrade to a new version. The latest version of Tonnerre, on the other hand, includes a mechanism to contact a Telegram group (named "سرافراز," meaning "proudly" in Persian) through the C2 server.</day></yy></domain></domain></p>

<p>The group has two members: a Telegram bot “
@ttestro1bot
“ that’s likely used to issue commands and collect data, and a user with the handle “
@ehsan8999100
.”
While the use of the messaging app for C2 is not uncommon, what’s notable is that the information about the Telegram group is stored in a file named “tga.adr” within a directory called “t” in the C2 server. It’s worth noting that the download of the “tga.adr” file can only be triggered for a specific list of victim GUIDs. Also discovered by the cybersecurity company are other older variants used in Foudre campaigns between 2017 and 2020 -
A version of Foudre camouflaged as Amaq News Finder to download and execute the malware
A new version of a trojan called MaxPinner that’s downloaded by Foudre version 24 DLL to spy on Telegram content
A variation of malware called Deep Freeze, similar to Amaq News Finder, is used to infect victims with Foudre
An unknown malware called Rugissement
“Despite the appearance of having gone dark in 2022, Prince of Persia threat actors have done quite the opposite,” SafeBreach said. “Our ongoing research campaign into this prolific and elusive group has highlighted critical details about their activities, C2 servers, and identified malware variants in the last three years.”
The disclosure comes as DomainTools’ continued analysis of
Charming Kitten leaks
has painted the picture of a hacking group that functions more like a government department, while running “espionage operations with clerical precision.” The threat actor has also been unmasked as behind the
Moses Staff
persona.</p>

<p>“APT 35, the same administrative machine that runs Tehran’s long-term credential-phishing operations, also ran the logistics that powered Moses Staff’s ransomware theatre,” the company
said
. “The supposed hacktivists and the government cyber-unit share not only tooling and targets but also the same accounts-payable system. The propaganda arm and the espionage arm are two products of a single workflow: different “projects” under the same internal ticketing regime.”

<h2 id="us-doj-charges-54-in-atm-jackpotting-scheme-using-ploutus-malware"><a id="article-13"></a>U.S. DOJ Charges 54 in ATM Jackpotting Scheme Using Ploutus Malware</h2>

<p>The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) this week
announced
the indictment of 54 individuals in connection with a multi-million dollar ATM jackpotting scheme. The large-scale conspiracy involved deploying malware named
Ploutus
to hack into automated teller machines (ATMs) across the U.S. and force them to dispense cash.</p>

<p>The indicted members are alleged to be part of Tren de Aragua (TdA, Spanish for “the train of Aragua”), a Venezuelan gang
designated
a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department. In July 2025, the U.S. government
announced
sanctions
against the group’s head, Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores (aka Niño Guerrero), and five other key members for their involvement in the “illicit drug trade, human smuggling and trafficking, extortion, sexual exploitation of women and children, and money laundering, among other criminal activities.”
The Justice Department said an indictment returned on December 9, 2025, has charged a group of 22 people for supposedly committing bank fraud, burglary, and money laundering.</p>

<p>Prosecutors also alleged that TdA has leveraged jackpotting schemes to siphon millions of dollars in the U.S. and transfer the ill-gotten proceeds among its members and associates. Another 32 individuals have been charged in a second, related indictment returned on October 21, 2025, accusing them of “one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit bank burglary and computer fraud, 18 counts of bank fraud, 18 counts of bank burglary, and 18 counts of damage to computers.”
If convicted, the defendants could face a maximum penalty of anywhere between 20 and 335 years in prison. “These defendants employed methodical surveillance and burglary techniques to install malware into ATM machines, and then steal and launder money from the machines, in part to fund terrorism and the other far-reaching criminal activities of TDA, a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R.</p>

<p>Galeotti of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. The jackpotting operation is said to have relied on the TdA recruiting an unspecified number of individuals to deploy the malware across the nation. These individuals would then conduct initial reconnaissance to assess external security measures installed at various ATMs and then attempt to open the ATM’s hood to check if they triggered any alarm or a law enforcement response. Following this step, the threat actors would install Ploutus by either replacing the hard drive with one that came preloaded with the malicious program or by connecting a removable thumb drive.</p>

<p>The malware is equipped to issue unauthorized commands associated with the Cash Dispensing Module of the ATM in order to force currency withdrawals. “The Ploutus malware was also designed to delete evidence of malware in an effort to conceal, create a false impression, mislead, or otherwise deceive employees of the banks and credit unions from learning about the deployment of the malware on the ATM,” the DoJ said. “Members of the conspiracy would then split the proceeds in predetermined portions.”
Ploutus was first detected in Mexico in 2013. In a 2014 report, Symantec
detailed
how Windows XP-based ATMs compromised by the malware could be exploited to allow cybercriminals to withdraw cash simply by sending an SMS command.</p>

<p>A subsequent analysis from FireEye (now part of Google Mandiant) in 2017 detailed its ability to control Diebold ATMs and run on various Windows versions. “Once deployed to an ATM, Ploutus-D makes it possible for a money mule to obtain thousands of dollars in minutes,” it
explained
at the time. “A money mule must have a master key to open the top portion of the ATM (or be able to pick it), a physical keyboard to connect to the machine, and an activation code (provided by the boss in charge of the operation) in order to dispense money from the ATM.”
According to the agency, a total of 1,529 jackpotting incidents have been recorded in the U.S. since 2021, with about $40.73 million lost to the international criminal network as of August 2025.</p>

<p>“Many millions of dollars were drained from ATM machines across the United States as a result of this conspiracy, and that money is alleged to have gone to Tren de Aragua leaders to fund their terrorist activities and purposes,” U.S. Attorney Lesley Woods said.

<h2 id="russia-linked-hackers-use-microsoft-365-device-code-phishing-for-account-takeovers"><a id="article-14"></a>Russia-Linked Hackers Use Microsoft 365 Device Code Phishing for Account Takeovers</h2>

<p>A suspected Russia-aligned group has been attributed to a phishing campaign that employs device code authentication workflows to steal victims’ Microsoft 365 credentials and conduct account takeover attacks. The activity, ongoing since September 2025, is being tracked by Proofpoint under the moniker
UNK_AcademicFlare
. The attacks involve using compromised email addresses belonging to government and military organizations to strike entities within government, think tanks, higher education, and transportation sectors in the U.S. and Europe.</p>

<p>“Typically, these compromised email addresses are used to conduct benign outreach and rapport building related to the targets’ area of expertise to ultimately arrange a fictitious meeting or interview,” the enterprise security company
said
. As part of these efforts, the adversary claims to share a link to a document that includes questions or topics for the email recipient to review before the meeting. The URL points to a Cloudflare Worker URL that mimics the compromised sender’s Microsoft OneDrive account and instructs the victim to copy the provided code and click “Next” to access the supposed document. However, doing so redirects the user to the legitimate Microsoft device code login URL, where, once the previously provided code is entered, it causes the service to generate an access token that can then be recovered by the three actors to take control of the victim account.</p>

<p>Device code phishing was
documented
in detail by both Microsoft and Volexity in February 2025, attributing the use of the attack method to Russia-aligned clusters such as Storm-2372, APT29, UTA0304, and UTA0307. Over the past couple of months,
Amazon Threat Intelligence
and
Volexity
have warned of continued attacks mounted by Russian threat actors that abuse the device code authentication flow. Proofpoint said UNK_AcademicFlare is likely a Russia-aligned threat actor given its targeting of Russia-focused specialists at multiple think tanks and Ukrainian government and energy sector organizations. Data from the company shows that multiple threat actors, both state-aligned and financially-motivated, have latched onto the phishing tactic to deceive users into giving them access to Microsoft 365 accounts.</p>

<p>This includes an e-crime group named TA2723 that has used salary-related lures in phishing emails to direct users to fake landing pages and trigger device code authorization. The October 2025 campaign is assessed to have been fueled by the ready availability of crimeware offerings like the Graphish phishing kit and red-team tools such as
SquarePhish
. “Similar to SquarePhish, the tool is designed to be user-friendly and does not require advanced technical expertise, lowering the barrier for entry and enabling even low-skilled threat actors to conduct sophisticated phishing campaigns,” Proofpoint said. “The ultimate objective is unauthorized access to sensitive personal or organizational data, which can be exploited for credential theft, account takeover, and further compromise.”
To counter the risk posed by device code phishing, the best option is to create a Conditional Access policy using the Authentication Flows condition to block device code flow for all users.</p>

<p>If that’s not feasible, it’s advised to use a policy that uses an allow-list approach to allow device code authentication for approved users, operating systems, or IP ranges. Found this article interesting? Follow us on
