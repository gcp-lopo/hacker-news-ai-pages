<h2 id="researchers-warn-of-sitecore-exploit-chain-linking-cache-poisoning-and-remote-code-execution"><a id="article-1"></a>Researchers Warn of Sitecore Exploit Chain Linking Cache Poisoning and Remote Code Execution</h2>

<p>Three new security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in the Sitecore Experience Platform that could be exploited to achieve information disclosure and remote code execution. The flaws,
per watchTowr Labs
, are listed below -
CVE-2025-53693</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML cache poisoning through unsafe reflections
CVE-2025-53691</li>
  <li>Remote code execution (RCE) through insecure deserialization
CVE-2025-53694</li>
  <li>Information Disclosure in ItemService API with a restricted anonymous user, leading to exposure of cache keys using a brute-force approach
Patches for the first two shortcomings were released by Sitecore in
June
and for the third in
July 2025
, with the company stating that ‚Äúsuccessful exploitation of the related vulnerabilities might lead to remote code execution and non-authorized access to information.‚Äù
The findings build on three more flaws in the same product that were
detailed
by watchTowr back in June -
CVE-2025-34509
(CVSS score: 8.2) - Use of hard-coded credentials
CVE-2025-34510
(CVSS score: 8.8) - Post-authenticated remote code execution via path traversal
CVE-2025-34511
(CVSS score: 8.8) - Post-authenticated remote code execution via Sitecore PowerShell Extension
watchTowr Labs researcher Piotr Bazydlo said the newly uncovered bugs could be fashioned into an exploit chain by bringing together the pre-auth HTML cache poisoning vulnerability with a post-authenticated remote code execution issue to compromise a fully-patched Sitecore Experience Platform instance. The entire sequence of events leading up to code execution is as follows: A threat actor could leverage the ItemService API, if exposed, to trivially enumerate HTML cache keys stored in the Sitecore cache and send HTTP cache poisoning requests to those keys. This could then be chained with CVE-2025-53691 to supply malicious HTML code that ultimately results in code execution by means of an unrestricted
BinaryFormatter
call.</li>
</ul>

<p>‚ÄúWe managed to abuse a very restricted reflection path to call a method that lets us poison any HTML cache key,‚Äù Bazydlo said. ‚ÄúThat single primitive opened the door to hijacking Sitecore Experience Platform pages - and from there, dropping arbitrary JavaScript to trigger a Post-Auth RCE vulnerability.‚Äù

<h2 id="amazon-disrupts-apt29-watering-hole-campaign-abusing-microsoft-device-code-authentication"><a id="article-3"></a>Amazon Disrupts APT29 Watering Hole Campaign Abusing Microsoft Device Code Authentication</h2>

<p>Amazon on Friday said it flagged and disrupted what it described as an opportunistic watering hole campaign orchestrated by the Russia-linked APT29 actors as part of their intelligence gathering efforts. The campaign used ‚Äúcompromised websites to redirect visitors to malicious infrastructure designed to trick users into authorizing attacker-controlled devices through Microsoft‚Äôs device code authentication flow,‚Äù Amazon‚Äôs Chief Information Security Officer CJ Moses
said
. APT29, also tracked as BlueBravo, Cloaked Ursa, CozyLarch, Cozy Bear, Earth Koshchei, ICECAP, Midnight Blizzard, and The Dukes, is the name assigned to a state-sponsored hacking group with ties to Russia‚Äôs Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). In recent months, the prolific threat actor has been
linked
to attacks leveraging malicious Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) configuration files to target Ukrainian entities and exfiltrate sensitive data.</p>

<p>Since the start of the year, the adversarial collective has been observed adopting various phishing methods, including
device code phishing
and
device join phishing
, to obtain unauthorized access to Microsoft 365 accounts. As recently as June 2025, Google
said
it observed a threat cluster with affiliations to APT29 weaponizing a Google account feature called application-specific passwords to gain access to victims‚Äô emails. The highly targeted campaign was attributed to UNC6293. The latest activity identified by Amazon‚Äôs threat intelligence team underscores the threat actor‚Äôs continued efforts to harvest credentials and gather intelligence of interest, while simultaneously sharpening their tradecraft.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis opportunistic approach illustrates APT29‚Äôs continued evolution in scaling their operations to cast a wider net in their intelligence collection efforts,‚Äù Moses said. The attacks involved APT29 compromising various legitimate websites and injecting JavaScript that redirected approximately 10% of visitors to actor-controlled domains, such as findcloudflare[.]com, that mimicked Cloudflare verification pages to give an illusion of legitimacy. In reality, the end goal of the campaign was to entice victims into entering a legitimate device code generated by the threat actor into a sign-in page, effectively granting them access to their Microsoft accounts and data. This technique was
detailed
by both Microsoft and Volexity back in February 2025.</p>

<p>The activity is also noteworthy for incorporating various evasion techniques, such as Base64 encoding to conceal malicious code, setting cookies to prevent repeated redirects of the same visitor, and shifting to new infrastructure when blocked. Amazon told The Hacker News that it doesn‚Äôt have additional information on how many websites were compromised as part of this effort, and how these sites were hacked in the first place. ‚ÄúDespite the actor‚Äôs attempts to migrate to new infrastructure, including a move off AWS to another cloud provider, our team continued tracking and disrupting their operations,‚Äù Moses said. ‚ÄúAfter our intervention, we observed the actor register additional domains such as cloudflare.redirectpartners[.]com, which again attempted to lure victims into Microsoft device code authentication workflows.‚Äù

<h2 id="abandoned-sogou-zhuyin-update-server-hijacked-weaponized-in-taiwan-espionage-campaign"><a id="article-4"></a>Abandoned Sogou Zhuyin Update Server Hijacked, Weaponized in Taiwan Espionage Campaign</h2>

<p>An abandoned update server associated with input method editor (IME) software Sogou Zhuyin was leveraged by threat actors as part of an espionage campaign to deliver several malware families, including C6DOOR and GTELAM, in attacks primarily targeting users across Eastern Asia. ‚ÄúAttackers employed sophisticated infection chains, such as hijacked software updates and fake cloud storage or login pages, to distribute malware and collect sensitive information,‚Äù Trend Micro researchers Nick Dai and Pierre Lee
said
in an exhaustive report. The campaign, identified in June 2025, has been codenamed
TAOTH
by the cybersecurity company. Targets of the activity mainly include dissidents, journalists, researchers, and technology/business leaders in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, and overseas Taiwanese communities.</p>

<p>Taiwan accounts for 49% of all targets, followed by Cambodia (11%) and the U.S. (7%). It‚Äôs said the attackers, in October 2024, took control of the lapsed domain name (‚Äúsogouzhuyin[.]com‚Äù) associated with Sogou Zhuyin, a legitimate IME service that stopped receiving updates in June 2019, to disseminate malicious payloads a month later. It‚Äôs estimated that several hundred victims were impacted.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe attacker took over the abandoned update server and, after registering it, used the domain to host malicious updates since October 2024,‚Äù the researchers said. ‚ÄúThrough this channel, multiple malware families have been deployed, including GTELAM, C6DOOR, DESFY, and TOSHIS.‚Äù
The deployed malware families serve different purposes, including remote access (RAT), information theft, and backdoor functionality. To evade detection, the threat actors also leveraged third-party cloud services to conceal their network activities across the attack chain. These malware strains enable remote access, information theft, and backdoor functionality, with the attackers also using legitimate cloud storage services like Google Drive as a data exfiltration point and to conceal the malicious network traffic.</p>

<p>The attack chain begins when unsuspecting users download the official installer for Sogou Zhuyin from the Internet, such as the
Traditional Chinese Wikipedia page entry
for Sogou Zhuyin, which, in March 2025, was modified to point users to the malicious domain dl[.]sogouzhuyin[.]com. While the installer is completely innocuous, the malicious activity kicks in when the automatic update process is triggered a couple of hours after installation, causing the updater binary, ‚ÄúZhuyinUp.exe,‚Äù to fetch an update configuration file from an embedded URL: ‚Äúsrv-pc.sogouzhuyin[.]com/v1/upgrade/version.‚Äù
It‚Äôs this update process that has been tampered with to DESFY, GTELAM, C6DOOR, and TOSHIS with the ultimate goal of profiling and gathering data from high-value targets -
TOSHIS
(First detected December 2024), a loader designed to fetch next-stage payloads (Cobalt Strike or Merlin agent for Mythic framework) from an external server. It‚Äôs also a variant of
Xiangoop
, which has been attributed to
Tropic Trooper
and has been used to
deliver
Cobalt Strike or a backdoor called EntryShell in the past. DESFY
(First detected May 2025), a spyware that collects file names from two locations: Desktop and Program Files
GTELAM
(First detected May 2025), another spyware that collects file names matching a specific set of extensions (PDF, DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PPT, and PPTX), and exfiltrates the details to Google Drive
C6DOOR
, a bespoke Go-based backdoor that uses HTTP and WebSocket protocols for command-and-control so as to receive instructions to gather system information, run arbitrary commands, perform file operations, upload/download files, capture screenshots, list running processes, enumerate directories, and inject shellcode into a targeted process
Further analysis of C6DOOR has uncovered the presence of embedded Simplified Chinese characters within the sample, suggesting that the threat actor behind the artifact may be proficient in Chinese.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt appears that the attacker was still in the reconnaissance phase, primarily seeking high-value targets,‚Äù Trend Micro said. ‚ÄúAs a result, no further post-exploitation activities were observed in the majority of victim systems. In one of the cases we analyzed, the attacker was inspecting the victim‚Äôs environment and establishing a tunnel using Visual Studio Code.‚Äù
Interestingly, there is evidence that TOSHIS was also distributed to targets using a phishing website, likely in connection with a spear-phishing campaign targeting Eastern Asia and, to a lesser extent, Norway and the U.S. The phishing attacks have also been observed adopting a two-pronged approach -
Serving fake login pages with lures related to free coupons or PDF readers that redirect and grant OAuth consent to attacker-controlled apps, or
Serving fake cloud storage pages that mimic Tencent Cloud StreamLink to download malicious ZIP archives containing TOSHIS
These phishing emails include a booby-trapped URL and a decoy document that tricks the recipient into interacting with the malicious content, ultimately activating a multi-stage attack sequence designed to drop TOSHIS using DLL side-loading or obtain unauthorized access and control over their Google or Microsoft mailboxes through an OAuth permission prompt.</p>

<p>Trend Micro said the TAOTH shares infrastructure and tooling overlap with
previously documented
threat activity by ITOCHU, painting the picture of a persistent threat actor with a focus on reconnaissance, espionage, and email abuse. To combat these threats, organizations are recommended to routinely audit their environments for any end-of-support software and promptly remove or replace such applications. Users are urged to review the permissions requested by cloud applications before granting access. ‚ÄúIn the Sogou Zhuyin operation, the threat actor maintained a low profile, conducting reconnaissance to identify valuable targets among victims,‚Äù the company said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúMeanwhile, in the ongoing spear-phishing operations, the attacker distributed malicious emails to the targets for further exploitation.‚Äù

<h2 id="can-your-security-stack-see-chatgpt-why-network-visibility-matters"><a id="article-5"></a>Can Your Security Stack See ChatGPT? Why Network Visibility Matters</h2>

<p>Generative AI platforms like ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, and Claude are increasingly common in organizations. While these solutions improve efficiency across tasks, they also present new data leak prevention for generative AI challenges. Sensitive information may be shared through chat prompts, files uploaded for AI-driven summarization, or browser plugins that bypass familiar security controls. Standard DLP products often fail to register these events.</p>

<p>Solutions such as
Fidelis Network
¬Æ Detection and Response (NDR) introduce network-based data loss prevention that brings AI activity under control. This allows teams to monitor, enforce policies, and audit GenAI use as part of a broader data loss prevention strategy. Why Data Loss Prevention Must Evolve for GenAI
Data loss prevention for generative AI requires shifting focus from endpoints and siloed channels to visibility across the entire traffic path. Unlike earlier tools that rely on scanning emails or storage shares, NDR technologies like
Fidelis
identify threats as they traverse the network, analyzing traffic patterns even if the content is encrypted.</p>

<p>The critical concern is not just who created the data, but when and how it leaves the organization‚Äôs control, whether through direct uploads, conversational queries, or integrated AI features in business systems. Monitoring Generative AI Usage Effectively
Organizations can use GenAI DLP solutions based on network detection across three complementary approaches:
URL-Based Indicators and Real-Time Alerts
Administrators can define indicators for specific GenAI platforms, for example, ChatGPT. These rules can be applied to multiple services and tailored to relevant departments or user groups. Monitoring can run across web, email, and other sensors.</p>

<p>Process:
When a user accesses a GenAI endpoint,
Fidelis NDR
generates an alert
If a DLP policy is triggered, the platform records a full packet capture for subsequent analysis
Web and mail sensors can automate actions, such as redirecting user traffic or isolating suspicious messages
Advantages:
Real-time notifications enable prompt security response
Supports comprehensive forensic analysis as needed
Integrates with incident response playbooks and SIEM or SOC tools
Considerations:
Maintaining up-to-date rules is necessary as AI endpoints and plugins change
High GenAI usage may require alert tuning to avoid overload
Metadata-Only Monitoring for Audit and Low-Noise Environments
Not every organization needs immediate alerts for all GenAI activity. Network-based data loss prevention policies often record activity as metadata, creating a searchable audit trail with minimal disruption. Alerts are suppressed, and all relevant session metadata is retained
Sessions log source and destination IP, protocol, ports, device, and timestamps
Security teams can review all GenAI interactions historically by host, group, or time frame
Benefits:
Reduces false positives and operational fatigue for SOC teams
Enables long-term trend analysis and audit or compliance reporting
Limits:
Important events may go unnoticed if not regularly reviewed
Session-level forensics and full packet capture are only available if a specific alert escalates
In practice, many organizations use this approach as a baseline, adding active monitoring only for higher-risk departments or activities. Detecting and Preventing Risky File Uploads
Uploading files to GenAI platforms introduces a higher risk, especially when handling PII, PHI, or proprietary data.</p>

<p>Fidelis NDR can monitor such uploads as they happen. Effective AI security and data protection means closely inspecting these movements. Process:
The system recognizes when files are being uploaded to GenAI endpoints
DLP policies automatically inspect file contents for sensitive information
When a rule matches, the full context of the session is captured, even without user login, and device attribution provides accountability
Advantages:
Detects and interrupts unauthorized data egress events
Enables post-incident review with full transactional context
Considerations:
Monitoring works only for uploads visible on managed network paths
Attribution is at the asset or device level unless user authentication is present
Weighing Your Options: What Works Best
Real-Time URL Alerts
Pros:
Enables rapid intervention and forensic investigation, supports incident triage and automated response
Cons:
May increase noise and workload in high-use environments, needs routine rule maintenance as endpoints evolve
Metadata-Only Mode
Pros:
Low operational overhead, strong for audits and post-event review, keeps security attention focused on true anomalies
Cons:
Not suited for immediate threats, investigation required post-factum
File Upload Monitoring
Pros:
Targets actual data exfiltration events, provides detailed records for compliance and forensics
Cons:
Asset-level mapping only when login is absent, blind to off-network or unmonitored channels
Building Comprehensive AI Data Protection
A comprehensive GenAI DLP solutions program involves:
Maintaining live lists of GenAI endpoints and updating monitoring rules regularly
Assigning monitoring mode, alerting, metadata, or both, by risk and business need
Collaborating with compliance and privacy leaders when defining content rules
Integrating network detection outputs with SOC automation and asset management systems
Educating users on policy compliance and visibility of GenAI usage
Organizations should periodically review policy logs and update their system to address new GenAI services, plugins, and emerging AI-driven business uses. Best Practices for Implementation
Successful deployment requires:
Clear platform inventory management and regular policy updates
Risk-based monitoring approaches tailored to organizational needs
Integration with existing SOC workflows and compliance frameworks
User education programs that promote responsible AI usage
Continuous monitoring and adaptation to evolving AI technologies
Key Takeaways
Modern
network-based data loss prevention
solutions, as illustrated by Fidelis NDR, help enterprises balance the adoption of generative AI with strong AI security and data protection.</p>

<p>By combining alert-based, metadata, and file-upload controls, organizations build a flexible monitoring environment where productivity and compliance coexist. Security teams retain the context and reach needed to handle new AI risks, while users continue to benefit from the value of GenAI technology. Found this article interesting?

<h2 id="click-studios-patches-passwordstate-authentication-bypass-vulnerability-in-emergency-access-page"><a id="article-6"></a>Click Studios Patches Passwordstate Authentication Bypass Vulnerability in Emergency Access Page</h2>

<p>Click Studios, the developer of enterprise-focused password management solution Passwordstate, said it has
released
security updates to address an authentication bypass vulnerability in its software. The
high-severity issue
, which is yet to be assigned a CVE identifier, has been addressed in Passwordstate 9.9 (Build 9972), released August 28, 2025. The Australian company said it
fixed
a ‚Äúpotential Authentication Bypass when using a carefully crafted URL against the core Passwordstate Products‚Äô Emergency Access page.‚Äù
Also included in the latest version are improved protections to safeguard against potential clickjacking attacks aimed at its browser extension, should users end up visiting compromised sites. The safeguards are likely in response to findings from security researcher Marek T√≥th, who, earlier this month, detailed a technique called Document Object Model (DOM)-based extension clickjacking that several password manager browser add-ons have been found vulnerable to.</p>

<p>‚ÄúA single click anywhere on an attacker-controlled website could allow attackers to steal users‚Äô data (credit card details, personal data, login credentials, including TOTP),‚Äù T√≥th
said
. ‚ÄúThe new technique is general and can be applied to other types of extensions.‚Äù
According to Click Studios, the credential manager is
used
by 29,000 customers and 370,000 security and IT professionals, spanning global enterprises, government agencies, financial institutions, and Fortune 500 companies. The disclosure comes over four years after the company
suffered
a supply chain breach that enabled attackers to hijack the software‚Äôs update mechanism in order to drop malware capable of harvesting sensitive information from compromised systems. Then in December 2022, Click Studios also
resolved
multiple security flaws in Passwordstate, including an authentication bypass for Passwordstate‚Äôs API (CVE-2022-3875, CVSS score: 9.1) that could have been exploited by an unauthenticated remote adversary to obtain a user‚Äôs plaintext passwords.</p>

<h2 id="freepbx-servers-targeted-by-zero-day-flaw-emergency-patch-now-available"><a id="article-7"></a>FreePBX Servers Targeted by Zero-Day Flaw, Emergency Patch Now Available</h2>

<p>The Sangoma FreePBX Security Team has issued an advisory warning about an actively exploited FreePBX zero-day vulnerability that impacts systems with an administrator control panel (ACP) exposed to the public internet. FreePBX
is an open-source private branch exchange (PBX) platform widely used by businesses, call centers, and service providers to manage voice communications. It‚Äôs built on top of
Asterisk
, an open-source communication server. The vulnerability, assigned the CVE identifier
CVE-2025-57819
, carries a CVSS score of 10.0, indicating maximum severity.</p>

<p>‚ÄúInsufficiently sanitized user-supplied data allows unauthenticated access to FreePBX Administrator, leading to arbitrary database manipulation and remote code execution,‚Äù the project maintainers
said
in an advisory. The issue impacts the following versions -
FreePBX 15 prior to 15.0.66
FreePBX 16 prior to 16.0.89, and
FreePBX 17 prior to 17.0.3
Sangoma said an unauthorized user began accessing multiple FreePBX version 16 and 17 systems connected to the internet starting on or before August 21, 2025, specifically those that have inadequate IP filtering or access control lists (ACLs), by taking advantage of a sanitization issue in the processing of user-supplied input to the commercial ‚Äúendpoint‚Äù module. The initial access obtained using this method was then combined with other steps to potentially gain root-level access on the target hosts, it added. In light of active exploitation, users are
advised
to upgrade to the latest supported versions of FreePBX and restrict public access to the administrator control panel.</p>

<p>Users are also advised to scan their environments for the following indicators of compromise (IoCs) -
File ‚Äú/etc/freepbx.conf‚Äù recently modified or missing
Presence of the file ‚Äú/var/www/html/.clean.sh‚Äù (this file should not exist on normal systems)

<h2 id="feds-seize-64m-veriftools-fake-id-marketplace-but-operators-relaunch-on-new-domain"><a id="article-8"></a>Feds Seize $6.4M VerifTools Fake-ID Marketplace, but Operators Relaunch on New Domain</h2>

<p>Authorities from the Netherlands and the United States have announced the dismantling of an illicit marketplace called VerifTools that peddled fraudulent identity documents to cybercriminals across the world. To that end, two marketplace domains (verif[.]tools and veriftools[.]net) and one blog have been taken down, redirecting site visitors to a splash page stating the action was undertaken by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) pursuant to a warrant issued by a United States District Court. The servers were seized in Amsterdam.</p>

<p>However, a Telegram message posted by operators on August 28, 2025, shows that they have already launched the service on the domain ‚Äúveriftools[.]com.‚Äù The domain was created on December 10, 2018, per
DomainTools
. It‚Äôs currently not known who the administrators of the platform are. ‚ÄúThe operators of VerifTools produced and sold counterfeit driver‚Äôs licenses, passports, and other identification documents that could be used to bypass identity verification systems and gain unauthorized access to online accounts,‚Äù the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ)
said
Thursday.</p>

<p>The DoJ said the FBI began investigating the service in 2022 after it discovered a criminal operation to leverage stolen identities to access cryptocurrency accounts. The probe revealed that the illegal platform was being used to generate counterfeit identification documents for all 50 states of the U.S., as well as other foreign countries, for as little as $9. An equivalent of approximately $6.4 million of illicit proceeds has been linked to the VerifTools marketplace, the FBI said. On the VerifTools website, the operators argue plausible deniability by stating that: ‚ÄúLegal usage of the service is your responsibility.</p>

<p>By using the service, you must be aware of the local, state, and federal laws in your jurisdiction and take sole responsibility for your actions.‚Äù
Following the takedown, a Reddit user by the name Powda_reaper
claimed
that the site owners messaged them saying ‚Äúthe website is currently down due to major issues‚Äù and that they were bringing the site back up by August 29, while reassuring them that ‚ÄúYour funds are safe.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe internet is not a refuge for criminals. If you build or sell tools that let offenders impersonate victims, you are part of the crime,‚Äù said Acting U.S. Attorney Ryan Ellison. ‚ÄúWe will use every lawful tool to disrupt your business, take the profit out of it, and bring you to justice.</p>

<p>No one operation is bigger than us together.‚Äù
The Dutch National Police, in a coordinated statement, described VerifTools as one of the largest providers of false identity documents. In addition to two physical servers, more than 21 virtual servers have been confiscated. The officials also noted that the website‚Äôs entire infrastructure on the servers has been secured and copied for subsequent analysis. In the Netherlands, forgery, false proof of identity, and deploying counterfeit payment instruments each carry a maximum prison sentence of six years.</p>

<p>‚ÄúMany companies and agencies use so-called Know Your Customer verification (KYC), which often requires only an image of an ID. By using VerifTools, that KYC control could be bypassed,‚Äù the Politie
said
. ‚ÄúCriminals gratefully use platforms such as VerifTools, because they can commit their fraud with the created documents, such as bank helpdesk fraud and phishing.‚Äù

<h2 id="google-warns-salesloft-oauth-breach-extends-beyond-salesforce-impacting-all-integrations"><a id="article-9"></a>Google Warns Salesloft OAuth Breach Extends Beyond Salesforce, Impacting All Integrations</h2>

<p>Google has revealed that the
recent wave of attacks
targeting Salesforce instances via Salesloft Drift is much broader in scope than previously thought, stating it impacts all integrations. ‚ÄúWe now advise all Salesloft Drift customers to treat any and all authentication tokens stored in or connected to the Drift platform as potentially compromised,‚Äù Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) and Mandiant
said
in an updated advisory. The tech giant said the attackers also used stolen OAuth tokens to access email from a small number of Google Workspace email accounts on August 9, 2025, after compromising the OAuth tokens for the ‚ÄúDrift Email‚Äù integration. It‚Äôs worth noting that this is not a compromise of Google Workspace or Alphabet itself.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe only accounts that were potentially accessed were those that had been specifically configured to integrate with Salesloft; the actor would not have been able to access any other accounts on a customer‚Äôs Workspace domain,‚Äù Google added. Following the discovery, Google said it notified impacted users, revoked the specific OAuth tokens granted to the Drift Email application, and disabled the integration functionality between Google Workspace and Salesloft Drift amid ongoing investigation into the incident. The company is also urging organizations using Salesloft Drift to review all third-party integrations connected to their Drift instance, revoke and rotate credentials for those applications, and investigate all connected systems for signs of unauthorized access. The broadening of the attack radius comes shortly after Google
exposed
what it described as a widespread and opportunistic data theft campaign that allowed the threat actors, an emerging activity cluster dubbed UNC6395, to leverage compromised OAuth tokens associated with Salesloft Drift to target Salesforce instances from August 8 to 18, 2025.</p>

<p>Salesloft has since
revealed
that Salesforce has temporarily disabled the Drift integration between Salesforce, Slack, and Pardot, only to
follow it up nearly three hours later
, saying Salesforce has ‚Äúelected to temporarily
disable all Salesloft integrations
with Salesforce.‚Äù
‚ÄúBased on the investigation to date, there is no evidence of malicious activity detected in the Salesloft integrations related to the Drift incident,‚Äù it noted. ‚ÄúAdditionally, at this time, there are no indications that the Salesloft integrations are compromised or at risk.‚Äù

<h2 id="tamperedchef-malware-disguised-as-fake-pdf-editors-steals-credentials-and-cookies"><a id="article-10"></a>TamperedChef Malware Disguised as Fake PDF Editors Steals Credentials and Cookies</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a cybercrime campaign that‚Äôs using malvertising tricks to direct victims to fraudulent sites to deliver a new information stealer called
TamperedChef
. ‚ÄúThe objective is to lure victims into downloading and installing a trojanized PDF editor, which includes an information-stealing malware dubbed TamperedChef,‚Äù Truesec researchers Mattias W√•hl√©n, Nicklas Keijser, and Oscar Lejerb√§ck Wolf
said
in a report published Wednesday. ‚ÄúThe malware is designed to harvest sensitive data, including credentials and web cookies.‚Äù
At the heart of the campaign is the use of several bogus sites to promote an installer for a free PDF editor called AppSuite PDF Editor that, once installed and launched, displays to the user a prompt to agree to the software‚Äôs terms of service and privacy policy. In the background, however, the setup program makes covert requests to an external server to drop the PDF editor program, while also setting up persistence on the host by making Windows Registry changes to ensure that the downloaded executable is automatically started after a reboot.</p>

<p>The registry key contains a ‚Äìcm arguments parameter to pass instructions to the binary. German cybersecurity company G DATA, which also analyzed the activity, said the various websites offering these PDF editors download the same setup installer, which then downloads the PDF editor program from the server once the user accepts the license agreement. ‚ÄúIt then executes the main application with no arguments, which is equivalent to starting the ‚Äìinstall routine,‚Äù security researchers Karsten Hahn and Louis Sorita
said
. ‚ÄúIt also creates an autorun entry that supplies the command line argument ‚Äìcm=‚Äìfullupdate for the next run of the malicious application.‚Äù
It‚Äôs assessed that the campaign kicked off on June 26, 2025, when many of the counterfeit sites were either registered or began advertising the PDF editing software through at least five different Google advertising campaigns.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAt first the PDF appears to have behaved mostly harmless, but the code included instructions to regularly check back for potential updates in a .js file that includes the ‚Äìcm arguments,‚Äù the researchers explained. ‚ÄúFrom August 21, 2025, machines that called back received instructions that activated the malicious capabilities, an information stealer, referred to as ‚ÄòTamperedchef.‚Äô‚Äù
Once initialised, the stealer gathers a list of installed security products and attempts to terminate web browsers so as to access sensitive data, such as credentials and cookies. Further analysis of the malware-laced application by G DATA has revealed that it acts as a backdoor, supporting a number of features -
‚Äìinstall, to create scheduled tasks named PDFEditorScheduledTask and PDFEditorUScheduledTask that run the application with ‚Äìcm=‚Äìpartialupdate and ‚Äìcm=‚Äìbackupupdate arguments, respectively, to trigger the ‚Äìcheck and ‚Äì-ping routines
‚Äìcleanup, which is called by the uninstaller to remove the backdoor files, unregister the machine from the server, and delete the two scheduled tasks
‚Äìping, to initiate communications with a command-and-control (C2) for actions to execute on the system, which, among others, allow additional malware downloads, data exfiltration, and Registry changes
‚Äìcheck, to contact the C2 server for configuration, read browser keys, alter browser settings, and execute arbitrary commands to query, exfiltrate, and manipulate data associated with Chromium, OneLaunch, and Wave browsers, including credentials, browser history, cookies, or setting custom search engines
‚Äìreboot, same as ‚Äìcheck along with capabilities to kill specific processes
‚ÄúThe length from the start of the [ad] campaign until the malicious update was also 56 days, which is close to the 60-day length of a typical Google advertising campaign, suggesting the threat actor let the ad campaign run its course, maximizing downloads, before activating the malicious features,‚Äù Truesec said. The disclosures coincide with an analysis from Expel that
detailed
a large ad campaign advertising PDF editors, with the ads directing users to websites offering downloads of tools like AppSuite, PDF OneStart, and PDF Editor.</p>

<p>In some cases, these PDF programs have been found to download other trojanized apps without users‚Äô consent or turn the hosts into residential proxies. ‚ÄúAppSuite PDF Editor is malicious,‚Äù G DATA said. ‚ÄúIt is a classic trojan horse with a backdoor that is currently massively downloaded.‚Äù

<h2 id="researchers-find-vs-code-flaw-allowing-attackers-to-republish-deleted-extensions-under-same-names"><a id="article-11"></a>Researchers Find VS Code Flaw Allowing Attackers to Republish Deleted Extensions Under Same Names</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a loophole in the Visual Studio Code Marketplace that allows threat actors to reuse names of previously removed extensions. Software supply chain security outfit ReversingLabs
said
it made the discovery after it identified a malicious extension named ‚ÄúahbanC.shiba‚Äù that functioned similarly to two other extensions ‚Äì ahban.shiba and ahban.cychelloworld ‚Äì that were
flagged
earlier this March. All three libraries are designed to act as a downloader to retrieve a PowerShell payload from an external server that encrypts files in a folder called ‚ÄútestShiba‚Äù on the victim‚Äôs Windows desktop and demands a Shiba Inu token by instructing the victim to deposit the assets to an unspecified wallet. These efforts suggest ongoing development attempts by the threat actor.</p>

<p>The company said it decided to dig deeper because of the fact that the name of the new extension (‚ÄúahbanC.shiba‚Äù) was virtually the same as one of the two others previously identified (‚Äúahban.shiba‚Äù). It‚Äôs worth noting that each extension has to have a unique ID that‚Äôs a combination of the publisher name and the name of the extension (i.e., <publisher>.<name>). In the case investigated by ReversingLabs, both extensions are differentiated only by the name of the publisher, while the actual name of the extension remains the same. However,
according
to Visual Studio Code documentation, the <name> field specified in the extension manifest "should be all lowercase with no spaces" and "must be unique to the Marketplace."
"So how did extensions ahban.shiba and ahbanC.shiba end up having the same name despite the official documentation's publishing rules?," asked security researcher Lucija Valentiƒá, who ultimately found that it is possible to do so once the extension is removed from the repository.</name></name></publisher></p>

<p>But this behavior doesn‚Äôt apply to scenarios where an author unpublishes an extension. It‚Äôs worth noting that the ability to reuse the name of deleted libraries also applies to the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository, as
demonstrated
by ReversingLabs in early 2023. At the time, it was found that deleting a package would make its project name ‚Äúavailable to any other PyPI user‚Äù as long as the distribution file names (a combination of the project name, version number, and distribution type) are different from those used in the now-removed distribution. However, PyPI carves out an exception where PyPI package names can be made unavailable if they were first used by malicious packages.</p>

<p>It appears that Visual Studio Code does not have a similar restriction to prevent the reuse of names of malicious extensions. The development, as
observed
in
leaked Black Basta chat logs
, shows how threat actors are looking at poisoning open-source registries with ransomware libraries that demand ransoms from unsuspecting victims who may install them. This makes it all the more crucial for organizations and developers to adopt secure development practices and proactively monitor these ecosystems for software supply chain threats. ‚ÄúThe discovery of this loophole exposes a new threat: that the name of any removed extension can be reused, and by anyone,‚Äù Valentiƒá said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat means that if some legitimate and very popular extension is removed, its name is up for grabs.‚Äù
The findings also follow the
identification
of eight malicious npm packages that have been found to deliver a Google Chrome browser information stealer targeting Windows systems that‚Äôs capable of transmitting passwords, credit cards, cryptocurrency wallet data, and user cookies to a railway[.]app URL or a Discord webhook as a fallback mechanism. The packages, published by users named ruer and npjun, are listed below -
toolkdvv (versions 1.1.0, 1.0.0)
react-sxt (version 2.4.1)
react-typex (version 0.1.0)
react-typexs (version 0.1.0)
react-sdk-solana (version 2.4.1)
react-native-control (version 2.4.1)
revshare-sdk-api (version 2.4.1)
revshare-sdk-apii (version 2.4.1)
What‚Äôs notable about these packages is the use of 70 layers of obfuscated code to unpack a Python payload that‚Äôs engineered to facilitate data theft and exfiltration. ‚ÄúOpen-source software repositories have become one of the main entry points for attackers as part of supply chain attacks, with growing waves using typosquatting and masquerading, pretending to be legitimate,‚Äù JFrog security researcher Guy Korolevski said. ‚ÄúThe impact of sophisticated multi-layer campaigns designed to evade traditional security and steal sensitive data highlights the importance of having visibility across the entire software supply chain with rigorous automated scanning and a single source of truth for all software components.‚Äù

<h2 id="salt-typhoon-exploits-flaws-in-edge-network-devices-to-breach-600-organizations-worldwide"><a id="article-12"></a>Salt Typhoon Exploits Flaws in Edge Network Devices to Breach 600 Organizations Worldwide</h2>

<p>The China-linked advanced persistent threat (APT) actor known as
Salt Typhoon
has continued its attacks targeting networks across the world, including organizations in the telecommunications, government, transportation, lodging, and military infrastructure sectors. ‚ÄúWhile these actors focus on large backbone routers of major telecommunications providers, as well as provider edge (PE) and customer edge (CE) routers, they also leverage compromised devices and trusted connections to pivot into other networks,‚Äù according to a
joint cybersecurity advisory
published Wednesday. ‚ÄúThese actors often modify routers to maintain persistent, long-term access to networks.‚Äù
The
bulletin
, courtesy of authorities from 13 countries, said the malicious activity has been linked to three Chinese entities, Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing Huanyu Tianqiong Information Technology Co., Ltd., and Sichuan Zhixin Ruijie Network Technology Co., Ltd. These companies, the agencies said, provide cyber-related products and services to China‚Äôs intelligence services, with the data stolen from the intrusions, specifically those against telecoms and Internet service providers (ISPs), providing Beijing with the ability to identify and track their targets‚Äô communications and movements globally.</p>

<p>The countries that have co-sealed the security advisory include Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Spain, the U.K., and the U.S. Brett Leatherman, head of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation‚Äôs Cyber Division,
said
the Salt Typhoon group has been active since at least 2019, engaging in a persistent espionage campaign aimed at ‚Äúbreaching global telecommunications privacy and security norms.‚Äù
In a standalone alert issued today, Dutch intelligence and security services MIVD and AIVD
said
while organizations in the country ‚Äúdid not receive the same degree of attention from the Salt Typhoon hackers as those in the U.S.,‚Äù the threat actors gained access to routers of smaller ISPs and hosting providers. However, there is no evidence the hackers penetrated these networks further.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSince at least 2021, this activity has targeted organisations in critical sectors including government, telecommunications, transportation, lodging, and military infrastructure globally, with a cluster of activity observed in the U.K.,‚Äù the National Cyber Security Centre
said
. According to
The Wall Street Journal
and
The Washington Post
, the hacking crew has expanded its targeting focus to other sectors and regions, attacking no less than 600 organizations, including 200 in the U.S., and 80 countries. Salt Typhoon, which
overlaps
with activity tracked as GhostEmperor, Operator Panda, RedMike, and UNC5807, has been observed obtaining initial access through the exploitation of
exposed network edge devices
from Cisco (
CVE-2018-0171
,
CVE-2023-20198
, and
CVE-2023-20273
), Ivanti (
CVE-2023-46805
and
CVE-2024-21887
), and Palo Alto Networks (
CVE-2024-3400
). However, the agencies pointed out these vulnerabilities are not ‚Äúexhaustive‚Äù and that the threat actors may also go after other devices such as Fortinet firewalls, Juniper firewalls, Microsoft Exchange, Nokia routers and switches, Sierra Wireless devices, and Sonicwall firewalls, among others for initial access.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe APT actors may target edge devices regardless of who owns a particular device,‚Äù the agencies noted. ‚ÄúDevices owned by entities that do not align with the actors‚Äô core targets of interest still present opportunities for use in attack pathways into targets of interest.‚Äù
The compromised devices are then leveraged to pivot into other networks, in some cases even
modifying the device‚Äôs configuration
and adding a generic routing encapsulation (GRE) tunnel for persistent access and data exfiltration. Persistent access to target networks is accomplished by altering Access Control Lists (ACLs) to add IP addresses under their control, opening standard and non-standard ports, and running commands in an on-box Linux container on supported Cisco networking devices to stage tools, process data locally, and move laterally within the environment. Also put to use by the attackers are authentication protocols like Terminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus (
TACACS+
) to enable lateral movement across network devices, while simultaneously conducting extensive discovery actions and capturing network traffic containing credentials via compromised routers to burrow deeper into the networks.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe APT actors collected PCAPs using native tooling on the compromised system, with the primary objective likely being to capture TACACS+ traffic over TCP port 49,‚Äù the agencies said. ‚ÄúTACACS+ traffic is used for authentication, often for administration of network equipment and including highly privileged network administrators‚Äô accounts and credentials, likely enabling the actors to compromise additional accounts and perform lateral movement.‚Äù
On top of that, Salt Typhoon has been observed enabling the sshd_operns service on Cisco IOS XR devices to create a local user and grant it sudo privileges to obtain root on the host OS after logging in via TCP/57722. Google-owned Mandiant, which was one of the many industry partners that contributed to the advisory, stated the threat actor‚Äôs familiarity with telecommunications systems offers them a unique advantage, giving them an upper hand when it comes to defense evasion. ‚ÄúAn ecosystem of contractors, academics, and other facilitators is at the heart of Chinese cyber espionage,‚Äù John Hultquist, Chief Analyst at Google Threat Intelligence Group, told The Hacker News.</p>

<p>Contractors are used to build tools and valuable exploits as well as carry out the dirty work of intrusion operations. They have been instrumental in the rapid evolution of these operations and growing them to an unprecedented scale.‚Äù
‚ÄúIn addition to targeting telecommunications, reported targeting of hospitality and transportation by this actor could be used to closely surveil individuals. Information from these sectors can be used to develop a full picture of who someone is talking to, where they are, and where they are going.‚Äù
(The story was updated after publication to make it clear that the threat actors are targeting and may target a broad range of edge network appliances.)
