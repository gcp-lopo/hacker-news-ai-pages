<h2 id="noisy-bear-targets-kazakhstan-energy-sector-with-barrelfire-phishing-campaign"><a id="article-1"></a>Noisy Bear Targets Kazakhstan Energy Sector With BarrelFire Phishing Campaign</h2>

<p>A threat actor possibly of Russian origin has been attributed to a new set of attacks targeting the energy sector in Kazakhstan. The activity, codenamed Operation BarrelFire, is tied to a new threat group tracked by Seqrite Labs as Noisy Bear. The threat actor has been active since at least April 2025. ‚ÄúThe campaign is targeted towards employees of KazMunaiGas or KMG where the threat entity delivered a fake document related to the KMG IT department, mimicking official internal communication and leveraging themes such as policy updates, internal certification procedures, and salary adjustments,‚Äù security researcher Subhajeet Singha
said
.</p>

<p>The infection chain begins with a phishing email containing a ZIP attachment, which includes a Windows shortcut (LNK) downloader, a decoy document related to KazMunaiGas, and a README.txt file with instructions written in both Russian and Kazakh to run a program named ‚ÄúKazMunayGaz_Viewer.‚Äù
The email, per the cybersecurity company, was sent from a compromised email address of an individual working in the finance department of KazMunaiGas and targeted other employees of the firm in May 2025. The LNK file payload is designed to drop additional payloads, including a malicious batch script that paves the way for a PowerShell loader dubbed DOWNSHELL. The attacks culminate with the deployment of a DLL-based implant, a 64-bit binary that can run shellcode to launch a reverse shell. Further analysis of the threat actor‚Äôs infrastructure has revealed that it‚Äôs hosted on the Russia-based bulletproof hosting (BPH) service provider
Aeza Group
, which was sanctioned by the U.S.</p>

<p>in July 2025 for enabling malicious activities. The development comes as HarfangLab linked a Belarus-aligned threat actor known as
Ghostwriter
(aka FrostyNeighbor or UNC1151) to campaigns targeting Ukraine and Poland since April 2025 with rogue ZIP and RAR archives that are aimed at collecting information about compromised systems and deploying implants for further exploitation. ‚ÄúThese archives contain XLS spreadsheets with a VBA macro that drops and loads a DLL,‚Äù the French cybersecurity company
said
. ‚ÄúThe latter is responsible for collecting information about the compromised system and retrieving next-stage malware from a command-and-control (C2) server.‚Äù
Subsequent iterations of the campaign have been found to write a Microsoft Cabinet (CAB) file along with the LNK shortcut to extract and run the DLL from the archive.</p>

<p>The DLL then proceeds to conduct initial reconnaissance before dropping the next-stage malware from the external server. The attacks targeting Poland, on the other hand, tweak the attack chain to use Slack as a beaconing mechanism and data exfiltration channel, downloading in return a second-stage payload that establishes contact with the domain pesthacks[.]icu. At least in one instance, the DLL dropped through the macro-laced Excel spreadsheet is used to load a Cobalt Strike Beacon to facilitate further post-exploitation activity. ‚ÄúThese minor changes suggest that UAC-0057 may be exploring alternatives, in a likely attempt to work around detection, but prioritizes the continuity or development of its operations over stealthiness and sophistication,‚Äù HarfangLab said.</p>

<p>Cyber Attacks Reported Against Russia
The findings come amid
OldGremlin‚Äôs
renewed extortion attacks on Russian companies in the first half of 2025, targeting as many as eight large domestic industrial enterprises using phishing email campaigns. The intrusions, per
Kaspersky
, involved the use of the bring your own vulnerable driver (BYOVD) technique to disable security solutions on victims‚Äô computers and the legitimate Node.js interpreter to execute malicious scripts. Phishing attacks aimed at Russia have also
delivered
a new information stealer called Phantom Stealer, which is based on an open-source stealer codenamed
Stealerium
, to collect a wide range of sensitive information using email baits related to adult content and payments. It also shares overlaps with another Stealerium offshoot known as
Warp Stealer
.</p>

<p>According to F6, Phantom Stealer also inherits Stealerium‚Äôs ‚ÄúPornDetector‚Äù module that captures webcam screenshots when users visit pornographic websites by keeping tabs on the active browser window and whether the title includes a configurable list of terms like porn, and sex, among others. ‚ÄúThis is likely later used for ‚Äòsextortion,‚Äô‚Äù Proofpoint
said
in its own analysis of the malware. ‚ÄúWhile this feature is not novel among cybercrime malware, it is not often observed.‚Äù
In recent months, Russian organizations have also been at the receiving end of attacks perpetrated by
hacking groups
tracked as
Cloud Atlas
,
PhantomCore
, and
Scaly Wolf
to harvest sensitive information and deliver additional payloads using malware families such as
VBShower
,
PhantomRAT
, and PhantomRShell. Another cluster of activity involves a new Android malware that masquerades as an antivirus tool created by Russia‚Äôs Federal Security Services agency (FSB) to single out representatives of Russian businesses.</p>

<p>The apps carry names like SECURITY_FSB, –§–°–ë (Russian for FSB), and GuardCB, the last of which is an attempt to pass off as the Central Bank of the Russian Federation. First discovered in January 2025, the malware exfiltrates data from messenger and browser apps, stream from the phone‚Äôs camera, and log keystrokes by seeking extensive permissions to access SMS messages, location, audio, camera. It also requests for running in the background, device administrator rights, and accessibility services. ‚ÄúThe app‚Äôs interface provides only one language ‚Äì Russian,‚Äù Doctor Web
said
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThus, the malware is entirely focused on Russian users. The backdoor also uses accessibility services to protect itself from being deleted if it receives the corresponding command from the threat actors.‚Äù

<h2 id="malicious-npm-packages-impersonate-flashbots-steal-ethereum-wallet-keys"><a id="article-2"></a>Malicious npm Packages Impersonate Flashbots, Steal Ethereum Wallet Keys</h2>

<p>A new set of four malicious packages have been discovered in the npm package registry with capabilities to steal cryptocurrency wallet credentials from Ethereum developers. ‚ÄúThe packages masquerade as legitimate cryptographic utilities and
Flashbots MEV
infrastructure while secretly exfiltrating private keys and mnemonic seeds to a Telegram bot controlled by the threat actor,‚Äù Socket researcher Kush Pandya
said
in an analysis. The packages were uploaded to npm by a user named ‚Äú
flashbotts
,‚Äù with the earliest library uploaded as far back as September 2023. The most recent upload took place on August 19, 2025.</p>

<p>The packages in question, all of which are still available for download as of writing, are listed below -
@flashbotts/ethers-provider-bundle
(52 Downloads)
flashbot-sdk-eth
(467 Downloads)
sdk-ethers
(90 Downloads)
gram-utilz
(83 Downloads)
The impersonation of
Flashbots
is not coincidental, given its role in
combating
the
adverse effects
of Maximal Extractable Value (
MEV
) on the Ethereum network, such as sandwich, liquidation, backrunning, front-running, and time-bandit attacks. The most dangerous of the identified libraries is ‚Äú@flashbotts/ethers-provider-bundle,‚Äù which uses its functional cover to conceal the malicious operations. Under the guise of offering full Flashbots API compatibility, the package incorporates stealthy functionality to exfiltrate environment variables over SMTP using Mailtrap. In addition, the npm package implements a transaction manipulation function to redirect all unsigned transactions to an attacker-controlled wallet address and log metadata from pre-signed transactions.</p>

<p>sdk-ethers, per Socket, is mostly benign but includes two functions to transmit mnemonic seed phrases to a Telegram bot that are only activated when they are invoked by unwitting developers in their own projects. The second package to impersonate Flashbots, flashbot-sdk-eth, is also designed to trigger the theft of private keys, while gram-utilz offers a modular mechanism for exfiltrating arbitrary data to the threat actor‚Äôs Telegram chat. With mnemonic seed phrases serving as the ‚Äúmaster key‚Äù to recover access to cryptocurrency wallets, theft of these sequences of words can allow threat actors to break into victims‚Äô wallets and gain complete control over their wallets. The presence of Vietnamese language comments in the source code suggest that the financially-motivated threat actor may be Vietnamese-speaking.</p>

<p>The findings indicate a deliberate effort on part of the attackers to weaponize the trust associated with the platform to conduct software supply chain attacks, not to mention obscure the malicious functionality amidst mostly harmless code to sidestep scrutiny. ‚ÄúBecause Flashbots is widely trusted by validators, searchers, and DeFi developers, any package that appears to be an official SDK has a high chance of being adopted by operators running trading bots or managing hot wallets,‚Äù Pandya pointed out. ‚ÄúA compromised private key in this environment can lead to immediate, irreversible theft of funds.‚Äù
‚ÄúBy exploiting developer trust in familiar package names and padding malicious code with legitimate utilities, these packages turn routine Web3 development into a direct pipeline to threat actor-controlled Telegram bots.‚Äù

<h2 id="cisa-orders-immediate-patch-of-critical-sitecore-vulnerability-under-active-exploitation"><a id="article-3"></a>CISA Orders Immediate Patch of Critical Sitecore Vulnerability Under Active Exploitation</h2>

<p>Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies are being advised to update their Sitecore instances by September 25, 2025, following the discovery of a
security flaw
that has come under active exploitation in the wild. The
vulnerability
, tracked as
CVE-2025-53690
, carries a CVSS score of 9.0 out of a maximum of 10.0, indicating critical severity. ‚ÄúSitecore Experience Manager (XM), Experience Platform (XP), Experience Commerce (XC), and Managed Cloud contain a deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability involving the use of default machine keys,‚Äù the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
said
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis flaw allows attackers to exploit exposed ASP.NET machine keys to achieve remote code execution.‚Äù
Google-owned Mandiant, which discovered the active ViewState deserialization attack, said the activity leveraged a sample machine key that had been exposed in Sitecore deployment guides from 2017 and earlier. The threat intelligence team did not link the activity to a known threat actor or group. ‚ÄúThe attacker‚Äôs deep understanding of the compromised product and the exploited vulnerability was evident in their progression from initial server compromise to privilege escalation,‚Äù researchers Rommel Joven, Josh Fleischer, Joseph Sciuto, Andi Slok, and Choon Kiat Ng
said
. The abuse of publicly disclosed ASP.NET machine keys was
first documented
by Microsoft in February 2025, with the tech giant observing limited exploitation activity dating back to December 2024, in which unknown threat actors leveraged the keys to deliver the Godzilla post-exploitation framework.</p>

<p>Two months later, a similar zero-day vulnerability in Gladinet‚Äôs CentreStack, tracked as CVE-2025-30406 (CVSS score: 9.0),
came under exploitation
. It stemmed from an improperly protected machineKey that could expose internet-accessible servers to remote code execution attacks. Then in May 2025, ConnectWise
disclosed
an improper authentication flaw impacting ScreenConnect (CVE-2025-3935, CVSS score: 8.1) that it said had been exploited in the wild by a nation-state threat actor to conduct ViewState code injection attacks targeting a small set of customers. As recently as July, the Initial Access Broker (IAB) known as Gold Melody was
attributed
to a campaign that exploits leaked ASP.NET machine keys to obtain unauthorized access to organizations and sell that access to other threat actors.</p>

<p>In the attack chain documented by Mandiant, CVE-2025-53690 is weaponized to achieve initial compromise of the internet-facing Sitecore instance, leading to the deployment of a combination of open-source and custom tools to facilitate reconnaissance, remote access, and Active Directory reconnaissance. The ViewState payload delivered using the sample machine key specified in publicly available deployment guides is a .NET assembly dubbed WEEPSTEEL, which is capable of gathering system, network, and user information, and exfiltrating the details back to the attacker. The malware borrows some of its functionality from an open-source Python tool named ExchangeCmdPy.py. With the access obtained, the attackers have been found to establish a foothold, escalate privileges, maintain persistence, conduct internal network reconnaissance, and move laterally across the network, ultimately leading to data theft.</p>

<p>Some of the tools used during these phases are listed below -
EarthWorm
for network tunneling using SOCKS
DWAgent
for persistent remote access and Active Directory reconnaissance to identify Domain Controllers within the target network
SharpHound
for Active Directory reconnaissance
GoTokenTheft
for listing unique user tokens active on the system, executing commands using the tokens of users, and listing all running processes and their associated user tokens
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) for lateral movement
The threat actors have also been observed creating local administrator accounts (asp$ and sawadmin) to dump SAM/SYSTEM hives in an attempt to obtain administrator credentials access and facilitate lateral movement via RDP. ‚ÄúWith administrator accounts compromised, the earlier created asp$ and sawadmin accounts were removed, signaling a shift to more stable and covert access methods,‚Äù Mandiant added. To counter the threat, organizations are recommended to rotate the ASP.NET machine keys, lock down configurations, and scan their environments for signs of compromise. ‚ÄúThe upshot of CVE-2025-53690 is that an enterprising threat actor somewhere has apparently been using a static ASP.NET machine key that was publicly disclosed in product docs to gain access to exposed Sitecore instances,‚Äù Caitlin Condon, VP of security research at VulnCheck, told The Hacker News.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe zero-day vulnerability arises from both the insecure configuration itself (i.e., use of the static machine key) and the public exposure ‚Äî and as we‚Äôve seen plenty of times before, threat actors definitely read documentation. Defenders who even slightly suspect they might be affected should rotate their machine keys immediately and ensure, wherever possible, that their Sitecore installations are not exposed to the public internet.‚Äù
Ryan Dewhurst, head of proactive threat intelligence at watchTowr, said the issue is the result of Sitecore customers copying and pasting example keys from official documentation, rather than generating unique, random ones. ‚ÄúAny deployment running with these known keys was left exposed to ViewState deserialization attacks, a straight path right to Remote Code Execution (RCE),‚Äù Dewhurst added. ‚ÄúSitecore has confirmed that new deployments now generate keys automatically and that all affected customers have been contacted.</p>

<p>The blast radius remains unknown, but this bug exhibits all the characteristics that typically define severe vulnerabilities. The wider impact has not yet surfaced, but it will.‚Äù

<h2 id="tag-150-develops-castlerat-in-python-and-c-expanding-castleloader-malware-operations"><a id="article-4"></a>TAG-150 Develops CastleRAT in Python and C, Expanding CastleLoader Malware Operations</h2>

<p>The threat actor behind the malware-as-a-service (MaaS) framework and loader called CastleLoader has also developed a remote access trojan known as
CastleRAT
. ‚ÄúAvailable in both Python and C variants, CastleRAT‚Äôs core functionality consists of collecting system information, downloading and executing additional payloads, and executing commands via CMD and PowerShell,‚Äù Recorded Future Insikt Group
said
. The cybersecurity company is tracking the threat actor behind the malware families as TAG-150. Believed to be active since at least March 2025, CastleLoader et al are seen as initial access vectors for a wide range of secondary payloads, including remote access trojans, information stealers, and even other loaders.</p>

<p>CastleLoader (aka CastleBot) was
first documented
by Swiss cybersecurity company PRODAFT in July 2025, as having been put to use in various campaigns distributing DeerStealer, RedLine, StealC, NetSupport RAT, SectopRAT, and Hijack Loader. A subsequent analysis from IBM X-Force last month
found
that the malware has also served as a conduit for MonsterV2 and WARMCOOKIE through SEO poisoning and GitHub repositories impersonating legitimate software. ‚ÄúInfections are most commonly initiated through Cloudflare-themed
‚ÄòClickFix‚Äô
phishing attacks or fraudulent GitHub repositories masquerading as legitimate applications,‚Äù Recorded Future said. ‚ÄúThe operators employ the ClickFix technique by leveraging domains that imitate software development libraries, online meeting platforms, browser update alerts, and document verification systems.‚Äù
Evidence indicates that TAG-150 has been working on CastleRAT since March 2025, with the threat actor leveraging a multi-tiered infrastructure comprising Tier 1 victim-facing command-and-control (C2) servers, as well as Tier 2 and Tier 3 servers that are mostly virtual private servers (VPSes), and Tier 4 backup servers.</p>

<p>CastleRAT, the newly discovered addition to TAG-150‚Äôs arsenal, can download next-stage payloads, enable remote shell capabilities, and even delete itself. It also uses Steam Community profiles as dead drop resolvers to point to the actual C2 servers (‚Äúprogramsbookss[.]com‚Äù). Notably, CastleRAT comes in two versions, one written in C and the other, programmed in Python, with the latter also called PyNightshade. It‚Äôs worth noting that eSentire is
tracking
the same malware under the name NightshadeC2.</p>

<p>The C variant of CastleRAT incorporates more functionality, allowing it to log keystrokes, capture screenshots, upload/download files, and function as a cryptocurrency clipper to substitute wallet addresses copied to the clipboard with an attacker-controlled one with the aim of redirecting transactions. ‚ÄúAs with the Python variant, the C variant queries the widely abused IP geolocation service ip-api[.]com to collect information based on the infected host‚Äôs public IP address,‚Äù Recorded Future said. ‚ÄúHowever, the scope of data has been expanded to include the city, ZIP code, and indicators of whether the IP is associated with a VPN, proxy, or TOR node.‚Äù
That said, recent iterations of the C variant of CastleRAT have removed querying of the city and ZIP code from ip-api[.]com, indicating active development. It remains to be seen if its Python counterpart will attain feature parity.</p>

<p>eSentire, in its own analysis of NightshadeC2, described it as a botnet that‚Äôs deployed by means of a .NET loader, which, in turn, makes use of techniques like
UAC Prompt Bombing
to sidestep security protections. The Canadian cybersecurity company said it also identified variants equipped with features to extract passwords and cookies from Chromium- and Gecko-based web browsers. In a nutshell, the process involves running a PowerShell command in a loop that attempts to add an exclusion in Windows Defender for the final payload (i.e., NightshadeC2), after which the loader verifies the exit code of the PowerShell process to ascertain if it‚Äôs 0 (meaning success). If the exclusion is successfully added, the loader proceeds to deliver the malware.</p>

<p>If any other exit code other than 0 is returned, the loop keeps executing repeatedly, forcing the user to approve the User Account Control (UAC) prompt. ‚ÄúA particularly notable aspect of this approach is that systems with the WinDefend (Windows Defender) service disabled will generate non-zero exit codes, causing malware analysis sandboxes to become trapped in the execution loop,‚Äù eSentire said, adding the method enables a bypass of multiple sandbox solutions. Given the absence of any dark web advertisements related to TAG-150, it‚Äôs currently not clear how the services are distributed to other actors. But it‚Äôs possible that they are being promoted within a trusted circle of affiliates.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the emergence of CastleRAT is a sign that the operators may be looking to build an end-to-end toolset, allowing them to not only charge more for a subscription, but also fine-tune their operations at a faster pace. The development comes as Hunt.io detailed another malware loader codenamed TinyLoader that has been used to serve Redline Stealer and DCRat. Besides establishing persistence by modifying Windows Registry settings, the malware monitors the clipboard and instantly replaces copied crypto wallet addresses. Its C2 panels are hosted across Latvia, the U.K., and the Netherlands.</p>

<p>‚ÄúTinyLoader installs both Redline Stealer and cryptocurrency stealers to harvest credentials and hijack transactions,‚Äù the company
said
. ‚ÄúIt spreads through USB drives, network shares, and fake shortcuts that trick users into opening it.‚Äù
The findings also coincide with the discovery of two new malware families, a Windows-based keylogger called
TinkyWinkey
and a Python information stealer referred to as
Inf0s3c Stealer
, that can collect keyboard input and gather extensive system information, respectively. Further analysis of Inf0s3c Stealer has identified points of similarity with Blank Grabber and Umbral-Stealer, two other publicly available malware families, suggesting that the same author could be responsible for all three strains. ‚ÄúTinkyWinkey represents a highly capable and stealthy Windows-based keylogger that combines persistent service execution, low-level keyboard hooks, and comprehensive system profiling to gather sensitive information,‚Äù CYFIRMA said.</p>

<p>Inf0s3c Stealer ‚Äúsystematically collects system details, including host identifiers, CPU information, and network configuration, and captures screenshots. It enumerates running processes and generates hierarchical views of user directories, such as Desktop, Documents, Pictures, and Downloads.‚Äù

<h2 id="sap-s4hana-critical-vulnerability-cve-2025-42957-exploited-in-the-wild"><a id="article-5"></a>SAP S/4HANA Critical Vulnerability CVE-2025-42957 Exploited in the Wild</h2>

<p>A critical security vulnerability impacting SAP S/4HANA, an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software, has come under active exploitation in the wild. The command injection vulnerability, tracked as
CVE-2025-42957
(CVSS score: 9.9), was fixed by SAP as part of its monthly updates last month. ‚ÄúSAP S/4HANA allows an attacker with user privileges to exploit a vulnerability in the function module exposed via RFC,‚Äù according to a description of the flaw in the NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD). ‚ÄúThis flaw enables the injection of arbitrary ABAP code into the system, bypassing essential authorization checks.</p>

<p>Successful exploration of the defect could result in a full system compromise of the SAP environment, subverting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system. In short, it can permit attackers to modify the SAP database, create superuser accounts with SAP_ALL privileges, download password hashes, and alter business processes. SecurityBridge Threat Research Labs, in an
alert
issued Thursday, said it has observed active exploitation of the flaw, stating the issue impacts both on-premise and Private Cloud editions. ‚ÄúExploitation requires access only to a low-privileged user to fully compromise an SAP system,‚Äù the company said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúA complete system compromise with minimal effort required, where successful exploitation can easily lead to fraud, data theft, espionage, or the installation of ransomware.‚Äù
It also noted that while widespread exploitation has not yet been detected, threat actors possess the knowledge to use it, and that reverse engineering the patch to create an exploit is ‚Äúrelatively easy.‚Äù
As a result, organizations are advised to apply the patches as soon as possible, monitor logs for suspicious RFC calls or new admin users, and ensure appropriate segmentation and backups are in place. ‚ÄúConsider implementing SAP UCON to restrict RFC usage and review and restrict access to authorization object S_DMIS activity 02,‚Äù it also said. Update
Cybersecurity vendor Pathlock has also
revealed
it ‚Äúdetected outlier activity consistent with exploitation attempts of CVE-2025-42957,‚Äù warning ‚Äúany organization that has not yet applied SAP‚Äôs August 2025 security notes is at risk.‚Äù

<h2 id="automation-is-redefining-pentest-delivery"><a id="article-6"></a>Automation Is Redefining Pentest Delivery</h2>

<p>Pentesting remains one of the most effective ways to identify real-world security weaknesses before adversaries do. But as the threat landscape has evolved, the way we deliver pentest results hasn‚Äôt kept pace. Most organizations still rely on traditional reporting methods‚Äîstatic PDFs, emailed documents, and spreadsheet-based tracking. The problem?</p>

<p>These outdated workflows introduce delays, create inefficiencies, and undermine the value of the work. Security teams need faster insights, tighter handoffs, and clearer paths to remediation. That‚Äôs where automated delivery comes in. Platforms like
PlexTrac
automate pentest finding delivery in real time through robust, rules-based workflows.</p>

<p>(No waiting for the final report!)
The Static Delivery Problem in a Dynamic World
Delivering a pentest report solely as a static document might have made sense a decade ago, but today it‚Äôs a bottleneck. Findings are buried in long documents that don‚Äôt align with how teams operate day-to-day. After receiving the report, stakeholders must manually extract findings, create tickets in platforms like Jira or ServiceNow, and coordinate remediation tracking through disconnected workflows. By the time remediation begins, days or weeks may have passed since the issues were discovered.</p>

<p>Why Automation Matters Now
As organizations adopt Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) and expand the frequency of offensive testing, the volume of findings rapidly grows. Without automation, teams struggle to keep up. Automating delivery helps cut through the noise and deliver results in real time for faster handoffs and visibility across the entire vulnerability lifecycle. Benefits of automating pentest delivery include:
Real-time actionability:
Act on findings immediately, not after the report is finalized
Faster response:
Accelerate remediation, retesting and validation
Standardized operations:
Ensure every finding follows a consistent process
Less manual work:
Free teams to focus on strategic initiatives
Improved focus:
Keep teams focused on what matters
Service providers gain a competitive advantage by automating delivery and integrating directly into client workflows, making themselves an indispensable partner to drive client value.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>For enterprises, it‚Äôs a fast track to operational maturity and a measurable reduction in mean time to remediation (MTTR). 5 Key Components of Automated Pentest Delivery</dt>
  <dt>Centralized data ingestion</dt>
  <dd>Start by consolidating all findings‚Äîmanual and automated‚Äîinto a single source of truth. This includes outputs from scanners (like Tenable, Qualys, Wiz, Snyk) as well as manual pentest findings. Without centralization, vulnerability management becomes a patchwork of disconnected tools and manual processes.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Automated real-time delivery:
As findings are identified, they should be automatically routed to the right people and workflows without waiting for the full report. Predefined rulesets should trigger triage, ticketing, and tracking to allow remediation to begin while testing is still in progress. Automated routing &amp; ticketing:
Standardize routing by defining rules based on severity, asset ownership, and exploitability. Automation can assign findings, generate tickets in tools like Jira or ServiceNow, notify stakeholders through Slack or email, and close out informational issues to ensure findings are automatically routed to the right teams and systems.</p>

<p>Standardized remediation workflows:
Every finding from your centralized data should follow the same lifecycle from triage to closure based on the criteria you‚Äôve set, regardless of source. Whether it‚Äôs discovered from a scanner or manual testing, the process from triage to fix should be consistent and traceable. Triggered retesting &amp; validation:
When a finding is marked as resolved, automation should trigger the appropriate retesting or validation workflow. This ensures nothing slips through the cracks and keeps communication between security and IT teams coordinated and closed-loop.</p>

<p>PlexTrac supports each of these capabilities through its Workflow Automation Engine, helping teams unify and accelerate delivery, remediation, and closure in one platform. Avoid Common Pitfalls
Automation is about more than just speed. It‚Äôs about building standardized, scalable systems. However, if not implemented thoughtfully, it can create new problems.</p>

  <dt>Measure impact</dt>
  <dd>Track metrics like MTTR, handoff delays, and retest completion to show the value of your efforts. The Future of Pentest Delivery
Security teams are shifting from reactive testing to proactive exposure management. Pentest delivery automation is a key part of that evolution to help teams move faster, collaborate better, and reduce risk more effectively. For Service Providers, this is a chance to differentiate services, scale operations, and deliver more value with less overhead.</dd>
</dl>

<p>For Enterprise teams, it means driving maturity, demonstrating progress, and staying ahead of emerging threats. Conclusion
Pentesting is too important to be stuck in static reports and manual workflows. By automating delivery, routing, and remediation tracking, organizations can unlock the full value of their offensive security efforts by making findings more actionable, standardizing remediation workflows, and delivering measurable outcomes. Whether you‚Äôre delivering tests to clients or to an internal team, the message is clear: The future of pentest delivery is automated.</p>

<h2 id="virustotal-finds-44-undetected-svg-files-used-to-deploy-base64-encoded-phishing-pages"><a id="article-7"></a>VirusTotal Finds 44 Undetected SVG Files Used to Deploy Base64-Encoded Phishing Pages</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have flagged a new malware campaign that has leveraged Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files as part of phishing attacks impersonating the Colombian judicial system. The SVG files, according to
VirusTotal
, are distributed via email and designed to execute an embedded JavaScript payload, which then decodes and injects a Base64-encoded HTML phishing page masquerading as a portal for Fiscal√≠a General de la Naci√≥n, the Office of the Attorney General of Colombia. The page then simulates an official government document download process with a fake progress bar, while it stealthily triggers the download of a ZIP archive in the background. The exact nature of the ZIP file was not disclosed.</p>

<p>The Google-owned malware scanning service said it found 44 unique SVG files, all of which have remained undetected by antivirus engines, owing to the use of techniques like obfuscation, polymorphism, and large amounts of junk code to evade static detection methods. In all, as many as 523 SVG files have been detected in the wild, with the earliest sample dating back to August 14, 2025. ‚ÄúLooking deeper, we saw that the earliest samples were larger, around 25 MB, and the size decreased over time, suggesting the attackers were evolving their payloads,‚Äù VirusTotal said. The disclosure comes as cracked versions of legitimate software and ClickFix-style tactics are being used to lure users into infecting their Apple macOS systems with an information stealer called Atomic macOS Stealer (
AMOS
), exposing businesses to credential stuffing, financial theft, and other follow-on attacks.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAMOS is designed for broad data theft, capable of stealing credentials, browser data, cryptocurrency wallets, Telegram chats, VPN profiles, keychain items, Apple Notes, and files from common folders,‚Äù Trend Micro
said
. ‚ÄúAMOS shows that macOS is no longer a peripheral target. As macOS devices gain ground in enterprise settings, they have become a more attractive and lucrative focus for attackers.‚Äù
The attack chain essentially involves targeting users looking for cracked software on sites like haxmac[.]cc, redirecting them to bogus download links that provide installation instructions designed to trick them into running malicious commands on the Terminal app, thus triggering the deployment of AMOS. It‚Äôs worth noting that Apple prevents the installation of .dmg files lacking proper notarization due to macOS‚Äôs Gatekeeper protections, which require the application packages to be signed by an identified developer and notarized by Apple.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWith the release of macOS Sequoia, attempts to install malicious or unsigned .dmg files, such as those used in AMOS campaigns, are blocked by default,‚Äù the company added. ‚ÄúWhile this doesn‚Äôt eliminate the risk entirely, especially for users who may bypass built-in protections, it raises the barrier for successful infections and forces attackers to adapt their delivery methods.‚Äù
This is why threat actors are increasingly banking on ClickFix, as it allows the stealer to be installed on the machine using Terminal by means of a curl command specified in the software download page. ‚ÄúWhile macOS Sequoia‚Äôs enhanced Gatekeeper protections successfully blocked traditional .dmg-based infections, threat actors quickly pivoted to terminal-based installation methods that proved more effective in bypassing security controls,‚Äù Trend Micro said. ‚ÄúThis shift highlights the importance of defense-in-depth strategies that don‚Äôt rely solely on built-in operating system protections.‚Äù
The development also follows the discovery of a ‚Äúsprawling cyber campaign‚Äù that‚Äôs targeting gamers on the lookout for cheats with
StealC
stealer and crypto theft malware, netting the threat actors more than $135,000.</p>

<p>Per
CyberArk
, the activity is notable for leveraging StealC‚Äôs loader capabilities to download additional payloads, in this case, a cryptocurrency stealer that can siphon digital assets from users on infected machines. Found this article interesting? Follow us on

<h2 id="russian-apt28-deploys-notdoor-outlook-backdoor-against-companies-in-nato-countries"><a id="article-8"></a>Russian APT28 Deploys ‚ÄúNotDoor‚Äù Outlook Backdoor Against Companies in NATO Countries</h2>

<p>The Russian state-sponsored hacking group tracked as
APT28
has been attributed to a new Microsoft Outlook backdoor called
NotDoor
in attacks targeting multiple companies from different sectors in NATO member countries. NotDoor ‚Äúis a VBA macro for Outlook designed to monitor incoming emails for a specific trigger word,‚Äù S2 Grupo‚Äôs LAB52 threat intelligence team
said
. ‚ÄúWhen such an email is detected, it enables an attacker to exfiltrate data, upload files, and execute commands on the victim‚Äôs computer.‚Äù
The artifact gets its name from the use of the word ‚ÄúNothing‚Äù within the source code, the Spanish cybersecurity company added. The activity highlights the abuse of Outlook as a stealthy communication, data exfiltration, and malware delivery channel.</p>

<p>The exact initial access vector used to deliver the malware is currently not known, but analysis shows that it‚Äôs deployed via Microsoft‚Äôs OneDrive executable (‚Äúonedrive.exe‚Äù) using a technique referred to as DLL side-loading. This leads to the execution of a malicious DLL (‚ÄúSSPICLI.dll‚Äù), which then installs the VBA backdoor and disables macro security protections. Specifically, it runs Base64-encoded PowerShell commands to perform a series of actions that involve beaconing to an attacker-controlled webhook[.]site, setting up persistence through Registry modifications, enabling macro execution, and turning off Outlook-related dialogue messages to evade detection. NotDoor is designed as an obfuscated Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) project for Outlook that makes use of the
Application.MAPILogonComplete
and
Application.NewMailEx
events to run the payload every time Outlook is started or a new email arrives.</p>

<p>It then proceeds to create a folder at the path %TEMP%\Temp if it does not exist, using it as a staging folder to store TXT files created during the course of the operation and exfiltrate them to a Proton Mail address. It also parses incoming messages for a trigger string, such as ‚ÄúDaily Report,‚Äù causing it to extract the embedded commands to be executed. The malware supports four different commands -
cmd, to execute commands and return the standard output as an email attachment
cmdno, to execute commands
dwn, to exfiltrate files from the victim‚Äôs computer by sending them as email attachments
upl, to drop files to the victim‚Äôs computer
‚ÄúFiles exfiltrated by the malware are saved in the folder,‚Äù LAB52 said. ‚ÄúThe file contents are encoded using the malware‚Äôs custom encryption, sent via email, and then deleted from the system.‚Äù
The disclosure comes as Beijing-based 360 Threat Intelligence Center detailed
Gamaredon
‚Äòs (aka APT-C-53) evolving tradecraft, highlighting its use of Telegram-owned Telegraph as a dead-drop resolver to point to command-and-control (C2) infrastructure.</p>

<p>The attacks are also notable for the abuse of Microsoft Dev Tunnels (devtunnels.ms), a service that allows developers to securely expose local web services to the internet for testing and debugging purposes, as C2 domains for added stealth. ‚ÄúThis technique provides twofold advantages: first, the original C2 server IP is completely masked by Microsoft‚Äôs relay nodes, blocking threat intelligence tracebacks based on IP reputation,‚Äù the cybersecurity company
said
. ‚ÄúSecond, by exploiting the service‚Äôs ability to reset domain names on a minute-by-minute basis, the attackers can rapidly rotate infrastructure nodes, leveraging the trusted credentials and traffic scale of mainstream cloud services to maintain a nearly zero-exposure continuous threat operation.‚Äù
Attack chains entail the use of bogus
Cloudflare Workers domains
to distribute a Visual Basic Script like
PteroLNK
, which can propagate the infection to other machines by copying itself to connected USB drives, as well as download additional payloads. ‚ÄúThis attack chain demonstrates a high level of specialized design, employing four layers of obfuscation (registry persistence, dynamic compilation, path masquerading, cloud service abuse) to carry out a fully covert operation from initial implantation to data exfiltration,‚Äù 360 Threat Intelligence Center said.</p>

<p>Update
Kroll, in a separate analysis published on September 5, 2025, said it observed the NotDoor malware in a cyber espionage campaign targeting an unnamed entity. The risk advisory firm‚Äôs threat intelligence team is tracking the cluster under the name KTA007 and the malware as GONEPOSTAL. ‚ÄúThe campaign is a good example of living-off-the-land, using common business tools and methods of communication for command and control,‚Äù researchers Marc Messer and Dave Truman
said
. ‚ÄúInterception of email communications and a platform for tool ingress over legitimate means enables a stealthy manner of access which could be difficult to detect.‚Äù

<h2 id="ghostredirector-hacks-65-windows-servers-using-rungan-backdoor-and-gamshen-iis-module"><a id="article-9"></a>GhostRedirector Hacks 65 Windows Servers Using Rungan Backdoor and Gamshen IIS Module</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have lifted the lid on a previously undocumented threat cluster dubbed
GhostRedirector
that has managed to compromise at least 65 Windows servers primarily located in Brazil, Thailand, and Vietnam. The attacks, per Slovak cybersecurity company ESET, led to the deployment of a passive C++ backdoor called Rungan and a native Internet Information Services (IIS) module codenamed Gamshen. The threat actor is believed to be active since at least August 2024. ‚ÄúWhile Rungan has the capability of executing commands on a compromised server, the purpose of Gamshen is to provide SEO fraud as-a-service, i.e., to manipulate search engine results, boosting the page ranking of a configured target website,‚Äù ESET researcher Fernando Tavella
said
in a report shared with The Hacker News.</p>

<p>‚ÄúEven though Gamshen only modifies the response when the request comes from Googlebot ‚Äì i.e., it does not serve malicious content or otherwise affect regular visitors of the websites ‚Äì participation in the SEO fraud scheme can hurt the compromised host website‚Äôs reputation by associating it with shady SEO techniques and the boosted websites.‚Äù
Some of the other targets of the hacking group include Peru, the U.S., Canada, Finland, India, the Netherlands, the Philippines, and Singapore. The activity is also said to be indiscriminate, with entities in the education, healthcare, insurance, transportation, technology, and retail sectors singled out. Initial access to target networks is accomplished by exploiting a vulnerability, likely an SQL injection flaw, after which PowerShell is used to deliver additional tools hosted on a staging server (‚Äú868id[.]com‚Äù). ‚ÄúThis conjecture is supported by our observation that most unauthorized PowerShell executions originated from the binary sqlserver.exe, which holds a stored procedure
xp_cmdshell
that can be used to execute commands on a machine,‚Äù ESET said.</p>

<p>Rungan is designed to await incoming requests from a URL matching a predefined pattern (i.e., ‚Äúhttps://+:80/v1.0/8888/sys.html‚Äù), and then proceeds to parse and execute the commands embedded in them. It supports four different commands -
mkuser, to create a user on the server with the username and password provided
listfolder, to collect information from a provided path (unfinished)
addurl, to register new URLs that the backdoor can listen on
cmd, to run a command on the server using pipes and the
CreateProcessA
API
Written in C/C++, Gamshen is an example of an
IIS malware
family called ‚Äú
Group 13
,‚Äù which can act both as a backdoor and conduct SEO fraud. It functions similar to IISerpent, another IIS-specific malware that was documented by ESET back in August 2021. IISerpent
, configured as a malicious extension for Microsoft‚Äôs web server software, allows it to intercept all HTTP requests made to the websites hosted by the compromised server, specifically those originating from search engine crawlers, and change the server‚Äôs HTTP responses with the goal of redirecting the search engines to a scam website of the attacker‚Äôs choosing.</p>

<p>That IIS extensions can covertly open persistent backdoors into servers was acknowledged by Microsoft back way back in July 2022,
stating
they are also ‚Äúharder to detect since they mostly reside in the same directories as legitimate modules used by target applications, and they follow the same code structure as clean modules.‚Äù
‚ÄúGhostRedirector attempts to manipulate the Google search ranking of a specific, third-party website by using manipulative, shady SEO techniques such as creating artificial backlinks from the legitimate, compromised website to the target website,‚Äù Tavella said. It‚Äôs currently not known where these backlinks redirect unsuspecting users to, but it‚Äôs believed that the SEO fraud scheme is being used to promote various gambling websites. Also dropped alongside Rungan and Gamshen are various other tools -
GoToHTTP to establish a remote connection that‚Äôs accessible from a web browser
BadPotato or EfsPotato for creating a privileged user in the Administrators group
Zunput to collect information about websites hosted on the IIS server and drop ASP, PHP, and JavaScript web shells
It‚Äôs assessed with medium confidence that GhostRedirector is a China-aligned threat actor based on the presence of hard-coded Chinese strings in the source code, a code-signing certificate issued to a Chinese company, Shenzhen Diyuan Technology Co., Ltd., to sign the privilege escalation artifacts, and the use of the password ‚Äúhuang‚Äù for one of the GhostRedirector-created users on the compromised server. That said, GhostRedirector is not the first China-linked threat actor to use malicious IIS modules for SEO fraud.</p>

<p>Over the past year, both Cisco Talos and Trend Micro have detailed a Chinese-speaking group known as
DragonRank
that has engaged in SEO manipulation via BadIIS malware. ‚ÄúGamshen abuses the credibility of the websites hosted on the compromised server to promote a third-party, gambling website ‚Äì potentially a paying client participating in an SEO fraud as-a-service scheme,‚Äù the company said. ‚ÄúGhostRedirector also demonstrates persistence and operational resilience by deploying multiple remote access tools on the compromised server, on top of creating rogue user accounts, all to maintain long-term access to the compromised infrastructure.‚Äù

<h2 id="cybercriminals-exploit-xs-grok-ai-to-bypass-ad-protections-and-spread-malware-to-millions"><a id="article-10"></a>Cybercriminals Exploit X‚Äôs Grok AI to Bypass Ad Protections and Spread Malware to Millions</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have flagged a new technique that cybercriminals have adopted to bypass social media platform X‚Äôs malvertising protections and propagate malicious links using its artificial intelligence (AI) assistant Grok. The findings were
highlighted
by Nati Tal, head of Guardio Labs, in a series of posts on X. The technique has been codenamed Grokking. The approach is designed to get around restrictions imposed by X in
Promoted Ads
that allow users to only include text, images, or videos, and subsequently amplify them to a broader audience, attracting hundreds of thousands of impressions through paid promotion.</p>

<p>To achieve this, malvertisers have been found to run video card-promoted posts with adult content as bait, with the spurious link hidden in the ‚ÄúFrom:‚Äù metadata field below the video player by taking advantage of the fact that it‚Äôs not scanned by the social media platform. It‚Äôs worth mentioning here that the ‚ÄúFrom:‚Äù field is typically used to indicate the original poster of the video, but has been repurposed by the scammers in this campaign to share a link instead. In the next step, the fraudsters tag Grok in replies to the post using a throwaway account, asking something similar to ‚Äúwhere is this video from?,‚Äù prompting the AI chatbot to visibly display the link in response. ‚ÄúAdding to that, it is now amplified in SEO and domain reputation - after all, it was echoed by Grok on a post with millions of impressions,‚Äù Tal said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúA malicious link that X explicitly prohibits in ads (and should have been blocked entirely!) suddenly appears in a post by the system-trusted Grok account, sitting under a viral promoted thread and spreading straight into millions of feeds and search results!‚Äù
Guardio said the links direct users to sketchy ad networks, sending them to malicious links that push
fake CAPTCHA scams
, information-stealing malware, and other suspicious content via direct link (aka
smartlink
) monetization. The domains are assessed to be part of the same Traffic Distribution System (TDS), which is often used by
malicious ad tech vendors
to route traffic to harmful or deceptive content. The cybersecurity company told The Hacker News it has found hundreds of accounts engaging in this behavior over the past few days, with each of them posting hundreds or even thousands of similar posts. ‚ÄúThey seem to be posting non-stop for several days until the account gets suspended for violating platform policies,‚Äù it added.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSo there are definitely many of them and it looks very organized.‚Äù

<h2 id="simple-steps-for-attack-surface-reduction"><a id="article-11"></a>Simple Steps for Attack Surface Reduction</h2>

<p>Story teaser text: Cybersecurity leaders face mounting pressure to stop attacks before they start, and the best defense may come down to the settings you choose on day one. In this piece, Yuriy Tsibere explores how default policies like deny-by-default, MFA enforcement, and application Ringfencing ‚Ñ¢ can eliminate entire categories of risk. From disabling Office macros to blocking outbound server traffic, these simple but strategic moves create a hardened environment that attackers can‚Äôt easily penetrate. Whether you‚Äôre securing endpoints or overseeing policy rollouts, adopting a security-by-default mindset can reduce complexity, shrink your attack surface, and help you stay ahead of evolving threats.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity has changed dramatically since the days of the ‚ÄúLove Bug‚Äù virus in 2001. What was once an annoyance is now a profit-driven criminal enterprise worth billions. This shift demands proactive defense strategies that don‚Äôt just respond to threats‚Äîthey prevent them from ever reaching your network. CISOs, IT admins, and MSPs need solutions that block attacks by default
, not just detect them after the fact.</p>

<p>Industry frameworks like NIST, ISO, CIS, and HIPAA provide guidance, but they often lack the clear, actionable steps needed to implement effective security. For anyone starting a new security leadership role, the mission is clear: Stop as many attacks as possible, frustrate threat actors, and do it without alienating the IT team. That‚Äôs where a security-by-default mindset comes in‚Äîconfiguring systems to block risks out of the gate. As I‚Äôve often said, the attackers only have to be right once.</p>

<p>We have to be right 100% of the time. Here‚Äôs how setting the right defaults can eliminate entire categories of risk. Require multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all remote accounts
Enabling MFA across all remote services‚Äîincluding SaaS platforms like Office 365 and G Suite, as well as domain registrars and remote access tools‚Äîis a foundational security default. Even if a password is compromised, MFA can prevent unauthorized access.</p>

<p>Try to avoid using text messages for MFA as it can be intercepted. While it may introduce some friction, the security benefits far outweigh the risk of data theft or financial loss. Deny-by-default
One of the most effective security measures nowadays is application whitelisting or allowlisting. This approach blocks everything by default and only allows known, approved software to run.</p>

<p>The result: Ransomware and other malicious applications are stopped before they can execute. It also blocks legitimate-but-unauthorized remote tools like AnyDesk or similar, which attackers often try to sneak in through social engineering. Users can still access what they need via a pre-approved store of safe applications, and visibility tools make it easy to track everything that runs‚Äîincluding portable apps. Quick wins through secure configuration
Small changes to default settings can close major security gaps on Windows and other platforms:
Turn off Office macros: It takes five minutes and blocks one of the most common attack vectors for ransomware.</p>

<p>Use password-protected screensavers: Auto-lock your screen after a short break to stop anyone from snooping around. Disable SMBv1: This old-school protocol is outdated and has been used in big attacks like WannaCry. Most systems don‚Äôt need it anymore. Turn off the Windows keylogger: It‚Äôs rarely useful and could be a security risk if left on.</p>

<p>Control network and application behavior for organizations
Remove local admin rights: Most malware doesn‚Äôt need admin access to run, but taking it away stops users from messing with security settings or even installing malicious software. Block unused ports and limit outbound traffic:
Shut down SMB and RDP ports unless absolutely necessary‚Äîand only allow trusted sources. Stop servers from reaching the internet unless they need to. This helps avoid attacks like SolarWinds.</p>

<p>Control application behaviors: Tools like ThreatLocker Ringfencing ‚Ñ¢ can stop apps from doing sketchy things
‚Äîlike Word launching PowerShell (yes, that‚Äôs a real attack method). Secure your VPN: If you don‚Äôt need it, turn it off. If you do, limit access to specific IPs and restrict what users can access. Strengthen data and web controls
Block USB drives by default: They‚Äôre a common way for malware to spread.</p>

<p>Only allow secure managed, encrypted ones if needed. Limit file access: Apps shouldn‚Äôt be able to poke around in user files unless they really need to. Filter out unapproved tools: Block random SaaS or cloud apps that haven‚Äôt been vetted. Let users request access if they need something.</p>

<p>Track file activity: Keep an eye on who‚Äôs doing what with files‚Äîboth on devices and in the cloud. It‚Äôs key for spotting shady behavior. Go beyond defaults with monitoring and patching
Strong defaults are just the beginning. Ongoing vigilance is critical:
Regular patching: Most attacks use known bugs.</p>

<p>Keep everything updated‚Äîincluding portable apps. Automated threat detection: EDR tools are great, but if no one‚Äôs watching alerts 24/7, threats can slip through. MDR services can jump in fast, even after hours. Security by default isn‚Äôt just smart, it‚Äôs non-negotiable.</p>

<p>Blocking unknown apps, using strong authentication, locking down networks and app behavior can wipe out a ton of risk. Attackers only need one shot, but solid default settings keep your defenses ready all the time. The payoff? Fewer breaches, less hassle, and a stronger, more resilient setup.</p>

<h2 id="google-fined-379-million-by-french-regulator-for-cookie-consent-violations"><a id="article-12"></a>Google Fined $379 Million by French Regulator for Cookie Consent Violations</h2>

<p>The French data protection authority has
fined
Google and Chinese e-commerce giant Shein $379 million (‚Ç¨325 million) and $175 million (‚Ç¨150 million), respectively, for violating cookie rules. Both companies set advertising cookies on users‚Äô browsers without securing their consent, the National Commission on Informatics and Liberty (CNIL) said. Shein has since
updated
its systems to comply with the regulation. Reuters
reported
that the retailer plans to appeal the decision.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhen creating a Google account, users were encouraged to choose cookies linked to the display of personalized advertisements, to the detriment of those linked to the display of generic advertisements and that users were not clearly informed that the deposit of cookies for advertising purposes was a condition to be able to access Google‚Äôs services,‚Äù the CNIL
noted
. The consent obtained in this manner is not valid and constitutes a violation of the French Data Protection Act (Article 82), it added. It‚Äôs worth noting that while this was the default behavior until October 2023, when the company added an option to refuse cookies, ‚Äúthe lack of informed consent still persisted.‚Äù
Google has also been called out for placing advertisements in the form of emails among other emails in the ‚ÄúPromotions‚Äù and ‚ÄúSocial‚Äù tabs of Gmail, stating that the display of such ads required users‚Äô explicit consent in accordance with the French Postal and Electronic Communications Code (CPCE). French telecommunications operator Orange was
fined ‚Ç¨50 million
back in December 2024 for similarly displaying ads between actual email messages without users‚Äô consent.</p>

<p>Google has been ordered to bring its systems into compliance within six months, or risk facing penalties of ‚Ç¨100,000 per day. The development comes as a U.S. jury
found Google
to have violated users‚Äô privacy by collecting their data even after they opted out of Web &amp; App Activity tracking. The decision, which awards $425 million in compensatory damages, is the culmination of a class action lawsuit filed against the company in July 2020.</p>

<p>In a
statement
shared with Reuters, the tech giant said the ruling ‚Äúmisunderstands how [their] products work,‚Äù adding the company‚Äôs privacy tools give users control over their data and emphasized that their choice to turn off personalization are honored. It also said it plans to appeal. In related privacy-related announcements, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said Disney has
agreed
to pay $10 million to settle allegations that it collected personal data from children watching YouTube videos without parental notification or consent, thus violating the U.S.</p>

<p>Children‚Äôs Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA). The agency said Disney failed to properly label some videos that it uploaded to YouTube as ‚ÄúMade for Kids,‚Äù thus allowing it to gather data from children under 13 who watched that content and use it to serve targeted ads. In addition to the $10 million fine, the proposed settlement requires Disney to begin alerting parents before collecting personal data from children under age 13 and obtain their consent in accordance with COPPA. Disney is also required to start a program to ensure that videos it uploads to YouTube are properly designated as intended for kids.</p>

<p>Separately, the FTC is also taking action against a China-based robot toy maker, Apitor Technology, over allegedly permitting a third-party called
JPush
to collect children‚Äôs geolocation data without their knowledge and parental consent in violation of COPPA. ‚ÄúApitor integrated a third-party software development kit called JPush into its [Android] app that allowed JPush‚Äôs developer to collect location data and use it for any purpose, including advertising,‚Äù FTC
said
. ‚ÄúAfter Android users download the Apitor app, it begins collecting and sharing users‚Äô precise location data with JPush‚Äôs servers, unbeknownst to child users and their parents.‚Äù
