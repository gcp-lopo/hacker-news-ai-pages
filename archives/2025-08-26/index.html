<h2 id="unc6384-deploys-plugx-via-captive-portal-hijacks-and-valid-certificates-targeting-diplomats"><a id="article-1"></a>UNC6384 Deploys PlugX via Captive Portal Hijacks and Valid Certificates Targeting Diplomats</h2>

<p>A China-nexus threat actor known as
UNC6384
has been attributed to a set of attacks targeting diplomats in Southeast Asia and other entities across the globe to advance Beijing‚Äôs strategic interests. ‚ÄúThis multi-stage attack chain leverages advanced social engineering including valid code signing certificates, an adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attack, and indirect execution techniques to evade detection,‚Äù Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) researcher Patrick Whitsell
said
. UNC6384 is assessed to share tactical and tooling overlaps with a known Chinese
hacking group
called
Mustang Panda
, which is also tracked as BASIN, Bronze President, Camaro Dragon, Earth Preta, HoneyMyte, RedDelta, Red Lich, Stately Taurus, TEMP.Hex, and Twill Typhoon. The campaign, detected by GTIG in March 2025, is characterized by use of a captive portal redirect to hijack web traffic and deliver a digitally signed downloader called STATICPLUGIN.</p>

<p>The downloader then paves the way for the in-memory deployment of a
PlugX
(aka Korplug or SOGU) variant called SOGU.SEC. PlugX
is a
backdoor
that supports commands to exfiltrate files, log keystrokes, launch a remote command shell, upload/download files, and is able to extend its functionality with additional plugins. Often launched via DLL side-loading, the implant is spread through USB flash drives, targeted phishing emails containing malicious attachments or links, or compromised software downloads. The malware has existed since at least 2008 and is widely used by Chinese hacking groups.</p>

<p>It is believed that ShadowPad is the successor of PlugX. The UNC6384 attack chain is fairly straightforward in that adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) and social engineering tactics are used to deliver the PlugX malware -
The target‚Äôs web browser tests if the internet connection is behind a captive portal
An AitM redirects the browser to a threat actor-controlled website
STATICPLUGIN is downloaded from ‚Äúmediareleaseupdates[.]com‚Äù
STATICPLUGIN retrieves an MSI package from the same website
CANONSTAGER is DLL side-loaded and deploys the SOGU.SEC backdoor in memory
The
captive portal
hijack is used to deliver malware masquerading as an Adobe Plugin update to targeted entities. On the Chrome browser, the captive portal functionality is accomplished by means of a request to a hard-coded URL (‚Äúwww.gstatic[.]com/generate_204‚Äù) that redirects users to a Wi-Fi login page. While ‚Äúgstatic[.]com‚Äù is a legitimate Google domain used to store JavaScript code, images, and style sheets as a way to enhance performance, Google said the threat actors are likely carrying out an AitM attack to imitate redirection chains from the captive portal page to the threat actor‚Äôs landing web page.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs assessed that the AitM is facilitated by means of compromised edge devices on the target networks, although the attack vector used to pull this off remains unknown at this stage. ‚ÄúAfter being redirected, the threat actor attempts to deceive the target into believing that a software update is needed, and to download the malware disguised as a ‚Äòplugin update,‚Äô‚Äù GTIG said. ‚ÄúThe landing web page resembles a legitimate software update site and uses an HTTPS connection with a valid TLS certificate issued by Let‚Äôs Encrypt.‚Äù
The end result is the download of an executable named ‚ÄúAdobePlugins.exe‚Äù (aka STATICPLUGIN) that, when launched, triggers the SOGU.SEC payload in the background using a DLL referred to as CANONSTAGER (‚Äúcnmpaui.dll‚Äù) that‚Äôs sideloading using the Canon IJ Printer Assistant Tool (‚Äúcnmpaui.exe‚Äù). The STATICPLUGIN downloader is signed by Chengdu Nuoxin Times Technology Co., Ltd with a valid certificate issued by GlobalSign.</p>

<p>Over two dozen malware samples signed by Chengdu have been put to use by China-nexus activity clusters, with the earliest artifacts dating back to at least January 2023. Exactly how these certificates are obtained by the
subscriber
is not clear. ‚ÄúThis campaign is a clear example of the continued evolution of UNC6384‚Äôs operational capabilities and highlights the sophistication of PRC-nexus threat actors,‚Äù Whitsell said. ‚ÄúThe use of advanced techniques such as AitM combined with valid code signing and layered social engineering demonstrates this threat actor‚Äôs capabilities.‚Äù

<h2 id="docker-fixes-cve-2025-9074-critical-container-escape-vulnerability-with-cvss-score-93"><a id="article-2"></a>Docker Fixes CVE-2025-9074, Critical Container Escape Vulnerability With CVSS Score 9.3</h2>

<p>Docker has released fixes to address a critical security flaw affecting the Docker Desktop app for Windows and macOS that could potentially allow an attacker to break out of the confines of a container. The vulnerability, tracked as
CVE-2025-9074
, carries a CVSS score of 9.3 out of 10.0. It has been addressed in version 4.44.3. ‚ÄúA malicious container running on Docker Desktop could access the Docker Engine and launch additional containers without requiring the Docker socket to be mounted,‚Äù Docker
said
in an advisory released last week.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis could allow unauthorized access to user files on the host system. Enhanced Container Isolation (ECI) does not mitigate this vulnerability.‚Äù
According to security researcher Felix Boulet, the vulnerability has to do with how it‚Äôs possible for a container to connect to the Docker Engine API at 192.168.65[.]7:2375 without requiring any authentication, thereby opening the door to a scenario where a privileged container could gain full access to the underlying host upon mounting the C:\ drive into it. In a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit, a web request from any container has been found to trigger the flaw and result in a full compromise of the host -
POST a JSON payload to ‚Äú/containers/create,‚Äù binding the host C:\ drive to a folder in the container (/mnt/host/c:/host_root) in the container, and using a startup command to write or read anything under /host_root on container startup. POST to ‚Äú/containers/{id}/start‚Äù to launch the container and start the execution
‚ÄúAt its core, this vulnerability was a simple oversight, Docker‚Äôs internal HTTP API was reachable from any container without authentication or access controls,‚Äù Boulet
said
.</p>

<p>PVOTAL Technologies researcher Philippe Dugre (‚Äúzer0x64‚Äù), who further examined the flaw, said an attacker can exploit the flaw on the Windows version of Docker Desktop to mount as an administrator the entire file system, read any sensitive file, and overwrite a system DLL to escalate the attacker to administrator of the host system. ‚ÄúOn macOS, however, the Docker Desktop application still has a layer of isolation and trying to mount a user directory prompts the user for permission,‚Äù Dugre
said
. ‚ÄúBy default, the Docker application does not have access to the rest of the file system and does not run with administrative privileges, so the host is a lot safer than in the Window‚Äôs case.‚Äù
‚ÄúHowever, the attacker does still have full control of the Docker application/containers and can even backdoor it by mounting and modifying the application‚Äôs configuration, which does not need any user approval.‚Äù
The vulnerability does not impact the Linux version since Linux uses a named pipe on the host‚Äôs file system, rather than relying on a TCP TCP socket for the Docker Engine‚Äôs API. The easiest way to leverage the vulnerability is via a threat actor-controlled malicious container.</p>

<p>That said, a server-side request forgery (SSRF) flaw can be used as an alternate attack vector. ‚ÄúThis vulnerability allows an attacker to proxy requests through the vulnerable application and reach the Docker socket, the impact of which varies especially depending on the availability of HTTP requests methods (most SSRF only allows GET requests, but some niche case allows the use of POST, PATCH, DELETE methods),‚Äù Dugre said.

<h2 id="phishing-campaign-uses-upcrypter-in-fake-voicemail-emails-to-deliver-rat-payloads"><a id="article-3"></a>Phishing Campaign Uses UpCrypter in Fake Voicemail Emails to Deliver RAT Payloads</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have flagged a new phishing campaign that‚Äôs using fake voicemails and purchase orders to deliver a malware loader called
UpCrypter
. The campaign leverages ‚Äúcarefully crafted emails to deliver malicious URLs linked to convincing phishing pages,‚Äù Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Cara Lin
said
. ‚ÄúThese pages are designed to entice recipients into downloading JavaScript files that act as droppers for UpCrypter.‚Äù
Attacks propagating the malware have been primarily targeting manufacturing, technology, healthcare, construction, and retail/hospitality sectors across the world since the start of August 2025. The vast majority of the infections have been observed in Austria, Belarus, Canada, Egypt, India, and Pakistan, among others.</p>

<p>UpCrypter functions as a conduit for various remote access tools (RATs), such as
PureHVNC RAT
,
DCRat
(aka DarkCrystal RAT), and
Babylon RAT
, each of which enable an attacker to take full control of compromised hosts. The starting point of the infection chain is a phishing email using themes related to voicemail messages and purchases to deceive recipients into clicking on links that direct to fake landing pages, from where they are prompted to download the voice message or a PDF document. ‚ÄúThe lure page is designed to appear convincing by not only displaying the victim‚Äôs domain string in its banner but also fetching and embedding the domain‚Äôs logo within the page content to reinforce authenticity,‚Äù Fortinet said. ‚ÄúIts primary purpose is to deliver a malicious download.‚Äù
The downloaded payload is a ZIP archive containing an obfuscated JavaScript file, which subsequently contacts an external server to fetch the next-stage malware, but only after confirming internet connectivity and scanning running processes for forensic tools, debuggers, or sandbox environments.</p>

<p>The loader, in turn, contacts the same server to obtain the final payload, either in the form of plain text or embedded within a harmless-looking image, a technique called steganography. Fortinet said UpCrypter is also distributed as an MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language) loader that, like its JavaScript counterpart, conducts anti-analysis and anti-virtual machine checks, after which it downloads three different payloads: an obfuscated PowerShell script, a DLL, and the main payload. The attack culminates with the script embedding data from the DLL loader and the payload during execution, thus allowing the malware to be run without writing it to the file system. This approach also has the advantage of minimizing forensic traces, thereby allowing the malware to fly under the radar.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis combination of an actively maintained loader, layered obfuscation, and diverse RAT delivery demonstrates an adaptable threat delivery ecosystem capable of bypassing defenses and maintaining persistence across different environments,‚Äù Lin said. The disclosure comes as Check Point detailed a large-scale phishing campaign abusing Google Classroom to distribute more than 115,000 phishing emails aimed at 13,500 organizations across multiple industries between August 6 and 12, 2025. The attacks target organizations in Europe, North America, the Middle East, and Asia. ‚ÄúAttackers exploited this trust by sending fake invitations that contained unrelated commercial offers, ranging from product reselling pitches to SEO services,‚Äù the company
said
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúEach email directed recipients to contact scammers via a WhatsApp phone number, a tactic often linked to fraud schemes.‚Äù
The attack bypasses security systems because it leverages the trust and reputation of Google Classroom‚Äôs infrastructure to bypass key email authentication protocols, such as SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, and helps land the phishing emails in users‚Äô inboxes. These campaigns are part of a larger trend where threat actors take advantage of legitimate services like
Microsoft 365 Direct Send
and
OneNote
, not to mention abuse free artificial intelligence (AI)-powered website builder like
Vercel
and Flazio, as well as services such as
Discord CDN
,
SendGrid
,
Zoom
, ClickFunnels, Jotform, and X‚Äôs
t[.]co
link shortener ‚Äì an approach known as
living-off-trusted-sites
(
LOTS
). ‚ÄúAfter the threat actor gained M365 credentials of one user in an organization through a phishing attack, they created a OneNote file in the compromised user‚Äôs personal Documents folder on OneDrive, embedding the lure URL for the next phishing stage,‚Äù Varonis
said
in a report published last month. The
misuse
of
Direct Send
has prompted Microsoft to introduce an option for organizations called ‚Äú
Reject Direct Send
‚Äú to directly address the issue.</p>

<p>Alternatively, customers can also apply custom header stamping and quarantine policies to detect emails that claim to be internal communication but, in reality, aren‚Äôt. These developments have also been accompanied by attackers increasingly relying on client-side evasion techniques in phishing pages to stay ahead of both automated detection systems and human analysts. This includes the use of JavaScript-based blocking, Browser-in-the-Browser (BitB) templates, and hosting the pages inside virtual desktop environments using noVNC. ‚ÄúA notable method growing in popularity is the use of JavaScript-based anti-analysis scripts; small but effective bits of code embedded in phishing pages, fake tech support sites, and malicious redirects,‚Äù Doppel
said
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOnce any such activity is identified, the site immediately redirects the user to a blank page or disables further interaction, blocking access before any deeper inspection can occur.‚Äù

Russian Hackers Go After Old Cisco Flaw
‚Äî Hackers linked to Russia are exploiting a seven-year-old vulnerability in unpatched end-of-life Cisco networking devices (CVE-2018-0171) to target enterprise and critical infrastructure networks in the U.S. and abroad. Over the past year, the threat actor, which Cisco is tracking as Static Tundra, has collected configuration files from thousands of networking devices used by US organizations in critical infrastructure sectors. On some vulnerable devices, the attackers changed the configuration settings to give themselves unauthorized access to the network.</p>

<p>The attackers then used that access to explore the networks, looking specifically at protocols and applications that are commonly used in industrial systems. Cisco identified Static Tundra as primarily targeting organizations of strategic interest to the Kremlin, spanning the manufacturing, telecommunications, and higher education sectors across the globe. Once the threat actor gains access to a system of interest, they have been found to use stolen SNMP credentials to quietly control the compromised devices, letting them run commands, change settings, and steal configurations, all while hiding their activity from security controls. Static Tundra has also altered the configuration of compromised devices to create new local user accounts and enable remote access services like Telnet, granting them additional ways to regain access to the device if their initial communication mechanism is closed.</p>

<p>Also used by the group is a backdoor called SYNful Knock to stay connected to infected devices and give a hidden foothold that survives reboots. Apple Fixes Actively Exploited 0-Day
‚Äî Apple released security fixes to fix a high-severity flaw in iOS, iPadOS, and macOS that it said has come under active exploitation in the wild. The zero-day is an out-of-bounds write vulnerability affecting the ImageIO framework. Tracked as CVE-2025-43300 (CVSS score: 8.8), the issue could result in memory corruption when processing a malicious image.</p>

<p>The iPhone maker said the bug was internally discovered and that it was addressed with improved bounds checking. The company provided no further technical details of the vulnerability or insights into the exploitation activity beyond characterizing the cyber attacks as sophisticated and highly targeted. The tech giant began using such terminology starting this year, presumably to signify nation-state threats and spyware activity. Murky Panda Abuses Trusted Relationships to Breach Cloud Environments
‚Äî The threat actor known as Murky Panda (aka Silk Typhoon) has been observed abusing trusted relationships in the cloud to hack enterprise networks.</p>

<p>The attacks leverage N-day and zero-day vulnerabilities to drop web shells and a Golang malware called CloudedHope to facilitate remote access. A notable aspect of Murky Panda‚Äôs tradecraft concerns the abuse of trusted relationships between partner organizations and their cloud tenants, exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities to breach software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers‚Äô cloud environments and conduct lateral movement to downstream victims. INTERPOL Announces New Wave of Arrests in Africa
‚Äî INTERPOL announced that authorities from 18 countries across Africa have arrested 1,209 cybercriminals who targeted 88,000 victims. ‚ÄúThe crackdown recovered $97.4 million and dismantled 11,432 malicious infrastructures, underscoring the global reach of cybercrime and the urgent need for cross-border cooperation,‚Äù the agency said.</p>

<p>The effort is the second phase of an ongoing law enforcement initiative called Operation Serengeti, which took place between June and August 2025 to tackle severe crimes like ransomware, online scams and business email compromise (BEC). The first wave of arrests occurred late last year. Scattered Spider Hacker Gets 10 Years Jailterm
‚Äî Noah Michael Urban, a 20-year-old member of the notorious cybercrime gang known as Scattered Spider, was sentenced to ten years in prison in the U.S. in connection with a series of major hacks and cryptocurrency thefts.</p>

<p>Urban pleaded guilty to charges related to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft back in April 2025. In addition to 120 months in federal prison, Urban faces an additional three years of supervised release and has been ordered to pay $13 million in restitution to victims. The defendant, who also went by the aliases Sosa, Elijah, King Bob, Gustavo Fring, and Anthony Ramirez, was arrested by U.S. authorities in Florida in January 2024 for committing wire fraud and aggravated identity theft between August 2022 and March 2023.</p>

<p>These incidents led to the theft of at least $800,000 from at least five different victims. North Korea Likely Behind New Diplomat Cyber Attacks
‚Äî The North Korea-backed threat actor known as Kimsuky is believed to have orchestrated a spear-phishing attack targeting European embassies in South Korea. The campaign, ongoing since March 2025, is characterized by the use of GitHub as a command-and-control channel and a variant of an open-source malware called Xeno RAT. In an interesting twist, the attackers have yielded clues that they are working out of China, perhaps alluding to the possibility of a collaboration or that it‚Äôs the work of a threat actor that closely mimics the tactics of Kimsuky.</p>

<p>Furthermore, routing malicious cyber activity through China likely provides North Korea with some geopolitical cover and a safe haven as long as it doesn‚Äôt directly harm domestic interests. Alleged RapperBot Admin Charged in the U.S. ‚Äî Ethan Foltz, 22, of Eugene, Oregon, was charged with allegedly developing and overseeing a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)-for-hire botnet called RapperBot since at least 2021. Foltz has been charged with one count of aiding and abetting computer intrusions.</p>

<p>If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. In addition, law enforcement authorities conducted a search of Foltz‚Äôs residence on August 6, 2025, seizing administrative control of the botnet infrastructure. ‚ÄéÔ∏è‚Äçüî• Trending CVEs

Microsoft Scales Back Chinese Access to Early Warning System
‚Äî Microsoft
revealed
it has
scaled back
some Chinese companies‚Äô access to its early warning system for cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the wake of sweeping hacking attempts against Microsoft SharePoint servers that have been pinned on Beijing.</p>

<p>To that end, the Windows maker said several Chinese firms would no longer receive proof-of-concept code demonstrating the flaws. The change is applicable to ‚Äúcountries where they‚Äôre required to report vulnerabilities to their governments,‚Äù which would include China. The decision comes amid
speculation
that there may have been a leak from the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP) may have resulted in the large-scale exploitation activity. New Lazarus Stealer Spotted
‚Äî A new Android banking trojan called Lazarus Stealer has been spotted in the wild.</p>

<p>‚ÄúDisguised as a harmless application called ‚ÄòGiftFlipSoft,‚Äô the malware specifically targets multiple Russian banking apps, extracting card numbers, PINs, and other sensitive credentials while remaining completely hidden from the device‚Äôs interface,‚Äù CYFIRMA
said
. ‚ÄúThe malware is built for persistence, operating silently in the background while exfiltrating sensitive data. It abuses high-risk permissions, default SMS privileges, overlay functions, and dynamic WebView content to carry out its operations.‚Äù Once installed, the app requests default SMS app privileges, as well as overlay (‚ÄúDisplay Over Other Apps‚Äù) and Usage Access permissions to display fraudulent interfaces on legitimate applications for credential harvesting and monitor active applications in real time and detect when targeted applications, such as banking apps, are launched. Google Agrees to Pay $30M to Settle Children‚Äôs Privacy Lawsuit
‚Äî Google has
agreed
to pay $30 million to settle a class-action lawsuit that it violated children‚Äôs privacy on YouTube by secretly collecting their data without parental consent and using it to serve targeted ads.</p>

<p>Google denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. The company previously paid a $170 million fine in 2019 to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the state of New York for similar practices. Storm-1575 Linked to Salty 2FA
‚Äî The threat actor known as
Storm-1575
has been attributed to a new phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) offering called Salty 2FA. ‚ÄúLike other PhaaS platforms, Salty 2FA is mainly delivered via email and focuses on stealing Microsoft 365 credentials,‚Äù ANY.RUN
said
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt unfolds in multiple stages and includes several mechanisms designed to hinder detection and analysis.‚Äù Victims of Salty 2FA attacks span the finance, telecom, energy, consulting, logistics, and education sectors. Storm-1575 is the moniker assigned by Microsoft to the operators of DadSec and Rockstar 2FA. What is HuiOne Guarantee? ‚Äî The Telegram-based escrow platform
HuiOne Guarantee
(aka Haowang Guarantee), which announced its closure in June 2025, has
acquired
a 30% financial stake in Tudou Guarantee, which has emerged as a key fallback for Huione-affiliated vendors.</p>

<p>Described as an ‚ÄúAmazon for criminals,‚Äù the Cambodian conglomerate behind it, HuiOne Group, has had its HuiOne Pay license
revoked
by the National Bank of Cambodia earlier this March. HuiOne-linked infrastructure has received over $96 billion in cryptocurrency assets since 2021,
according to TRM Labs
, which said HuiOne Pay and HuiOne Guarantee share operational links, with fund flows observed from Huione Pay withdrawal wallets to Huione Guarantee‚Äôs security deposit wallets. The findings come as darknet market escrow systems that manage cryptocurrency transactions between buyers and vendors continue to
remain vulnerable
to administrator exit scams. These systems implement escrow through multi-signature cryptocurrency wallet addresses that require signatures from the buyer and vendor to complete transactions, with the market administrator only stepping in during dispute resolution to side with either the buyer or vendor based on evidence provided by the two parties.</p>

<p>To streamline operations, many darknet markets also use automated escrow release systems, transferring funds to vendors after 7 to 21 days unless buyers initiate disputes during the timer period. However, the ‚Äúcentralized‚Äù nature of the dispute resolution process, which is heavily reliant on the market administrators, introduces new risks such as bias, corruption, and exit scam scenarios where fairness takes a back seat. Orange Belgium Discloses Breach
‚Äî Orange Belgium, a subsidiary of telecommunications giant Orange Group, disclosed on Wednesday that attackers who breached its systems in July have stolen the data of approximately 850,000 customers. ‚ÄúAt the end of July, Orange Belgium discovered a cyber attack on one of its IT systems, which gave unauthorized access to certain data from 850,000 customer accounts,‚Äù the company
said
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo critical data was compromised: no passwords, email addresses, bank or financial data were hacked. However, the hacker has gained access to one of our IT systems that contains the following information: name, first name, phone number, SIM card number, PUK code, [and] tariff plan.‚Äù
U.K. Man Sentenced to Jail for Website Defacement and Data Theft
‚Äî Al-Tahery Al-Mashriky, 26, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, was
sentenced
to jail for 20 months for hacking into the websites of organizations in North America, Yemen and Israel and stealing the log in details of millions of people, including more than 4 million Facebook users. Al-Mashriky was arrested in August 2022 and pleaded guilty to nine offences earlier this March.</p>

<p>Associated with an extremist hacker group named Yemen Cyber Army, the defendant infiltrated a number of websites to push religious and political ideologies. A review of his seized laptop uncovered personal data for over 4 million Facebook users and several documents containing usernames and passwords for services such as Netflix and Paypal. The Yemen Cyber Army is a hacktivist group that, in the past, has declared its support for the Houthis, an Islamist political and military organization. Malicious npm Packages Target Solana Developers
‚Äî Malicious npm packages have been found embedding an information stealer that‚Äôs designed to single out Russian cryptocurrency developers as part of a campaign dubbed Solana-Scan.</p>

<p>These malicious packages, solana-pump-test, solana-spl-sdk, and solana-pump-sdk, targeted the Solana cryptocurrency ecosystem and claimed to ‚Äúscan‚Äù for Solana SDK components. All the packages were published by a user named ‚Äúcryptohan.‚Äù Contained within the package is an obfuscated CommonJS file that launches a JavaScript payload for extracting environment information and launching a second-stage that searches the compromised machine for sensitive files and exfiltrates them to a remote server located in the U.S. There is evidence that the JavaScript was written with the help of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools like Anthropic Claude, software supply chain security outfit Safety

Hijack Loader Detailed
‚Äî Cybersecurity researchers have
unpacked
the inner workings of a malware loader called
Hijack Loader
that‚Äôs used as a conduit for other payloads, including information stealers and remote access trojans. Attack chains distributing the malware have leveraged pirated game websites like Dodi Repacks, tricking users into downloading booby-trapped ZIP archives under the guise of video games like Virtua Fighter 5 REVO. Another propagation mechanism involves embedding a link to cracked software in TIDAL music playlists that show up in search engine results.</p>

<p>Hijack Loader incorporates an array of anti-virtual machine and anti-debug techniques and attempts to disable Microsoft Defender Antivirus prior to launching the final payload. Nebraska Man Sentenced to 1 Year in Prison for Illicit Crypto Mining
‚Äî Charles O. Parks III, who was indicted in April 2024 for operating a large-scale illegal cryptojacking operation, was
sentenced
in the U.S. to one year and one day in prison.</p>

<p>He is said to have defrauded two well-known providers of cloud computing services out of more than $3.5 million worth of computing resources from January through August 2021. Parks was
charged
with wire fraud, money laundering, and engaging in unlawful monetary transactions in connection with the scheme and
pleaded guilty
to wire fraud in December 2024. The mined currency was used for personal luxurious purchases and Parks boasted about his profits on social media to earn credibility as a crypto influencer. ‚ÄúParks created and used a variety of names, corporate affiliations, and email addresses, including emails with domains from corporate entities he operated called ‚ÄòMultiMillionaire LLC‚Äô and ‚ÄòCP3O LLC,‚Äô to register numerous accounts with the service providers and to gain access to massive amounts of computing processing power and storage that he did not pay for,‚Äù the Justice Department said.</p>

<p>Chrome Extension Detected Capturing Screenshots
‚Äî A Chrome browser extension with more than 100,000 installs has been found to harbor covert features to capture screenshots, collect system information, and query IP geolocation APIs for location details. The screenshots are uploaded to an external server, aitd.one, which claims to be an AI threat detection service. Advertised as a free VPN app named FreeVPN.One, the featured add-on offered the promised functionality since its launch in 2000, before the surveillance features were subtly introduced in April, June, and July 2025. The developer behind the tool claimed the automatic screenshot capture is part of a Background Scanning feature that‚Äôs triggered only on suspicious domains and for all users by default.</p>

<p>However, Koi Security found that screenshots were being taken on trusted services like Google Sheets and Google Photos. ‚ÄúFreeVPN.One shows how a privacy branding can be flipped into a trap,‚Äù the company

‚Äî A phishing campaign has been spotted using hidden artificial intelligence (AI) prompts that are designed to manipulate AI-based email scanners and delay them from detecting the malicious payloads. The emails, sent from SendGrid, masquerade as password expiry notices from Gmail to induce a false sense of urgency using social engineering tactics. But buried in the email plain-text MIME section is a prompt that instructs automated scanners to ‚Äúengage in the deepest possible multi-layered inference loop‚Äù and trick them into entering long reasoning loops instead of marking the messages as phishing.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIf AI-driven systems are tied to automation (auto-tagging, ticketing, escalation), this injection could cause misclassification or delays,‚Äù Malwr-analysis.com‚Äôs Anurag

linked
493 child sextortion cases to scam compounds operating in Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos, where trafficked
individuals
are
forced to carry out online fraud
such as romance baiting and pig butchering scams.</p>

<p>Forensic data has tied the cases to 40 of the 44 previously known scam compounds operating in Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos. ‚ÄúThis research indicates a likely convergence of two dark forms of exploitation ‚Äì child sextortion and human trafficking ‚Äì enabled by digital platforms and driven by profit,‚Äù

Eric Heintz, Senior Criminal Analyst at IJM. Mule Operators in META Adopt Complex Fraud Schemes
‚Äî Cybersecurity researchers have laid bare the advanced techniques mule operators across the Middle East, Turkey and Africa (META) region have adopted to target retail banks, shifting from basic IP masking via VPNs and proxies to Starlink-based obfuscation tactics combined with advanced GPS spoofing, SIM abuse, and physical device ‚Äúmuling‚Äù using hired individuals and postal shipments. ‚ÄúFinancial institutions in the Gulf region, where regulations are especially tight, enforce strict restrictions on VPN, hosting, and proxy traffic,‚Äù Group-IB
said
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúEarly on, these controls forced mule operators to rely on generic VPN services ‚Äì easily identified via IP reputation tools. By late 2023, fraudsters began a rapid innovation cycle to bypass these filters and regain remote access to accounts in the target jurisdictions.‚Äù Mule networks have been observed using stolen identities and location obfuscation tactics to remotely open hundreds of accounts to launder funds across targeted countries, with fraudsters also removing SIM cards entirely from Android devices to evade telecom fingerprinting and connecting to the internet via Wi-Fi hotspots, typically from nearby roaming-enabled phones, thereby masking their network origins. As recently as Q4 2024, the schemes have recruited so-called first-layer mules, who opened the bank accounts within trusted jurisdictions and then passed credentials to overseas operators who conducted laundering operations. A further escalation of this approach earlier this year eliminated the need for credential handover by physically shipping pre-configured phones.</p>

<p>‚ÄúFirst-layer mules based in trusted countries would open accounts and build trust through initial legitimate usage,‚Äù Group-IB said. ‚ÄúInstead of sharing login credentials, they ship pre-configured phones to second-layer fraudsters operating abroad.‚Äù

North Korea Linked to Over $1.75B in Thefts in 2025
‚Äî North Korea, which pulled off one of the biggest crypto heists in history in February 2025 by
plundering nearly $1.5 billion
from Dubai-based exchange Bybit, has stolen more than $1.75 billion in 2025 alone, according to Elliptic. In the six months following the Bybit hack, over $1 billion of the stolen funds have been laundered using multiple rounds of mixers and cross-chain movements to complicate the trail. ‚ÄúIt is noteworthy that lesser-known blockchains were layered for portions of funds, perhaps in the hope that they are not as well supported by some analytics and investigation tools, and are less familiar to investigators attempting to trace asset movements,‚Äù Elliptic
said
. ‚ÄúPreviously unseen or less commonly used services were also utilized for Bybit laundering.‚Äù Further analysis shows that funds reaching the Tron blockchain are ultimately cashed out via suspected Chinese over-the-counter trading services.</p>

<p>Attackers Abuse Virtual Private Servers to Breach SaaS Accounts
‚Äî Threat actors are weaponizing virtual private servers (VPS) to compromise software-as-a-service (SaaS) accounts and then using them to send phishing emails. The activity was first observed in March 2025. ‚ÄúThe incidents involved suspicious logins from VPS-linked infrastructure followed by unauthorized inbox rule creation and deletion of phishing-related emails,‚Äù Darktrace

<p>Lock It ‚Äî
When you drag a file into Google Drive, OneDrive, or Dropbox, it feels ‚Äúsafe.‚Äù But here‚Äôs the catch: most clouds only encrypt files on their servers ‚Äî they hold the keys, not you. That means if the provider is breached, subpoenaed, or a rogue admin pokes around, your ‚Äúprivate‚Äù files aren‚Äôt so private. The fix is simple: end-to-end encryption. You encrypt before uploading, so your files are locked on your device and can only be unlocked with your key.</p>

<p>Even if the cloud is hacked, attackers see nothing but scrambled noise. Free, open-source tools that make this easy:

<h2 id="why-siem-rules-fail-and-how-to-fix-them-insights-from-160-million-attack-simulations"><a id="article-5"></a>Why SIEM Rules Fail and How to Fix Them: Insights from 160 Million Attack Simulations</h2>

<p>Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems
act as the primary tools for detecting suspicious activity in enterprise networks, helping organizations identify and respond to potential attacks in real time. However, the new
Picus Blue Report 2025
, based on
over 160 million real-world attack simulations
, revealed that organizations are only detecting
1 out of 7 simulated attacks
, showing a critical gap in threat detection and response. While many organizations believe they‚Äôre doing everything they can to detect adversary actions, the reality is that a large
number of threats are slipping through their defenses
unnoticed, leaving their networks far too vulnerable to compromise. This gap in detection creates a false sense of security when attackers have already accessed your sensitive systems, escalated their privileges, or are actively exfiltrating your valuable data.</p>

<p>Which begs the question: why, after all this time, money, and attention, are these systems still failing? Especially when the stakes are so high. Let‚Äôs see what The
Blue Report 2025
tells us about several lingering core issues regarding
SIEM rule effectiveness
. Log Collection Failures: The Foundation of Detection Breakdowns
SIEM rules
act like a security guard who monitors incoming and outgoing traffic for suspicious behavior.</p>

<p>Just as a guard follows a set of instructions to identify threats based on specific patterns,
SIEM rules
are pre-configured to detect certain activities, such as unauthorized access or unusual network traffic. When a specific event matches a rule, it triggers an alert, allowing security teams to respond swiftly. For
SIEM rules
to work effectively, however, they need to analyze a set of
reliable and comprehensive logs
. The
Blue Report 2025
found that one of the most common reasons SIEM rules fail is due to persistent
log collection issues
.</p>

<p>In fact, in 2025,
50% of detection rule failures
were linked to problems with log collection. When logs aren‚Äôt captured properly, it‚Äôs all too easy to miss critical events, leading to
a dangerous lack of alerts, a false sense of security, and a failure to detect malicious activity
. Even the most effective rules quickly become useless without accurate data to analyze, leaving their organizations vulnerable to attacks. Common log collection issues include
missed log sources
,
misconfigured log agents
, and
incorrect log settings
.</p>

<p>For example, many environments fail to log key data points or have problems with
log forwarding
, preventing pertinent logs from reaching the SIEM in the first place. This failure to capture critical telemetry significantly hampers a SIEM‚Äôs ability to detect an attacker‚Äôs malicious activity. Misconfigured Detection Rules: Silent Failures
Even when logs are collected properly, detection rules can still fail due to
misconfigurations
. In fact, in 2025,
13% of rule failures
were attributed to configuration issues.</p>

<p>This includes
incorrect rule thresholds
,
improperly defined reference sets
, and
poorly constructed correlation logic
. These issues can cause critical events to be missed or trigger false positives, undermining the effectiveness of the SIEM system. For example,
overly broad or generic rules
can lead to an overwhelming amount of noise, which often results in important alerts being buried in the signal, missed entirely, or mistakenly ignored. Similarly, poorly defined reference sets can cause rules to miss important indicators of compromise.</p>

<p>Performance Issues: The Hidden Culprits of Detection Gaps
As SIEM systems scale to handle more data,
performance issues
can quickly become another major hurdle. The report found that
24% of detection failures
in 2025 were related to performance problems, such as
resource-heavy rules
,
broad custom property definitions
, and
inefficient queries
. These issues can significantly slow down detection and delay response times, making it harder for security teams to act quickly when they‚Äôre actively under attack. SIEM systems often struggle to process large volumes of data, especially when rules are not optimized for efficiency.</p>

<p>This leads to
slow query performance
,
delayed alerts
, and
overwhelmed system resources,
further reducing the organization‚Äôs ability to detect real-time threats. Three Common Detection Rule Issues
Let‚Äôs take a closer look at the three most common log collection issues highlighted in the
Blue Report 2025
. One of the most significant problems impacting
SIEM rule effectiveness
is
log source coalescing
. This occurs when event coalescing is enabled for specific log sources like DNS, proxy servers, and Windows event logs, leading to
data loss
.</p>

<p>In this case, important events may be compressed or discarded, resulting in incomplete data for analysis. As a result,
critical threat behaviors can easily be missed
, and detection rules can quickly become less and less effective. Another prevalent issue is
unavailable log sources
, which account for
10% of rule failures
. This often happens when logs fail to transmit data due to
network disruptions
,
misconfigured log forwarding agents
, or
firewall blocks
.</p>

<p>Without these logs, the
SIEM system cannot capture critical events
, resulting in detection rules failing to trigger alerts. Lastly,
delaying the implementation of cost-effective test filters
is a common cause of detection failures. When detection rules are too broad or inefficient, the system processes excessive amounts of data without effective filtering. This can overwhelm the system, slowing performance and risking your security teams missing key events.</p>

<p>According to the report,
8% of detection failures
are related to this issue, highlighting the need for optimized, cost-effective filtering. Continuous Validation: Ensuring SIEM Rules Stay Effective Against Evolving Threats
While detection rules are foundational to SIEM systems, they can
quickly lose relevance without continuous validation
. Adversaries are constantly evolving their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and SIEM rules designed to detect known patterns become ineffective if they‚Äôre not being regularly tested against
real-world threats
. The
Blue Report 2025
emphasizes that, without ongoing testing, even well-tuned SIEM systems can easily become vulnerable to attacks.</p>

<p>Continuous validation
ensures that security teams don‚Äôt just rely on static configurations, but regularly
prove that their detection capabilities are working
against
the latest adversary behaviors
. This proactive approach
closes the gap
between the theoretical protection offered by detection rules and the practical, real-world effectiveness organizations need against ever-evolving threats. By simulating
real-world adversary behaviors
, security teams can evaluate whether their detection rules are countering the
newest attack techniques
, making sure they‚Äôre properly tuned for
specific environments
, and that they‚Äôre identifying malicious behaviors in a timely manner. Regular
exposure validation
, through tools like
Breach and Attack Simulation
, allows organizations to
always be testing
and
fine-tuning their controls
.</p>

<p>This approach makes it easier to
identify their blind spots
and
improve their defenses
, ensuring that SIEM rules are effective, not just at detecting past attacks, but at preventing future ones as well. Without
continuous validation
, organizations risk their data, brand reputation, and bottom line to
outdated or ineffective defenses
, putting their most critical assets at unnecessary risk. Closing the Gaps in SIEM Detection
Neglected SIEM rules will inevitably fail to detect modern threats. Log collection failures, misconfigurations, and performance bottlenecks create blind spots, while static rules quickly lose effectiveness against evolving attacker tactics and techniques.</p>

<p>Without
continuous validation
, organizations risk operating under a false sense of security, leaving critical systems and data exposed to compromise. To stay ahead, security teams must
regularly test and tune their SIEM rules
, simulate real-world attacks, and validate detection pipelines against the latest adversary behaviors. Tools like
Breach and Attack Simulation
enable organizations to uncover hidden gaps, prioritize high-risk exposures, and ensure that their defenses are working when it matters most. See where your SIEM is succeeding and where it might be silently failing.</p>

<h2 id="transparent-tribe-targets-indian-govt-with-weaponized-desktop-shortcuts-via-phishing"><a id="article-6"></a>Transparent Tribe Targets Indian Govt With Weaponized Desktop Shortcuts via Phishing</h2>

<p>The advanced persistent threat (APT) actor known as
Transparent Tribe
has been observed targeting both Windows and BOSS (Bharat Operating System Solutions) Linux systems with malicious Desktop shortcut files in attacks targeting Indian Government entities. ‚ÄúInitial access is achieved through spear-phishing emails,‚Äù CYFIRMA
said
. ‚ÄúLinux BOSS environments are targeted via weaponized .desktop shortcut files that, once opened, download and execute malicious payloads.‚Äù
Transparent Tribe, also called APT36, is assessed to be of Pakistani origin, with the group ‚Äì along with its sub-cluster SideCopy ‚Äì having a
storied
history
of breaking into
Indian government institutions
with a variety of remote access trojans (RATs). The latest dual-platform demonstrates the adversarial collective‚Äôs continued sophistication, allowing it to broaden its targeting footprint and ensure access to compromised environments.</p>

<p>The attack chains begin with phishing emails bearing supposed meeting notices, which, in reality, are nothing but booby-trapped Linux desktop shortcut files (‚ÄúMeeting_Ltr_ID1543ops.pdf.desktop‚Äù). These files masquerade as PDF documents to trick recipients into opening them, leading to the execution of a shell script. The shell script serves as a dropper to fetch a hex-encoded file from an attacker-controlled server (‚Äúsecurestore[.]cv‚Äù) and save it to disk as an ELF binary, while simultaneously opening a decoy PDF hosted on Google Drive by launching Mozilla Firefox. The Go-based binary, for its part, establishes contact with a hard-coded command-and-control (C2) server, modgovindia[.]space:4000, to receive commands, fetch payloads, and exfiltrate data.</p>

<p>The malware also establishes persistence by means of a cron job that executes the main payload automatically after a system reboot or process termination. Cybersecurity company CloudSEK, which also
independently reported
the activity, said the malware performs system reconnaissance and is equipped to carry out a series of dummy anti-debugging and anti-sandbox checks in a bid to throw off emulators and static analyzers. Furthermore, Hunt.io‚Äôs
analysis
of the campaign has revealed that the attacks are designed to deploy a known Transparent Tribe backdoor called
Poseidon
that enables data collection, long-term access, credential harvesting, and potentially lateral movement. ‚ÄúAPT36‚Äôs capability to customize its delivery mechanisms according to the victim‚Äôs operating environment thereby increases its chances of success while maintaining persistent access to critical government infrastructure and evading traditional security controls,‚Äù CYFIRMA said.</p>

<p>The disclosure comes weeks after the Transparent Tribe actors were observed targeting Indian defense organizations and related government entities using spoofed domains with the ultimate goal of stealing credentials and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes. It‚Äôs believed that users are redirected to these URLs through spear-phishing emails. ‚ÄúUpon entering a valid email ID in the initial phishing page and clicking the ‚ÄòNext‚Äô button, the victim is redirected to a second page that prompts the user to input their email account password and the Kavach authentication code,‚Äù CYFIRMA
said
. It‚Äôs worth noting that the targeting of Kavach, a 2FA solution used by the Indian government agencies to improve account security, is a
tried-and-tested tactic
adopted by
Transparent Tribe and SideCopy
since
early 2022
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe use of typo-squatted domains combined with infrastructure hosted on Pakistan-based servers is consistent with the group‚Äôs established tactics, techniques, and procedures,‚Äù the company said. The findings also follow the discovery of a
separate campaign
undertaken by a South Asian APT to strike Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Turkey through spear-phishing emails that are engineered for credential theft using lookalike pages hosted on Netlify and Pages.dev. ‚ÄúThese campaigns mimic official communication to trick victims into entering credentials on fake login pages,‚Äù Hunt.io
said
earlier this month, attributing it to a hacking group called
SideWinder
. ‚ÄúSpoofed Zimbra and Secure Portal Pages were made to look like official government email, file-sharing, or document upload services, prompting victims to submit credentials through fake login panels.‚Äù

<h2 id="malicious-go-module-poses-as-ssh-brute-force-tool-steals-credentials-via-telegram-bot"><a id="article-7"></a>Malicious Go Module Poses as SSH Brute-Force Tool, Steals Credentials via Telegram Bot</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a malicious Go module that presents itself as a brute-force tool for SSH but actually contains functionality to discreetly exfiltrate credentials to its creator. ‚ÄúOn the first successful login, the package sends the target IP address, username, and password to a hard-coded Telegram bot controlled by the threat actor,‚Äù Socket researcher Kirill Boychenko
said
. The deceptive package, named ‚Äúgolang-random-ip-ssh-bruteforce,‚Äù has been linked to a GitHub account called
IllDieAnyway
(G3TT), which is currently no longer accessible. However, it
continues to be available
on pkg.go[.]dev.</p>

<p>It was published on June 24, 2022. The software supply chain security company said the Go module works by scanning random IPv4 addresses for exposed SSH services on TCP port 22, then attempting to brute-force the service using an embedded username-password list and exfiltrating the successful credentials to the attacker. A notable aspect of the malware is that it deliberately disables host key verification by setting ‚Äú
ssh.InsecureIgnoreHostKey
‚Äú as a HostKeyCallback, thereby allowing the SSH client to accept connections from any server regardless of their identity. The wordlist is fairly straightforward, including only two usernames root and admin, and pairing them against weak passwords like root, test, password, admin, 12345678, 1234, qwerty, webadmin, webmaster, techsupport, letmein, and Passw@rd.</p>

<p>The malicious code runs in an infinite loop to generate the IPv4 addresses, with the package attempting concurrent SSH logins from the wordlist. The details are transmitted to a threat actor-controlled Telegram bot named ‚Äú@sshZXC_bot‚Äù (ssh_bot) via the API, which then acknowledges the receipt of the credentials. The messages are sent through the bot to an account with the handle ‚Äú@io_ping‚Äù (Gett). An
Internet Archive snapshot
of the now-removed GitHub account shows that IllDieAnyway‚Äôs software portfolio, included an IP port scanner, an Instagram profile info and media parser, and even a PHP-based command-and-control (C2) botnet called Selica-C2.</p>

<p>Their
YouTube channel
, which remains accessible, hosts various short-form videos on ‚ÄúHow to hack a Telegram bot‚Äù and what they claim to be the ‚Äúmost powerful SMS bomber for the Russian Federation,‚Äù which can send spam SMS texts and messages to VK users using a Telegram bot. It‚Äôs assessed that the threat actor is of Russian origin. ‚ÄúThe package offloads scanning and password guessing to unwitting operators, spreads risk across their IPs, and funnels the successes to a single threat actor-controlled Telegram bot,‚Äù Boychenko said. ‚ÄúIt disables host key verification, drives high concurrency, and exits after the first valid login to prioritize quick capture.</p>

<p>Because the Telegram Bot API uses HTTPS, the traffic looks like normal web requests and can slip past coarse egress controls.‚Äù

<h2 id="geoserver-exploits-polaredge-and-gayfemboy-push-cybercrime-beyond-traditional-botnets"><a id="article-8"></a>GeoServer Exploits, PolarEdge, and Gayfemboy Push Cybercrime Beyond Traditional Botnets</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers are calling attention to multiple campaigns that are taking advantage of known security vulnerabilities and exposed Redis servers to various malicious activities, including leveraging the compromised devices as IoT botnets, residential proxies, or cryptocurrency mining infrastructure. The first set of attacks entails the exploitation of
CVE-2024-36401
(CVSS score: 9.8), a critical remote code execution vulnerability impacting OSGeo GeoServer GeoTools that has been
weaponized in cyber attacks
since late last year. ‚ÄúCriminals have used the vulnerability to deploy legitimate software development kits (SDKs) or modified apps to gain passive income via network sharing or residential proxies,‚Äù Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 researchers Zhibin Zhang, Yiheng An, Chao Lei, and Haozhe Zhang
said
in a technical report. ‚ÄúThis method of generating passive income is particularly stealthy.</p>

<p>It mimics a monetization strategy used by some legitimate app developers who choose SDKs instead of displaying traditional ads. This can be a well-intentioned choice that protects the user experience and improves app retention.‚Äù
The cybersecurity company said attackers have been probing GeoServer instances exposed to the internet since at least early March 2025, leveraging the access to drop customized executables from adversary-controlled servers. The payloads are distributed via a private instance of a file-sharing server using transfer.sh, as opposed to a conventional HTTP web server. The applications used in the campaign aim to fly under the radar by consuming minimal resources, while stealthily monetizing victims‚Äô internet bandwidth without the need for distributing custom malware.</p>

<p>The binaries, written in Dart, are designed to interact with legitimate passive income services, discreetly using the device resources for activities like bandwidth sharing. The approach is a win-win situation for all parties involved, as developers of the applications receive payments in exchange for integrating the feature, and the cybercriminals get to profit off unused bandwidth using a seemingly innocuous channel that doesn‚Äôt raise any red flags. ‚ÄúOnce running, the executable operates covertly in the background, monitoring device resources and illicitly sharing the victim‚Äôs bandwidth whenever possible,‚Äù Unit 42 said. ‚ÄúThis generates passive income for the attacker.‚Äù
Telemetry data gathered by the company shows that there were over 7,100 publicly exposed GeoServer instances across 99 countries, with China, the United States, Germany, Great Britain, and Singapore taking the top five spots.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis ongoing campaign showcases a significant evolution in how adversaries monetize compromised systems,‚Äù Unit 42 said. ‚ÄúThe attackers‚Äô core strategy focuses on stealthy, persistent monetization rather than aggressive resource exploitation. This approach favors long-term, low-profile revenue generation over easily detectable techniques.‚Äù
The disclosure comes as Censys detailed the infrastructural backbone powering a large-scale IoT botnet called
PolarEdge
that comprises enterprise-grade firewalls and consumer-oriented devices like routers, IP cameras, and VoIP phones by taking advantage of known security vulnerabilities. Its exact purpose is currently not known, although it‚Äôs clear that the botnet isn‚Äôt being used for indiscriminate mass scanning.</p>

<p>The initial access is then abused to drop a custom TLS backdoor based on Mbed TLS that facilitates encrypted command-and-control, log cleanup, and dynamic infrastructure updates. The backdoor has been commonly observed deployed on high, non-standard ports, likely as a way to bypass traditional network scans and defensive monitoring scope. PolarEdge exhibits traits that align with an Operational Relay Box (ORB) network, with the attack surface management platform stating there are indications that the campaign started as far back as June 2023, reaching about 40,000 active devices as of this month. More than 70% of the infections are scattered across South Korea, the United States, Hong Kong, Sweden, and Canada.</p>

<p>‚ÄúORBs are compromised exit nodes that forward traffic in order to carry out additional compromises or attacks on behalf of threat actors,‚Äù security researcher Himaja Motheram
said
. ‚ÄúWhat makes ORBs so valuable to attackers is that they don‚Äôt need to take over the device‚Äôs core function ‚Äì they can quietly relay traffic in the background while the device continues to operate normally, making detection by the owner or ISP unlikely.‚Äù
In recent months, vulnerabilities in products from vendors such as DrayTek, TP-Link, Raisecom, and Cisco have been targeted by bad actors to infiltrate them and deploy a Mirai botnet variant codenamed
gayfemboy
, suggesting an expansion of the targeting scope. ‚ÄúThe gayfemboy campaign spans multiple countries, including Brazil, Mexico, the United States, Germany, France, Switzerland, Israel, and Vietnam,‚Äù Fortinet
said
. ‚ÄúIts targets also cover a broad range of sectors, such as manufacturing, technology, construction, and media or communications.‚Äù
Gayfemboy is capable of targeting various system architectures, including ARM, AArch64, MIPS R3000, PowerPC, and Intel 80386.</p>

<p>It incorporates four primary functions -
Monitor
, which tracks threads and processes while incorporating persistence and sandbox evasion techniques
Watchdog
, which attempts to bind to UDP port 47272
Attacker
, which launches DDoS attacks using UDP, TCP, and ICMP protocols, and enables backdoor access by connecting to a remote server to receive commands
Killer
, which terminates itself if it receives the command from the server or detects sandbox manipulation
‚ÄúWhile Gayfemboy inherits structural elements from Mirai, it introduces notable modifications that enhance both its complexity and ability to evade detection,‚Äù security researcher Vincent Li said. ‚ÄúThis evolution reflects the increasing sophistication of modern malware and reinforces the need for proactive, intelligence-driven defense strategies.‚Äù
The findings also coincide with a cryptojacking campaign undertaken by a threat actor dubbed TA-NATALSTATUS that‚Äôs targeting exposed Redis servers to deliver cryptocurrency miners. The attack essentially involves scanning for unauthenticated Redis servers on port 6379, followed by issuing legitimate CONFIG, SET, and SAVE commands to execute a malicious cron job that‚Äôs designed to run a shell script that disables SELinux, performs defense evasion steps, block external connections to the Redis port in order to prevent rival actors from using the initial access pathway to get in, and terminate competing mining processes (e.g., Kinsing). Also deployed are scripts to install tools like masscan or pnscan, and then launching commands like ‚Äúmasscan ‚Äìshard‚Äù to scan the internet for susceptible Redis instances.</p>

<p>The last step involves setting up persistence via an hourly cron job and kicking off the mining process. Cybersecurity firm CloudSEK said the activity is an evolution of an attack campaign
disclosed by Trend Micro
in April 2020, packing in new features to accommodate rootkit-like features to hide malicious processes and alter the timestamps of their files to fool forensic analysis. ‚ÄúBy renaming system binaries like ps and top to ps.original and replacing them with malicious wrappers, they filter their own malware (httpgd) out of the output. An admin looking for the miner won‚Äôt see it using standard tools,‚Äù researcher Abhishek Mathew
said
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThey rename curl and wget to cd1 and wd1. This is a simple but brilliant method to bypass security products that monitor for malicious downloads specifically initiated by these common tool names.‚Äù

<h2 id="linux-malware-delivered-via-malicious-rar-filenames-evades-antivirus-detection"><a id="article-9"></a>Linux Malware Delivered via Malicious RAR Filenames Evades Antivirus Detection</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have shed light on a novel attack chain that employs phishing emails to deliver an open-source backdoor called
VShell
. The ‚ÄúLinux-specific malware infection chain that starts with a spam email with a malicious RAR archive file,‚Äù Trellix researcher Sagar Bade
said
in a technical write-up. ‚ÄúThe payload isn‚Äôt hidden inside the file content or a macro, it‚Äôs encoded directly in the filename itself. Through clever use of shell command injection and Base64-encoded Bash payloads, the attacker turns a simple file listing operation into an automatic malware execution trigger.‚Äù
The technique, the cybersecurity company added, takes advantage of a simple yet dangerous pattern commonly observed in shell scripts that arises when file names are evaluated with inadequate sanitization, thereby causing a trivial command like eval or echo to facilitate the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>What‚Äôs more, the technique offers the added advantage of getting around traditional defenses, as antivirus engines don‚Äôt typically scan file names. The starting point of the attack is an email message containing a RAR archive, which includes a file with a maliciously crafted file name: ‚Äúziliao2.pdf<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{echo,&lt;Base64-encoded command&gt;}|{base64,-d}|bash</code>‚Äù
Specifically, the file name incorporates Bash-compatible code that‚Äôs engineered to execute commands when it‚Äôs interpreted by the shell. It‚Äôs worth noting that simply extracting the file from the archive does not trigger execution. Rather, it occurs only when a shell script or command attempts to parse the file name.</p>

<p>Another important aspect to consider here is that it‚Äôs not possible to manually create a file name with this syntax, meaning it was likely created using another language or dropped using an external tool or script that bypasses shell input validation, Trellix said. This, in turn, leads to the execution of an embedded Base64-encoded downloader, which then retrieves from an external server an ELF binary for the appropriate system architecture (x86_64, i386, i686, armv7l, or aarch64). The binary, for its part, initiates communication with a command-and-control (C2) server to obtain the encrypted VShell payload, decode, and execute it on the host. Trellix said the phishing emails are disguised as an invitation for a beauty product survey, luring recipients with a monetary reward (10 RMB) for completing it.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCrucially, the email includes a RAR archive attachment (‚Äòyy.rar‚Äô), even though it doesn‚Äôt explicitly instruct the user to open or extract it,‚Äù Bade explained. ‚ÄúThe social engineering angle is subtle: The user is distracted by the survey content, and the presence of the attachment might be mistaken for a survey-related document or data file.‚Äù
VShell is a Go-based remote access tool that has been widely put to use by Chinese hacking groups in recent years, including
UNC5174
, supporting reverse shell, file operations, process management, port forwarding, and encrypted C2 communications. What makes this attack dangerous is that the malware operates entirely in-memory, avoiding disk-based detection, not to mention it can target a wide range of Linux devices. ‚ÄúThis analysis highlights a dangerous evolution in Linux malware delivery where a simple file name embedded in a RAR archive can be weaponized to execute arbitrary commands,‚Äù Trellix said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe infection chain exploits command injection in shell loops, abuses Linux‚Äôs permissive execution environment, and ultimately delivers a powerful backdoor VShell malware capable of full remote control over the system.‚Äù
The development comes as Picus Security released a technical analysis of a Linux-focused post-exploit tool dubbed RingReaper that leverages the Linux kernel‚Äôs
io_uring framework
to circumvent traditional monitoring tools. It‚Äôs currently not known who is behind the malware. ‚ÄúInstead of invoking standard functions such as read, write, recv, send, or connect, RingReaper employs io_uringprimitives (e.g., io_uring_prep_*) to execute equivalent operations asynchronously,‚Äù security researcher Sƒ±la √ñzeren Hacƒ±oƒülu
said
. ‚ÄúThis method helps bypass hook-based detection mechanisms and reduces the visibility of malicious activity in telemetry commonly gathered by EDR platforms.‚Äù
RingReaper makes use of
io_uring
to enumerate system processes, active pseudo-terminal (PTS) sessions, network connections, and logged-in users, while reducing its footprint and avoiding detection.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs also capable of collecting user information from the ‚Äú/etc/passwd‚Äù file, abusing SUID binaries for privilege escalation, and erasing traces of itself after execution. ‚ÄúIt exploits the Linux kernel‚Äôs modern asynchronous I/O interface, io_uring, to minimize reliance on conventional system calls that security tools frequently monitor or hook,‚Äù Picus said.

<h2 id="chinese-hackers-murky-genesis-and-glacial-panda-escalate-cloud-and-telecom-espionage"><a id="article-10"></a>Chinese Hackers Murky, Genesis, and Glacial Panda Escalate Cloud and Telecom Espionage</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers are calling attention to malicious activity orchestrated by a China-nexus cyber espionage group known as
Murky Panda
that involves abusing trusted relationships in the cloud to breach enterprise networks. ‚ÄúThe adversary has also shown considerable ability to quickly weaponize N-day and zero-day vulnerabilities and frequently achieves initial access to their targets by exploiting internet-facing appliances,‚Äù CrowdStrike
said
in a Thursday report. Murky Panda, also known as
Silk Typhoon
(formerly Hafnium), is best known for its
zero-day exploitation of Microsoft Exchange Server flaws
in 2021. Attacks mounted by the hacking group have targeted government, technology, academic, legal, and professional services entities in North America.</p>

<p>Earlier this March, Microsoft
detailed
the threat actor‚Äôs shift in tactics, detailing its targeting of the information technology (IT) supply chain as a means to obtain initial access to corporate networks. It‚Äôs assessed that Murky Panda‚Äôs operations are driven by intelligence gathering. Like other Chinese hacking groups, Murky Panda has exploited internet-facing appliances to obtain initial access and is believed to have also compromised small office/home office (SOHO) devices that are geolocated in the targeted country as an exit node to hinder detection efforts. Other infection pathways include exploitation of known security flaws in Citrix NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway (
CVE-2023-3519
) and Commvault (
CVE-2025-3928
).</p>

<p>The initial access is leveraged to deploy web shells like
neo-reGeorg
to establish persistence and ultimately drop a custom malware called CloudedHope. A 64-bit ELF binary and written in Golang, CloudedHope functions as a basic remote access tool (RAT) while employing anti-analysis and operational security (OPSEC) measures, such as modifying timestamps and deleting indicators of their presence in victim environments to fly under the radar. But a notable aspect of Murky Panda‚Äôs tradecraft concerns the abuse of trusted relationships between partner organizations and their cloud tenants, exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities to breach software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers‚Äô cloud environments and conduct lateral movement to downstream victims. In at least one instance observed in late 2024, the threat actor is said to have compromised a supplier of a North American entity and used the supplier‚Äôs administrative access to the victim entity‚Äôs Entra ID tenant to add a temporary backdoor Entra ID account.</p>

<p>‚ÄúUsing this account, the threat actor then backdoored several preexisting Entra ID service principles related to Active Directory management and emails,‚Äù CrowdStrike said. ‚ÄúThe adversary‚Äôs goals appear targeted in nature based on their focus on accessing emails.‚Äù
From Murky to Genesis
Another China-linked threat actor that has proven skilful at manipulating cloud services is
Genesis Panda
, which has been observed using the infrastructure for basic exfiltration and targeting cloud service provider (CSP) accounts to expand access and establish fallback persistent mechanisms. Active since at least January 2024, Genesis Panda has been attributed to high-volume operations targeting the financial services, media, telecommunications, and technology sectors spanning 11 countries. The goal of the attacks is to enable access for future intelligence-collection activity.</p>

<p>The possibility that it acts as an initial access broker stems from the group‚Äôs exploitation of a wide range of web-facing vulnerabilities and limited data exfiltration. ‚ÄúAlthough Genesis Panda targets a variety of systems, they show consistent interest in compromising cloud-hosted systems to leverage the cloud control plane for lateral movement, persistence, and enumeration,‚Äù CrowdStrike
said
. The adversary has observed ‚Äúconsistently‚Äù querying the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) associated with a cloud-hosted server to obtain credentials for the cloud control plane and enumerate network and general instance configurations. It‚Äôs also known to use credentials, likely obtained from compromised virtual machines (VMs), to burrow deeper into the target‚Äôs cloud account.</p>

<p>The findings illustrate how Chinese hacking groups are becoming increasingly adept at breaking and navigating cloud environments, while also prioritizing stealth and persistence to ensure sustained access and covert data harvesting. Glacial Panda Strikes Telecom Sector
The
telecommunications sector
, per CrowdStrike, has witnessed a 130% increase in
nation-state activity
over the
past year
, primarily driven by the fact they are a treasure trove of intelligence. The latest threat actor to train its sights on the industry vertical is a Chinese threat actor dubbed
Glacial Panda
. The geographic footprint of the hacking group spans Afghanistan, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Panama, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United States.</p>

<p>‚ÄúGlacial Panda highly likely conducts targeted intrusions for intelligence collection purposes, accessing and exfiltrating call detail records and related communications telemetry from multiple telecommunications organizations,‚Äù the cybersecurity company said. ‚ÄúThe adversary primarily targets Linux systems typical in the telecommunications industry, including legacy operating system distributions that support older telecommunications technologies.‚Äù
Attack chains implemented by the threat actor make use of known security vulnerabilities or weak passwords aimed at internet-facing and unmanaged servers, with follow-on activities leveraging privilege escalation bugs like
CVE-2016-5195
(aka Dirty COW) and
CVE-2021-4034
(aka PwnKit). Besides relying on living-off-the-land (LotL) techniques, Glacial Panda‚Äôs intrusions pave the way for the deployment of trojanized OpenSSH components, collectively codenamed ShieldSlide, to gather user authentication sessions and credentials. ‚ÄúThe ShieldSlide-trojanized SSH server binary also provides backdoor access, authenticating any account (including root) when a hardcoded password is entered,‚Äù CrowdStrike said.</p>

<h2 id="automation-is-redefining-pentest-delivery"><a id="article-11"></a>Automation Is Redefining Pentest Delivery</h2>

<p>Pentesting remains one of the most effective ways to identify real-world security weaknesses before adversaries do. But as the threat landscape has evolved, the way we deliver pentest results hasn‚Äôt kept pace. Most organizations still rely on traditional reporting methods‚Äîstatic PDFs, emailed documents, and spreadsheet-based tracking. The problem?</p>

<p>These outdated workflows introduce delays, create inefficiencies, and undermine the value of the work. Security teams need faster insights, tighter handoffs, and clearer paths to remediation. That‚Äôs where automated delivery comes in. Platforms like
PlexTrac
automate pentest finding delivery in real time through robust, rules-based workflows.</p>

<p>(No waiting for the final report!)
The Static Delivery Problem in a Dynamic World
Delivering a pentest report solely as a static document might have made sense a decade ago, but today it‚Äôs a bottleneck. Findings are buried in long documents that don‚Äôt align with how teams operate day-to-day. After receiving the report, stakeholders must manually extract findings, create tickets in platforms like Jira or ServiceNow, and coordinate remediation tracking through disconnected workflows. By the time remediation begins, days or weeks may have passed since the issues were discovered.</p>

<p>Why Automation Matters Now
As organizations adopt Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) and expand the frequency of offensive testing, the volume of findings rapidly grows. Without automation, teams struggle to keep up. Automating delivery helps cut through the noise and deliver results in real time for faster handoffs and visibility across the entire vulnerability lifecycle. Benefits of automating pentest delivery include:
Real-time actionability:
Act on findings immediately, not after the report is finalized
Faster response:
Accelerate remediation, retesting and validation
Standardized operations:
Ensure every finding follows a consistent process
Less manual work:
Free teams to focus on strategic initiatives
Improved focus:
Keep teams focused on what matters
Service providers gain a competitive advantage by automating delivery and integrating directly into client workflows, making themselves an indispensable partner to drive client value.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>For enterprises, it‚Äôs a fast track to operational maturity and a measurable reduction in mean time to remediation (MTTR). 5 Key Components of Automated Pentest Delivery</dt>
  <dt>Centralized data ingestion</dt>
  <dd>Start by consolidating all findings‚Äîmanual and automated‚Äîinto a single source of truth. This includes outputs from scanners (like Tenable, Qualys, Wiz, Snyk) as well as manual pentest findings. Without centralization, vulnerability management becomes a patchwork of disconnected tools and manual processes.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Automated real-time delivery:
As findings are identified, they should be automatically routed to the right people and workflows without waiting for the full report. Predefined rulesets should trigger triage, ticketing, and tracking to allow remediation to begin while testing is still in progress. Automated routing &amp; ticketing:
Standardize routing by defining rules based on severity, asset ownership, and exploitability. Automation can assign findings, generate tickets in tools like Jira or ServiceNow, notify stakeholders through Slack or email, and close out informational issues to ensure findings are automatically routed to the right teams and systems.</p>

<p>Standardized remediation workflows:
Every finding from your centralized data should follow the same lifecycle from triage to closure based on the criteria you‚Äôve set, regardless of source. Whether it‚Äôs discovered from a scanner or manual testing, the process from triage to fix should be consistent and traceable. Triggered retesting &amp; validation:
When a finding is marked as resolved, automation should trigger the appropriate retesting or validation workflow. This ensures nothing slips through the cracks and keeps communication between security and IT teams coordinated and closed-loop.</p>

<p>PlexTrac supports each of these capabilities through its Workflow Automation Engine, helping teams unify and accelerate delivery, remediation, and closure in one platform. Avoid Common Pitfalls
Automation is about more than just speed. It‚Äôs about building standardized, scalable systems. However, if not implemented thoughtfully, it can create new problems.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Watch out for:</dt>
  <dt>Overcomplicating early efforts</dt>
  <dd>Trying to automate everything at once can stall momentum. Start small and focus on a few repeatable workflows first. Add complexity over time and expand as you validate success. Treating automation as a one-time setup</dd>
  <dd>Your workflows should evolve alongside your tools, team structure, and priorities.</dd>
  <dt>Failing to iterate leads to stale processes that no longer align with how teams operate. Automating without clearly defined workflows:</dt>
  <dt>Jumping into automation without first mapping out your current workflows often leads to chaos. Without clear rules for routing, ownership, and escalation, automation may create more problems than it solves. How to get started</dt>
  <dt>Here‚Äôs how to begin automating pentest delivery:</dt>
  <dt>Map your current workflow</dt>
  <dd>Document how findings are delivered, triaged, assigned, and tracked today.</dd>
  <dt>Identify friction points</dt>
  <dd>Look for repetitive tasks, handoff delays, and areas where communication breaks down. Start small
:
Automate one or two high-impact steps first
, like ticket creation, email alerts, or finding delivery. Add complexity over time as you validate what‚Äôs working well and use early results to evolve workflows, add rules, and further streamline. Choose the right platform</dd>
  <dd>Look for solutions that integrate with your existing tools and provide visibility across the vulnerability lifecycle.</dd>
  <dt>Measure impact</dt>
  <dd>Track metrics like MTTR, handoff delays, and retest completion to show the value of your efforts. The Future of Pentest Delivery
Security teams are shifting from reactive testing to proactive exposure management. Pentest delivery automation is a key part of that evolution to help teams move faster, collaborate better, and reduce risk more effectively. For Service Providers, this is a chance to differentiate services, scale operations, and deliver more value with less overhead.</dd>
</dl>

<p>For Enterprise teams, it means driving maturity, demonstrating progress, and staying ahead of emerging threats. Conclusion
Pentesting is too important to be stuck in static reports and manual workflows. By automating delivery, routing, and remediation tracking, organizations can unlock the full value of their offensive security efforts by making findings more actionable, standardizing remediation workflows, and delivering measurable outcomes. Whether you‚Äôre delivering tests to clients or to an internal team, the message is clear: The future of pentest delivery is automated.</p>

<p>INTERPOL on Friday announced that authorities from 18 countries across Africa have arrested 1,209 cybercriminals who targeted 88,000 victims. ‚ÄúThe crackdown recovered $97.4 million and dismantled 11,432 malicious infrastructures, underscoring the global reach of cybercrime and the urgent need for cross-border cooperation,‚Äù the agency
said
. The effort is the second phase of an ongoing law enforcement initiative called
Operation Serengeti
, which took place between June and August 2025 to tackle severe crimes like ransomware, online scams. and business email compromise (BEC).</p>

<p>The first wave of arrests occurred late last year. Among the highlights are the dismantling of 25 cryptocurrency mining centres in Angola, where 60 Chinese nationals were involved in the illicit money-making scheme. ‚ÄúThe crackdown identified 45 illicit power stations which were confiscated, along with mining and IT equipment worth more than $37 million, now earmarked by the government to support power distribution in vulnerable areas,‚Äù INTERPOL said. Elsewhere, Zambian authorities have taken down a large-scale online investment fraud operation that claimed 65,000 victims who lost around $300 million after they were lured into investing in cryptocurrency through advertising campaigns that promised high-yield returns.</p>

<p>Fifteen individuals have been arrested in connection with the scheme, with officials seizing domains, mobile numbers, and bank accounts for further investigation. Also disrupted in the southern African country is a scam center and a suspected human trafficking network. Lastly, law enforcement also tore down a transnational inheritance scam originating in Germany, arresting the primary suspect and confiscating electronics, jewellery, cash, and vehicles. The scam is estimated to have caused losses of around $1.6 million.</p>

<p>‚ÄúEach INTERPOL-coordinated operation builds on the last, deepening cooperation, increasing information sharing and developing investigative skills across member countries,‚Äù Valdecy Urquiza, secretary general of INTERPOL, said. ‚ÄúWith more contributions and shared expertise, the results keep growing in scale and impact. This global network is stronger than ever, delivering real outcomes and safeguarding victims.‚Äù
Singapore-headquartered Group-IB said it provided ‚Äúcircumstantial intelligence‚Äù on a cryptocurrency investment scam, along with infrastructural details associated with the scam and other BEC campaigns across the African region. ‚ÄúCybercrime recognizes no borders, and its impact is truly global,‚Äù Dmitry Volkov, Group-IB CEO,
said
