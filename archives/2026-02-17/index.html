<h2 id="infostealer-steals-openclaw-ai-agent-configuration-files-and-gateway-tokens"><a id="article-1"></a>Infostealer Steals OpenClaw AI Agent Configuration Files and Gateway Tokens</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers disclosed they have detected a case of an information stealer infection successfully exfiltrating a victim’s
OpenClaw
(formerly Clawdbot and Moltbot) configuration environment. “This finding marks a significant milestone in the evolution of infostealer behavior: the transition from stealing browser credentials to harvesting the ‘souls’ and identities of personal AI [artificial intelligence] agents,” Hudson Rock
said
. Alon Gal, CTO of Hudson Rock, told The Hacker News that the stealer was likely a variant of Vidar based on the infection details. Vidar is an off-the-shelf information stealer that’s known to be active since late 2018.</p>

<p>That said, the cybersecurity company said the data capture was not facilitated by a custom OpenClaw module within the stealer malware, but rather through a “broad file-grabbing routine” that’s designed to look for certain file extensions and specific directory names containing sensitive data. This included the following files -
openclaw.json, which contains details related to the
OpenClaw gateway token
, along with the victim’s redacted email address and workspace path. device.json, which contains cryptographic keys for secure pairing and signing operations within the OpenClaw ecosystem. soul.md
, which contains details of the agent’s core operational principles, behavioral guidelines, and ethical boundaries.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that the theft of the gateway authentication token can allow an attacker to connect to the victim’s local OpenClaw instance remotely if the port is exposed, or even masquerade as the client in authenticated requests to the AI gateway. “While the malware may have been looking for standard ‘secrets,’ it inadvertently struck gold by capturing the entire operational context of the user’s AI assistant,” Hudson Rock added. “As AI agents like OpenClaw become more integrated into professional workflows, infostealer developers will likely release dedicated modules specifically designed to decrypt and parse these files, much like they do for Chrome or Telegram today.”
The disclosure comes as
security issues
with OpenClaw prompted the maintainers of the open-source agentic platform to
announce
a partnership with VirusTotal to scan for malicious skills uploaded to ClawHub, establish a threat model, and add the ability to
audit for potential misconfigurations
. Last week, the OpenSourceMalware team detailed an ongoing ClawHub malicious skills campaign that uses a new technique to bypass VirusTotal scanning by hosting the malware on lookalike OpenClaw websites and using the skills purely as decoys, instead of embedding the payload directly in their SKILL.md files.</p>

<p>“The shift from embedded payloads to external malware hosting shows threat actors adapting to detection capabilities,” security researcher Paul McCarty
said
. “As AI skill registries grow, they become increasingly attractive targets for supply chain attacks.”
Another
security problem
highlighted by OX Security concerns
Moltbook
, a Reddit-like internet forum designed exclusively for artificial intelligence agents, mainly those running on OpenClaw. The research found that an AI Agent account, once created on Moltbook, cannot be deleted. This means that users who wish to delete the accounts and remove the associated data have no recourse.</p>

<p>What’s more, an analysis published by SecurityScorecard’s STRIKE Threat Intelligence team has also found
hundreds of thousands of exposed OpenClaw instances
, likely exposing users to remote code execution (RCE) risks. Fake OpenClaw Website Serving Malware
“RCE vulnerabilities allow an attacker to send a malicious request to a service and execute arbitrary code on the underlying system,” the cybersecurity company
said
. “When OpenClaw runs with permissions to email, APIs, cloud services, or internal resources, an RCE vulnerability can become a pivot point. A bad actor does not need to break into multiple systems.</p>

<p>They need one exposed service that already has authority to act.”
OpenClaw has had a viral surge in interest since it first debuted in November 2025. As of writing, the open-source project has
more than 200,000 stars
on GitHub. On February 15, 2026, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman
said
OpenClaw’s founder, Peter Steinberger, would be joining the AI company, adding, “OpenClaw will live in a foundation as an open source project that OpenAI will continue to support.”

<h2 id="study-uncovers-25-password-recovery-attacks-in-major-cloud-password-managers"><a id="article-2"></a>Study Uncovers 25 Password Recovery Attacks in Major Cloud Password Managers</h2>

<p>A new study has
found
that multiple cloud-based password managers, including Bitwarden, Dashlane, and LastPass, are susceptible to password recovery attacks under certain conditions. “The attacks range in severity from integrity violations to the complete compromise of all vaults in an organization,” researchers Matteo Scarlata, Giovanni Torrisi, Matilda Backendal, and Kenneth G. Paterson
said
. “The majority of the attacks allow the recovery of passwords.”
It’s worth noting that the threat actor, per the study from ETH Zurich and Università della Svizzera italiana, supposes a malicious server and aims to examine the password manager’s zero-knowledge encryption (ZKE) promises made by the three solutions.</p>

<p>ZKE is a cryptographic technique that allows one party to prove knowledge of a secret to another party without actually revealing the secret itself. ZKE is also a little different from end-to-end encryption (E2EE). While E2EE refers to a method of securing data in transit, ZKE is mainly about storing data in an encrypted format such that only the person with the key can access that information. Password manager vendors are known to implement ZKE to “enhance” user privacy and security by ensuring that the vault data cannot be tampered with.</p>

<p>However, the latest research has uncovered 12 distinct attacks against Bitwarden, seven against LastPass, and six against Dashlane, ranging from integrity violations of targeted user vaults to a total compromise of all the vaults associated with an organization. Collectively, these password management solutions serve over 60 million users and nearly 125,000 businesses. “Despite vendors’ attempts to achieve security in this setting, we uncover several common design anti-patterns and cryptographic misconceptions that resulted in vulnerabilities,” the researchers said in an accompanying paper. The attacks fall under four broad categories -
Attacks that exploit the “Key Escrow” account recovery mechanism to compromise the confidentiality guarantees of Bitwarden and LastPass, resulting from vulnerabilities in their key escrow designs.</p>

<p>Attacks that exploit flawed item-level encryption – i.e., encrypting data items and sensitive user settings as separate objects and often combine with unencrypted or unauthenticated metadata, to result in integrity violations, metadata leakage, field swapping, and key derivation function (
KDF
) downgrade. Attacks that exploit sharing features to compromise vault integrity and confidentiality. Attacks that exploit backwards compatibility with legacy code that result in downgrade attacks in Bitwarden and Dashlane. The study also found that 1Password, another popular password manager, is vulnerable to both item-level vault encryption and sharing attacks.</p>

<p>However, 1Password has opted to treat them as arising from already known architectural limitations. Summary of attacks (BW stands for Bitwarden, LP for LastPass, and DL for Dashlane)
When reached for comment, Jacob DePriest, Chief Information Security Officer and Chief Information Officer at 1Password, told The Hacker News that the company’s security reviewed the paper in detail and found no new attack vectors beyond those already documented in its publicly available
Security Design White Paper
. “We are committed to continually strengthening our
security architecture
and evaluating it against advanced threat models, including malicious-server scenarios like those described in the research, and evolving it over time to maintain the protections our users rely on,” DePriest added. “For example, 1Password uses
Secure Remote Password
(SRP) to authenticate users without transmitting encryption keys to our servers, helping mitigate entire classes of server-side attacks.</p>

<p>More recently, we introduced a
new capability
for enterprise-managed credentials, which from the start are created and secured to withstand sophisticated threats.”
As for the rest, Bitwarden, Dashlane, and LastPass have all implemented countermeasures to mitigate the risks highlighted in the research, with LastPass also planning to harden its admin password reset and sharing workflows to counter the threat posed by a malicious intermediary. There is no evidence that any of these issues has been exploited in the wild. Specifically, Dashlane has patched an issue where a successful compromise of its servers could have allowed a downgrade of the encryption model used to generate encryption keys and protect user vaults. The issue was fixed by removing support for legacy cryptography methods with Dashlane Extension
version 6.2544.1
released in November 2025.</p>

<p>“This downgrade could result in the compromise of a weak or easily guessable Master Password, and the compromise of individual ‘downgraded’ vault items,” Dashlane
said
. “This issue was the result of the allowed use of legacy cryptography. This legacy cryptography was supported by Dashlane in certain cases for backwards compatibility and migration flexibility.”
Bitwarden said all identified issues are being addressed. “Seven of which have been resolved or are in active remediation by the Bitwarden team,” it
said
.</p>

<p>“The remaining three issues have been accepted as intentional design decisions necessary for product functionality.”
In a similar advisory, LastPass
said
it’s “actively working to add stronger integrity guarantees to better cryptographically bind items, fields, and metadata, thereby helping to maintain integrity assurance.”

<h2 id="weekly-recap-outlook-add-ins-hijack-0-day-patches-wormable-botnet--ai-malware"><a id="article-3"></a>Weekly Recap: Outlook Add-Ins Hijack, 0-Day Patches, Wormable Botnet &amp; AI Malware</h2>

<p>This week’s recap shows how small gaps are turning into big entry points. Not always through new exploits, often through tools, add-ons, cloud setups, or workflows that people already trust and rarely question. Another signal: attackers are mixing old and new methods. Legacy botnet tactics, modern cloud abuse, AI assistance, and supply-chain exposure are being used side by side, whichever path gives the easiest foothold.</p>

<p>Below is the full weekly recap — a condensed scan of the incidents, flaws, and campaigns shaping the threat landscape right now. ⚡ Threat of the Week
Malicious Outlook Add-in Turns Into Phishing Kit
— In an unusual case of a supply chain attack, the legitimate AgreeTo add-in for Outlook has been hijacked and turned into a phishing kit that stole more than 4,000 Microsoft account credentials. This was made possible by seizing control of a domain associated with the now-abandoned project to serve a fake Microsoft login page. The incident demonstrates how overlooked and abandoned assets turn into attack vectors.</p>

<p>“What makes Office add-ins particularly concerning is the combination of factors: they run inside Outlook, where users handle their most sensitive communications, they can request permissions to read and modify emails, and they’re distributed through Microsoft’s own store, which carries implicit trust,” Koi Security’s Idan Dardikman said. Microsoft has since removed the add-in from its store. Can You Quantify Risk to Your Board? Bridge the gap between technical expertise and board-level strategy.</p>

Google Releases Fixes for Actively Exploited Chrome 0-Day
— Google shipped security updates for its Chrome browser to address a flaw that it said has been exploited in the wild. The high-severity vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-2441 (CVSS score: 8.8), has been described as a use-after-free bug in CSS that could result in arbitrary code execution. Google did not disclose any details about how the vulnerability is being exploited in the wild, by whom, or who may have been targeted, but it acknowledged that “an exploit for CVE-2026-2441 exists in the wild.” CVE-2026-2441 is the first actively exploited Chrome flaw patched by Google this year.</p>

<p>BeyondTrust Flaw Comes Under Active Exploitation
— A newly disclosed critical vulnerability in BeyondTrust Remote Support and Privileged Remote Access products has come under active exploitation in the wild less than 24 hours after the publication of a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit. The vulnerability in question is CVE-2026-1731 (CVS score: 9.9), which could allow an unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution by sending specially crafted requests. According to BeyondTrust, successful exploitation of the shortcoming could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute operating system commands in the context of the site user, resulting in unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and service disruption. Data from GreyNoise revealed that a single IP accounted for 86% of all observed reconnaissance sessions so far.</p>

<p>Apple Ships Patches for Actively Exploited 0-Day
— Apple released iOS, iPadOS, macOS Tahoe, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS updates to address a zero-day flaw that it said has been exploited in sophisticated cyber attacks against specific individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-20700 (CVSS score: 7.8), has been described as a memory corruption issue in dyld, Apple’s Dynamic Link Editor. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker with memory write capability to execute arbitrary code on susceptible devices. Google Threat Analysis Group (TAG) has been credited with discovering and reporting the bug.</p>

<p>The issue has been addressed in iOS 26.3, iPadOS 26.3, macOS Tahoe 26.3, tvOS 26.3, watchOS 26.3, and visionOS 26.3. SSHStalker Uses IRC for C2
— A newly documented Linux botnet named SSHStalker is using the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) communication protocol for command-and-control (C2) operations. The SSHStalker botnet relies on classic IRC mechanics, prioritizing resilience, scale, and low-cost C2 over stealth and technical novelty. The toolkit achieves initial access through automated SSH scanning and brute forcing, using a Go binary that masquerades as the popular open-source network discovery utility nmap.</p>

<p>Compromised hosts are then used to scan for additional SSH targets, allowing it to spread in a worm-like manner. Also dropped to infected hosts are payloads to escalate privileges using a catalog of 15-year-old CVEs, perform AWS key harvesting, and cryptocurrency mining. “What we actually found was a loud, stitched-together botnet kit that mixes old-school IRC control, compiling binaries on hosts, mass SSH compromise, and cron-based persistence,” Flare said, describing it as a “scale-first operation that favors reliability over stealth.”
TeamPCP Turns Cloud Infrastructure into Cybercrime Bots
— A threat cluster known as TeamPCP is systematically targeting misconfigured and exposed cloud native environments to hijack infrastructure, expand its scale, and monetize its operations through cryptocurrency mining, proxyware, data theft, and extortion. TeamPCP’s modus operandi involves scanning broad IP ranges for exposed Docker APIs, Kubernetes clusters, Redis servers, Ray dashboards, and systems susceptible to the React2Shell vulnerability in React Server Components.</p>

<p>Once it gains access to a system, the threat actor deploys malicious Python and Shell scripts that pull down additional payloads to install proxies, tunneling software, and other components that enable persistence even after server reboots. The varied end goals of the operation ensure that TeamPCP has several revenue streams as “every compromised system becomes a scanner, a proxy, a miner, a data exfiltration node, and a launchpad for further attacks,” Flare said. “Kubernetes clusters are not merely breached; they are converted into distributed botnets.”
State-Sponsored Hackers Use AI at All Stages of Attack Cycle
— Google said it found evidence of nation-state hacking groups using its artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot Gemini at nearly every stage of the cyber attack cycle. The findings once again underscore how such tools are being increasingly integrated into malicious operations, even if they don’t equip bad actors with novel capabilities.</p>

<p>One major area of concern with AI abuse is automating the development of vulnerability exploitation, allowing attackers to move faster than the defenders, necessitating that companies respond quickly and fix security weaknesses. Gemini is being weaponized in other ways too, Google said, with some bad actors embedding its APIs directly into malicious code. This includes a new malware family called HONESTCUE that sends prompts to generate working code that the malware compiles and executes in memory. The prompts appear benign in isolation and “devoid of any context related to malware,” allowing them to bypass Gemini’s safety filters.</p>

<p>Nation-State Hackers Go After Defense Industrial Base
— Digital threats targeting the defense industrial base (DIB) sector are expanding beyond traditional espionage into supply chain attacks, workforce infiltration, and cyber operations that lend nations a strategic advantage on the battlefield. The development comes as the cyber domain becomes increasingly intertwined with national defense. Google Threat Intelligence Group said the DIB sector faces a “relentless barrage” of cyber operations conducted by state-sponsored actors and criminal groups. These activities are primarily driven by Chinese, Iranian, North Korean, and Russian threat actors.</p>

<p>This is also complemented by pre-positioning efforts to gain covert access through zero-day vulnerabilities in edge network devices to maintain persistent access for future strategic advantage. “In modern warfare, the front lines are no longer confined to the battlefield; they extend directly into the servers and supply chains of the industry that safeguards the nation,” the tech giant said. ‎️‍🔥 Trending CVEs

DragonForce Ransomware Cartel Detailed
— In a new analysis, S2W detailed the workings of DragonForce, a ransomware group active since December 2023 that operates under a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model and promotes itself as a cartel to expand its influence. The group has carried out attacks against 363 companies from December 2023 to January 2026, while affiliating with LockBit and Qilin.</p>

<p>DragonForce also maintains the RansomBay service to support affiliates with customized payload generation and configuration options. In addition, it is active on several dark web forums, including BreachForums, RAMP, and Exploit to advertise its RaaS operations and recruit pentesters. “DragonForce has been expanding its operational scope through attacks on other groups as well as through cooperative relationships, which is assessed as an effort to strengthen its position within the ransomware ecosystem,” S2W
said
. New Browser Fingerprinting Technique Uses Ad Block Filters
— Aș browser fingerprinting techniques continue to evolve, new research has
found
that country-specific adblock filter lists installed on the browser can be used to de-anonymize VPN users.</p>

<p>The approach has been codenamed
Adbleed
by security researcher Melvin Lammerts. “Users of ad blockers with country-specific filter lists (e.g., EasyList Germany, Liste FR) can be partially de-anonymized even when using a VPN,” the researcher said. “By probing blocked domains unique to each country’s filter list, we can identify which lists are active, revealing the user’s likely country or language. If 20+ out of 30 probed domains are blocked instantly, we conclude that the country’s filter list is active.”
China’s Tianfu Cup Makes a Quiet Return in 2026
— China’s
Tianfu Cup
hacking contest made its return in 2026, and is now being overseen by the government.</p>

<p>Tianfu Cup was launched in 2018 as an alternative to the Zero Day Initiative’s Pwn2Own competition to demonstrate critical vulnerabilities in consumer and enterprise hardware and software, industrial control systems, and automotive products. Tianfu Cup attracted attention in 2021 when participants
earned a total of $1.88 million
for exploits targeting Windows, Ubuntu, iOS, Safari, Google Chrome, Microsoft Exchange, Adobe Reader, Docker, and VMware. While Tianfu Cup skipped 2022, 2024, and 2025, it popped up in 2023 with a focus on domestic products from companies such as Huawei, Xiaomi, Tencent, and Qihoo 360. After a two-year hiatus in 2024 and 2025, Tianfu Cup once again reappeared late last month.</p>

<p>According to
Natto Thoughts
, the hacking competition is now organized by China’s Ministry of Public Security (MPS). With
regulations implemented by China
in 2021 requiring citizens to report zero-day vulnerabilities to the government, it has raised concerns that Chinese nation-state threat actors have been leveraging the law to stockpile zero-days for cyber espionage operations. DoD Employee Indicted for Moonlighting as a Money Mule
— A Department of Defense (DoD) employee, Samuel D. Marcus, has been indicted in the U.S.</p>

<p>for allegedly serving as a money mule and laundering millions of dollars on behalf of Nigerian scammers. Marcus has been charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, six counts of illegal monetary transactions, and one count of money laundering. “From approximately July 2023 to December 2025, while employed as a Logistics Specialist with the Department of Defense, the defendant was in direct and regular contact with a group of Nigeria-based fraudsters, who operated under the aliases ‘Rachel Jude’ and ‘Ned McMurray,’ among others,” the U.S. Justice Department (DoJ)
said
.</p>

<p>“These fraudsters engaged in a variety of wire fraud schemes that targeted victims based in the United States, including romance fraud, cyber fraud, tax fraud, financing fraud, and business email compromise schemes, to which victims lost millions of dollars.” The indictment alleged that the defendant and other money mules conducted a series of financial transactions to convert fraud victim funds deposited into their accounts into cryptocurrency and to move those funds into foreign accounts. If convicted, Marcus faces a maximum possible sentence of 100 years’ imprisonment, three years’ supervised release, and a $2 million fine. Palo Alto Networks Chose Not to tie TGR-STA-1030 to China
— In a
report
published last week, Reuters said Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 opted not to attribute China to a sprawling cyber espionage campaign dubbed
TGR-STA-1030
that it said broke into the networks of at least 70 government and critical infrastructure organizations across 37 countries over the past year. The decision was motivated “over concerns that the cybersecurity company or its clients could face retaliation from Beijing,” the news agency said.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that the campaign exhibits typical hallmarks associated with a typical China-nexus espionage effort, not least because of the use of tools like Behinder, neo-reGeorg, and Godzilla, which have been primarily identified as used by Chinese hacking groups in the past. Trend Micro Details New Threat Actor Taxonomy
— Trend Micro has outlined a new threat attribution framework that applies standardized evidence scoring, relationship mapping, and bias testing to reduce the risk of misattribution. The naming convention includes Earth for espionage, Water for financially motivated operations, Fire for destructive or disruptive actors, Wind for hacktivists, Aether for unknown motivation, and Void for mixed motivation. “Strong attribution comes from weighing evidence correctly,” Trend Micro
said
.</p>

<p>“Not all evidence carries the same weight, and effective attribution depends on separating high-value intelligence from disposable indicators. Attribution confidence comes from signals that persist over time. Quantifying evidence quality through consistent scoring prevents analysts from overvaluing noise or intuition, helps challenge assumptions, and keeps the focus on signals that genuinely strengthen the overall attribution case rather than isolated data points that do not move it forward.”
Cryptocurrency Flows to Suspected Human Trafficking Services Surge
— Cryptocurrency flows to suspected human trafficking services, largely based in Southeast Asia, grew 85% in 2025, reaching a scale of hundreds of millions across identified services. “This surge in cryptocurrency flows to suspected human trafficking services is not happening in isolation, but is closely aligned with the growth of Southeast Asia–based scam compounds, online casinos and gambling sites, and Chinese-language money laundering (CMLN) and guarantee networks operating largely via Telegram, all of which form a rapidly expanding local illicit ecosystem with global reach and impact,” Chainalysis
said
.</p>

<p>Security Flaw in Munge
— A high-severity vulnerability has been disclosed in Munge that could allow a local attacker to leak cryptographic key material from process memory, and use it to forge arbitrary Munge credentials to impersonate any user, including root, to services that rely on it for authentication. Munge is an authentication service for creating and validating user credentials that’s designed for use in high-performance computing (HPC) cluster environments. The vulnerability, tracked as
CVE-2026-25506
(CVSS score: 7.7), has been present in the codebase for approximately 20 years, per Lexfo. It affects every version up to 0.5.17, and has been addressed in
version 0.5.18
, released on February 10, 2026.</p>

<p>“This vulnerability can be exploited locally to leak the Munge secret key, allowing an attacker to forge arbitrary Munge tokens, valid across the cluster,” Lexfo
said
. “In a way, this is a local privilege escalation in the context of high-performance computers.”
New Campaign Distributes Lumma Stealer and Trojanized Chromium-Based Ninja Browser
— A large-scale malware campaign has been exploiting trusted Google services, including Google Groups, Google Docs, and Google Drive, to distribute Lumma Stealer and a trojanized Chromium-based Ninja Browser on Windows and Linux systems. The attack chain involves the threat actor embedding malicious download links disguised as software updates, often using URL shorteners, in Google Groups to trick users into installing malware. Central to the attack is the abuse of the inherent trust associated with Google-hosted platforms to bypass conventional security controls and increase the likelihood of successful compromise.</p>

<p>“The operation leverages more than 4,000 malicious Google Groups and 3,500 Google-hosted URLs to embed deceptive download links within legitimate-looking discussions, targeting organizations worldwide,” CTM360
said
. “The campaign dynamically redirects victims based on the operating system, delivering an oversized, obfuscated Lumma payload to Windows users and a persistence-enabled malicious browser to Linux systems.”
Disney Agrees to $2.75M Fine for Data Privacy Violations
— Walt Disney has agreed to a $2.75 million fine with the U.S. state of California in response to allegations that it broke the state’s privacy law, the California Consumer Protection Act, by making it difficult for consumers to opt out of having their data shared and sold. The company has also agreed to implement opt-out methods that fully stop Disney’s sale or sharing of consumers’ personal information.</p>

<p>“Consumers shouldn’t have to go to infinity and beyond to assert their privacy rights,”
said
California Attorney General Rob Bonta. “California’s nation-leading privacy law is clear: A consumer’s opt-out right applies wherever and however a business sells data — businesses can’t force people to go device-by-device or service-by-service. In California, asking a business to stop selling your data should not be complicated or cumbersome. My office is committed to the continued enforcement of this critical privacy law.”
Leaked Credentials Exposed Airport Systems to Security Risks
— CloudSEK said it discovered login credentials for a European fourth-party airport service portal being circulated on underground forums, potentially allowing threat actors unauthorized access to an unnamed vendor’s Next Generation Operations Support System (NGOSS) systems at approximately 200 airports across multiple countries.</p>

<p>“The portal, which served as the central control panel for over 200 client airports, lacked Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA),” CloudSEK
said
. “No breach occurred — but the potential for one was immediate and severe.”
🔧 Cybersecurity Tools
SCAM
(Security Comprehension Awareness Measure) — It is a benchmark by 1Password that tests how safely AI agents handle sensitive information in real workplace situations. Instead of asking agents to identify obvious scams, it places them inside everyday tasks—email, credentials, web forms—where hidden threats like phishing links and fake domains appear naturally. The goal is to measure whether AI can recognize, avoid, and report risks before damage happens.</p>

<p>Quantickle
— It is a browser-based graph visualization tool designed to help analysts map and explore threat intelligence data. It turns complex relationships—IPs, domains, malware, actors—into interactive network graphs, making patterns, connections, and attack paths easier to see, investigate, and explain. Disclaimer: These tools are provided for research and educational use only. They are not security-audited and may cause harm if misused.</p>

<p>Review the code, test in controlled environments, and comply with all applicable laws and policies. Conclusion
Taken together, these incidents show how threat activity is spreading across every layer. User tools, enterprise software, cloud infrastructure, and national systems are all in scope. The entry points differ, but the objective stays the same: gain access quietly, then scale impact over time.</p>

<h2 id="safe-and-inclusive-esociety-how-lithuania-is-bracing-for-aidriven-cyber-fraud"><a id="article-4"></a>Safe and Inclusive E‑Society: How Lithuania Is Bracing for AI‑Driven Cyber Fraud</h2>

<p>Presentation of the KTU Consortium Mission ‘A Safe and Inclusive Digital Society’ at the Innovation Agency event ‘Innovation Breakfast: How Mission-Oriented Science and Innovation Programmes Will Address Societal Challenges’. Technologies are evolving fast, reshaping economies, governance, and daily life. Yet, as innovation accelerates, so do digital risks. Technological change is no longer abstract for such a country as Lithuania, as well.</p>

<p>From e-signatures to digital health records, the country depends on secure systems. Cybersecurity has become not only a technical challenge but a societal one – demanding the cooperation of scientists, business leaders, and policymakers. In Lithuania, this cooperation has taken a concrete form – the government-funded
national initiative
. Coordinated by the Innovation Agency Lithuania, the project aims to strengthen the country’s e-security and digital resilience.</p>

<p>Under this umbrella, universities and companies with long-standing expertise are working hand in hand to transform scientific knowledge into market-ready, high-value innovations. Several of these solutions are already being tested in real environments, for example, in public institutions and critical infrastructure operators. As Martynas Survilas, Director of the Innovation Development Department at the Innovation Agency Lithuania, explains:
“Our goal is to turn Lithuania’s scientific potential into real impact – solutions that protect citizens, reinforce trust in digital services, and help build an inclusive, innovative economy. The era of isolated research is over.</p>

<p>In practice, science and business must work together to keep pace with complex, multilayered threats.”
A National Mission: Safe and Inclusive E-Society
Among three strategic national missions launched under this program, one stands out for its relevance to the global digital landscape: “Safe and Inclusive E-Society”, coordinated by
Kaunas University of Technology
(KTU). The mission aims to increase cyber resilience and reduce the risks of personal data breaches, with a focus on everyday users of public and private e-services, contributing directly to Lithuania’s transformation into a secure, digitally empowered society. Its total value exceeds €24.1 million. The KTU consortium includes top Lithuanian universities – Vilnius Tech and Mykolas Romeris University – as well as leading cybersecurity companies such as NRD Cyber Security, Elsis PRO, Transcendent Group Baltics, and the Baltic Institute of Advanced Technology, together with industry association Infobalt and the Lithuanian Cybercrime Competence, Research and Education Center.</p>

<p>The mission’s research and development efforts cover a broad spectrum of cybersecurity challenges that define today’s digital landscape. Teams are developing smart, adaptive, and self-learning buildings. In the financial sector, new AI-driven defense systems are being built to protect FinTech companies and their users from fraud and data breaches. Industrial safety is strengthened through prototypes of threat-detection sensors for critical infrastructure, while hybrid threat management systems are being tailored for use in public safety, education, and business environments.</p>

<p>Other research focuses on combating disinformation through AI models that automatically detect coordinated bot and troll activity, as well as on creating intelligent platforms for automated cyber threat intelligence and real-time analysis. AI Fraud: A New Kind of Threat
According to Dr. Rasa Brūzgienė, Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Sciences at Kaunas University of Technology, the emergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has fundamentally changed the logic of fraud against e-government services. “Until now, the main defense relied on pattern-based detection – for example, automated filters and firewalls could recognize recurring fraud patterns, typical phrases or structures,” she explains.</p>

<p>“However, GenAI has eliminated that ‘pattern’ boundary. Today, criminals can use generative models to create contextually accurate messages. Models know how to write without grammatical errors, use precise terminology, and even replicate the communication style of institutions. This means that modern phishing emails no longer resemble ‘classic fraud’ but become difficult to recognize even for humans, let alone automated filters.”
She emphasizes that both the scale and the quality of attacks have evolved: “The scale has increased because GenAI allows for the automated generation of thousands of different, non-repeating fraudulent messages.</p>

<p>The quality has increased because these messages are personalized, multilingual, and often based on publicly available information about the victim. The result: traditional firewalls and spam filters lose their effectiveness because their detectors can no longer rely on formal features of words, phrases, or structure. The main change is no longer mass scale, but realism. In other words, modern attacks don’t look like fraud – they look like normal legal communication.”
Criminals today, Dr.</p>

<p>Brūzgienė warns, have access to a broad arsenal of AI tools. They use models such as GPT-4, GPT-5, Claude, and open-source alternatives like Llama, Falcon, and Mistral – as well as darker variants such as FraudGPT, WormGPT, or GhostGPT, specifically designed for malicious activities. “They can clone voices using ElevenLabs or Microsoft’s VALL-E from just a few seconds of someone speaking. For creating fake faces and videos, they use StyleGAN, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and DeepFaceLab, along with lip-sync solutions like Wav2Lip and First-Order-Motion,” she notes.</p>

<p>Even more concerning, she adds, is how these tools are orchestrated together: “Criminals produce photorealistic face photos, deepfake videos, and document copies with meticulously edited metadata. LLMs generate high-quality, personalized phishing texts and onboarding dialogues, TTS and voice-cloning models recreate a victim’s or employee’s voice, and image generation tools produce ‘liveness’ videos that fool verification systems. Automated AI agents then handle the rest – creating accounts, uploading documents, and responding to challenges. These multimodal chains can bypass both automated and human verification based on trust.”
“The scary part,” Dr.</p>

<p>Brūzgienė concludes, “is how accessible all of this has become. Commercial TTS solutions like ElevenLabs and open-source implementations of VALL-E provide high-quality voice cloning to anyone. Stable Diffusion, DeepFaceLab, and similar tools make it easy to generate photorealistic images or deepfakes quickly. Because of this accessibility, a single operator can create hundreds of convincing, different, yet interconnected fake profiles in a short time.</p>

<p>We are already seeing such cases in attempts to open fake accounts in financial institutions and crypto platforms.”
AI-Powered Social Engineering
Another new frontier is adaptive AI-driven social engineering. Attackers no longer rely on static scripts – they use LLMs that adapt to a victim’s reactions in real time. Bots start with automated reconnaissance, scraping social media, professional directories, and leaked databases to build personalized profiles. Then, the LLM crafts initial messages that mirror a person’s professional tone or institutional language.</p>

<p>If there’s no response, the system automatically switches channels – from email to SMS or Slack – and changes tone from formal to urgent. If a target hesitates, the AI generates plausible reassurance, quoting real internal policies or procedures. In one typical scenario, a “colleague” writes via work email, follows up on LinkedIn, and then calls using a cloned voice – all orchestrated by connected AI tools. Dr.</p>

<p>Brūzgienė describes this as a new stage of cybercrime evolution: “Social engineering has become scalable, intelligent, and deeply personal. Each victim experiences a unique, evolving deception designed to exploit their psychological and behavioral weak points.”
Lithuania’s Cyber Defense Leadership
Lithuania’s digital ecosystem – known for its advanced e-government architecture and centralized electronic identity (eID) systems – faces unique challenges. However, it also demonstrates remarkable progress. The country has risen steadily in international indices, ranking 25th globally in the Chandler Good Government Index (CGGI) and 33rd in the Government AI Readiness Index (2025).</p>

<p>Lithuania’s AI strategy (2021–2030), updated in 2025, has prioritized AI-driven cyber defense, anomaly detection, and resilience-building. The National Cyber Security Centre (NKSC) integrates AI into threat monitoring, reducing ransomware incidents by fivefold between 2023 and 2024. Collaboration with NATO, ENISA, and EU partners further enhances Lithuania’s hybrid defense capabilities. “We see cyber resilience not just as a technical task but as a foundation for democracy and economic growth,” says Survilas.</p>

<p>“Through the safe and inclusive e-society mission, we are not only protecting our digital infrastructure but also empowering citizens to trust and participate in the digital world. AI will inevitably be used for malicious purposes, but we can also use AI to defend. The key is collaboration across sectors and continuous education. This mission is one of the tools helping us turn that idea into concrete projects, pilots, and services for people in Lithuania.”

<h2 id="new-zerodayrat-mobile-spyware-enables-real-time-surveillance-and-data-theft"><a id="article-5"></a>New ZeroDayRAT Mobile Spyware Enables Real-Time Surveillance and Data Theft</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a new mobile spyware platform dubbed
ZeroDayRAT
that’s being advertised on Telegram as a way to grab sensitive data and facilitate real-time surveillance on Android and iOS devices. “The developer runs dedicated channels for sales, customer support, and regular updates, giving buyers a single point of access to a fully operational spyware panel,” Daniel Kelley, security researcher at iVerify,
said
. “The platform goes beyond typical data collection into real-time surveillance and direct financial theft.”
ZeroDayRAT is designed to support Android versions 5 through 16 and iOS versions up to 26. It’s assessed that the malware is distributed via social engineering or fake app marketplaces.</p>

<p>The malicious binaries are generated through a builder that’s provided to buyers along with an online panel that they can set up on their own server. Once the malware infects a device, the operator gets to see all the details, including model, location, operating system, battery status, SIM, carrier details, app usage, notifications, and a preview of recent SMS messages, through a self-hosted panel. This information allows the threat actor to profile the victim and glean more about who they talk to and the apps they use the most. The panel also extracts their current GPS coordinates and plots them on Google Maps, along with the history of all locations they have been to over time, effectively turning it into spyware.</p>

<p>“One of the more problematic panels is the accounts tab,” Kelley added. “Every account registered on the device is enumerated: Google, WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, Telegram, Amazon, Flipkart, PhonePe, Paytm, Spotify, and more, each with its associated username or email.”
Some of the other capabilities of ZeroDayRAT include logging keystrokes, gathering SMS messages – including one-time passwords (OTPs) to defeat two-factor authentication, as well as allowing hands-on operations, such as activating real-time surveillance via live camera streaming and a microphone feed that allows the adversary to remotely monitor a victim. To enable financial theft, the malware incorporates a stealer component that scans for wallet apps like MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Binance, and Coinbase, and substitutes wallet addresses copied to the clipboard to
reroute transactions
to a wallet under the attacker’s control. There also exists a bank stealer module to target online mobile wallet platforms like Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, along with PhonePe, an Indian digital payments application that allows instant money transfers with the Unified Payments Interface (
UPI
), a protocol to facilitate inter-bank peer-to-peer and person-to-merchant transactions.</p>

<p>“Taken together, this is a complete mobile compromise toolkit, the kind that used to require nation-state investment or bespoke exploit development, now sold on Telegram,” Kelley said. “A single buyer gets full access to a target’s location, messages, finances, camera, microphone, and keystrokes from a browser tab. Cross-platform support and active development make it a growing threat to both individuals and organizations.”
The ZeroDayRAT malware is similar to numerous others that have targeted mobile device users, either via phishing or by infiltrating official app marketplaces. Over the past few years, bad actors have
repeatedly
managed to
find various ways
to bypass
security protections
put in place by Apple and Google to trick users into installing malicious apps.</p>

<p>Attacks targeting Apple’s iOS have typically leveraged an
enterprise provisioning capability
that allows organizations to install apps without the need for publishing them to the App Store. By marketing tools that combine spyware, surveillance, and information-stealing capabilities, they further lower the barrier of entry for less skilled hackers. They also highlight the evolving sophistication and persistence of mobile-focused cyber threats. News of the commercial spyware platform coincides with the emergence of various mobile malware and scam campaigns that have come to light in recent weeks -
An
Android remote access trojan (RAT) campaign
has used Hugging Face to host and distribute malicious APK files.</p>

<p>The infection chain begins when users download a seemingly harmless dropper app (e.g., TrustBastion) that, when opened, prompts users to install an update, which causes the app to download the APK file hosted on Hugging Face. The malware then requests
accessibility permissions
and access to other sensitive controls to enable surveillance and credential theft. An Android RAT called
Arsink
has been found to use Google Apps Script for media and file exfiltration to Google Drive, in addition to relying on Firebase and Telegram for C2. The malware, which allows data theft and complete remote control, is distributed via Telegram, Discord, and MediaFire links, while impersonating various popular brands.</p>

<p>Arsink infections have been concentrated in Egypt, Indonesia, Iraq, Yemen, and Türkiye. A document reader app named All Document Reader (package name: com.recursivestd.highlogic.stellargrid) uploaded to the Google Play Store has been
flagged
for acting as an installer for the
Anatsa
(aka TeaBot and Toddler) banking trojan. The app attracted over 50,000 downloads before it was taken down. An Android banking trojan called
deVixor
has been actively targeting Iranian users through phishing websites that impersonate legitimate automotive businesses since October 2025.</p>

<p>Besides harvesting sensitive information, the malware includes a remotely triggered ransomware module capable of locking devices and demanding cryptocurrency payments. It uses Google Firebase for command delivery and Telegram-based bot infrastructure for administration. A malicious campaign codenamed
ShadowRemit
has exploited fake Android apps and pages mimicking Google Play app listings to enable unlicensed cross-border money transfers. These bogus pages have been found to promote unauthorized APKs as trusted remittance services with zero fees and improved exchange rates.</p>

<p>“Victims are instructed to send payments to beneficiary accounts/eWallet endpoints and provide transaction screenshots as proof for verification,” CTM360 said. “This approach can bypass regulated remittance corridors and aligns with mule-account collection patterns.”
An
Android malware campaign
targeting users in India has abused the trust associated with government services and official digital platforms to distribute malicious APK files through WhatsApp, leading to the deployment of malware that can steal data, establish persistent control, and run a cryptocurrency miner. The operators of an
Android trojan and cybercrime tool
called
Triada
have been observed using phishing landing pages disguised as Chrome browser updates to trick users into downloading malicious APK files hosted on GitHub. According to an analysis by Alex, attackers are “actively taking over long-standing, fully verified advertiser accounts to distribute malicious redirects.”
A
WhatApp-oriented scam campaign
has leveraged video calls, in which the threat actor poses as a bank representative or a Meta support and instructs them to share their phone’s screen to address a purported unauthorized charge on their credit card, and install a legitimate remote access app, such as AnyDesk or TeamViewer, to steal sensitive data.</p>

<p>An Android spyware campaign has leveraged romance scam tactics to target individuals in Pakistan to distribute a malicious dating chat app dubbed
GhostChat
to exfiltrate victims’ data. It’s currently not known how the malware is distributed. The threat actors behind the operation are also suspected to be running a ClickFix attack that infects victims’ computers with a DLL payload that can gather system metadata and run commands issued by an external server, as well as a WhatsApp device-linking attack called
GhostPairing
to gain access to their WhatsApp accounts. A new family of Android click fraud trojans called
Phantom
has been found to leverage TensorFlow.js, a JavaScript machine learning library, to automatically detect and interact with specific advertisement elements on a site loaded in a hidden WebView.</p>

<p>An alternative “signaling” mode uses WebRTC to stream a live video feed of the virtual browser screen to the attackers’ server and allow them to click, scroll, or enter text. The malware is distributed via mobile games published to Xiaomi’s GetApps store and other unofficial, third-party app stores. An Android malware family called
NFCShare
has been distributed via a Deutsche Bank phishing campaign to deceive users into installing a malicious APK file (“deutsche.apk”) under the pretext of an update, which reads NFC card data and exfiltrates it to a remote WebSocket endpoint. The malware shares similarities with
NFC relay malware families
like NGate,
ZNFC
, SuperCard X, PhantomCard, and RelayNFC, with its command-and-control (C2) server previously flagged as associated with SuperCard X activity in November 2025.</p>

<p>In a report published last month, Group-IB said it has witnessed a surge in NFC-enabled Android tap-to-pay malware, most of which is advertised within Chinese cybercrime communities on Telegram. The NFC-based relay technique is also referred to as
Ghost Tap
. “At least $355,000 in illegitimate transactions have been recorded from one POS vendor alone throughout November 2024 – August 2025,” the Singapore-headquartered cybersecurity company
said
. “In another observed scenario, mobile wallets preloaded with compromised cards are used by mules across the globe to make purchases.”
Group-IB also said it identified three major vendors of Android NFC relay apps, including TX-NFC, X-NFC, and NFU Pay, with TX-NFC amassing over 25,000 subscribers on Telegram since commencing operations in early January 2025.</p>

<p>X-NFC and NFU Pay have more than 5,000 and 600 subscribers on the messaging platform, respectively. The end goal of these attacks is to trick victims into installing NFC-enabled malware and tapping their physical payment cards on their smartphone, causing the transaction data to be captured and relayed to the cybercriminal’s device through an attacker-controlled server. This is achieved by means of a dedicated app installed on the money mule’s device to complete payments or cash-out as though the victims’ cards were physically present. Calling tap-to-pay scams a growing concern, Group-IB said it observed a steady increase in the detection of malware artifacts between May 2024 and December 2025.</p>

<p>“At the same time, different families and variants are also appearing, while the old ones remain active,” it added. “This indicates the spread of this technology among fraudsters.”

<h2 id="new-chrome-zero-day-cve-2026-2441-under-active-attack--patch-released"><a id="article-6"></a>New Chrome Zero-Day (CVE-2026-2441) Under Active Attack — Patch Released</h2>

<p>Google on Friday released security updates for its Chrome browser to address a security flaw that it said has been exploited in the wild. The high-severity vulnerability, tracked as
CVE-2026-2441
(CVSS score: 8.8), has been described as a use-after-free bug in CSS. Security researcher Shaheen Fazim has been credited with discovering and reporting the shortcoming on February 11, 2026. “Use after free in CSS in Google Chrome prior to 145.0.7632.75 allowed a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code inside a sandbox via a crafted HTML page,” according to a description of the flaw in the NIST’s National Vulnerability Database (NVD).</p>

<p>Google did not disclose any details about how the vulnerability is being exploited in the wild, by whom, or who may have been targeted, but it
acknowledged
that “an exploit for CVE-2026-2441 exists in the wild.”
While Google Chrome is no stranger to actively exploited vulnerabilities, the development once again highlights how browser-based flaws are an attractive target for malicious actors, given that they are installed everywhere and expose a broad attack surface. The disclosure of CVE-2026-2441 makes it the first actively exploited zero-day in Chrome that Google has patched in 2026. Last year, the tech giant
addressed
eight zero-day flaws in Chrome that were either actively exploited or demonstrated as a proof-of-concept (PoC). Last week, Apple also
shipped
iOS, iPadOS, macOS Tahoe, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS updates to address a zero-day flaw (CVE-2026-20700, CVSS score: 7.8) that had been weaponized as a zero-day to execute arbitrary code on susceptible devices as part of an “extremely sophisticated attack” targeting specific individuals who were running iOS versions before iOS 26.</p>

<p>For optimal protection, users are advised to update their Chrome browser to versions 145.0.7632.75/76 for Windows and Apple macOS, and 144.0.7559.75 for Linux. To make sure the latest updates are installed, users can navigate to More &gt; Help &gt; About Google Chrome and select Relaunch. Users of other Chromium-based browsers, such as Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi, are also advised to apply the fixes as and when they become available. Found this article interesting?</p>

<h2 id="microsoft-discloses-dns-based-clickfix-attack-using-nslookup-for-malware-staging"><a id="article-7"></a>Microsoft Discloses DNS-Based ClickFix Attack Using Nslookup for Malware Staging</h2>

<p>Microsoft has
disclosed
details of a new version of the ClickFix social engineering tactic in which the attackers trick unsuspecting users into running commands that carry out a Domain Name System (DNS) lookup to retrieve the next-stage payload. Specifically, the attack relies on using the “
nslookup
“ (short for
nameserver lookup
) command to execute a custom DNS lookup triggered via the Windows Run dialog. ClickFix is an
increasingly popular technique
that’s traditionally delivered via phishing, malvertising, or drive-by download schemes, often redirecting targets to bogus landing pages that host fake CAPTCHA verification or instructions to address a non-existent problem on their computers by running a command either through the Windows Run dialog or the macOS Terminal app. The attack method has become widespread over the past two years since it hinges on the victims infecting their own machines with malware, thereby allowing the threat actors to bypass security controls.</p>

<p>The effectiveness of ClickFix has been such that it has
spawned
several
variants
, such as FileFix, JackFix, ConsentFix, CrashFix, and GlitchFix. “In the latest DNS-based staging using ClickFix, the initial command runs through cmd.exe and performs a DNS lookup against a hard-coded external DNS server, rather than the system’s default resolver,” the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team said in a series of posts on X. “The output is filtered to extract the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Name:</code> DNS response, which is executed as the second-stage payload.”
Microsoft said this new variation of ClickFix uses DNS as a “lightweight staging or signaling channel,” enabling the threat actor to reach infrastructure under their control, as well as erect a new validation layer before executing the second-stage payload. “Using DNS in this way reduces dependency on traditional web requests and can help blend malicious activity into normal network traffic,” the Windows maker added.</p>

<p>The downloaded payload subsequently initiates an attack chain that leads to the download of a ZIP archive from an external server (“azwsappdev[.]com”), from which a malicious Python script is extracted and run to conduct reconnaissance, run discovery commands, and drop a Visual Basic Script (VBScript) responsible for launching ModeloRAT, a Python-based remote access trojan
previously distributed
through CrashFix. To establish persistence, a Windows shortcut (LNK) file pointing to the VBScript is created in the Windows Startup folder so that the malware is automatically launched every time the operating system is started. The disclosure comes as Bitdefender warned of a surge in
Lumma Stealer
activity, driven by ClickFix-style fake CAPTCHA campaigns that deploy an AutoIt-version of
CastleLoader
, a malware loader associated with a threat actor codenamed GrayBravo (formerly TAG-150). CastleLoader incorporates checks to determine the presence of virtualization software and specific security programs before decrypting and launching the stealer malware in memory.</p>

<p>Outside of ClickFix, websites advertising cracked software and pirated movies serve as bait for CastleLoader-based attack chains, deceiving users into downloading rogue installers or executables masquerading as MP4 media files. Other CastleLoader campaigns have also leveraged websites promising cracked software downloads as a starting point to distribute a fake NSIS installer that also runs obfuscated VBA scripts prior to running the AutoIt script that loads Lumma Stealer. The VBA loader is designed to run scheduled tasks responsible for ensuring persistence. “Despite significant
law enforcement disruption efforts
in 2025, Lumma Stealer operations continued, demonstrating resilience by rapidly migrating to new hosting providers and adapting alternative loaders and delivery techniques,” the Romanian cybersecurity company
said
.</p>

<p>“At the core of many of these campaigns is CastleLoader, which plays a central role in helping LummaStealer spread through delivery chains.”
Interestingly, one of the domains on CastleLoader’s infrastructure (“testdomain123123[.]shop”) was flagged as a Lumma Stealer command-and-control (C2), indicating that the operators of the two malware families are either working together or sharing service providers. The majority of Lumma Stealer infections have been recorded in India, followed by France, the U.S., Spain, Germany, Brazil, Mexico, Romania, Italy, and Canada. “The effectiveness of ClickFix lies in its abuse of procedural trust rather than technical vulnerabilities,” Bitdefender said. “The instructions resemble troubleshooting steps or verification workarounds that users may have encountered previously.</p>

<p>As a result, victims often fail to recognize that they are manually executing arbitrary code on their own system.”
CastleLoader is not the only loader that’s being used to distribute Lumma Stealer. Campaigns observed as early as March 2025 have leveraged another loader dubbed
RenEngine Loader
, with the malware propagated under the guise of game cheats and pirated software like CorelDRAW graphics editor. In these attacks, the loader makes way for a secondary loader named Hijack Loader, which then deploys Lumma Stealer. According to
data
from Kaspersky, RenEngine Loader attacks have primarily affected users in Russia, Brazil, Turkey, Spain, Germany, Mexico, Algeria, Egypt, Italy, and France since March 2025.</p>

<p>The developments coincide with the emergence of various campaigns using social engineering lures, including ClickFix, to deliver a variety of stealers and malware loaders -
A macOS campaign that has used phishing and malvertising ploys to deliver Odyssey Stealer, a rebrand of Poseidon Stealer, which itself is a fork of Atomic macOS Stealer (
AMOS
). The stealer exfiltrates credentials and data from 203 browser wallet extensions and 18 desktop wallet applications to facilitate cryptocurrency theft. “Beyond credential theft, Odyssey operates as a full remote access trojan,” Censys
said
. “A persistent LaunchDaemon polls the C2 every 60 seconds for commands, supporting arbitrary shell execution, reinfection, and a SOCKS5 proxy for tunneling traffic through victim machines.”
A
ClickFix attack chain
targeting Windows systems that uses fake CAPTCHA verification pages on legitimate-but-compromised websites to trick users into executing PowerShell commands that deploy the
StealC
information stealer.</p>

<p>An
email phishing campaign
that uses a malicious SVG file contained within a password‑protected ZIP archive to instruct the victim to run a PowerShell command using ClickFix, ultimately resulting in the deployment of an open-source .NET infostealer called
Stealerium
. A campaign that
exploits the public sharing feature
of generative artificial intelligence (AI) services like Anthropic Claude to stage malicious ClickFix instructions on how to perform a variety of tasks on macOS (e.g., “online DNS resolver”), and distribute these links via sponsored results on search engines like Google to deploy Atomic Stealer and
MacSync Stealer
. A campaign that directs users searching for “macOS cli disk space analyzer” to a fake Medium article impersonating Apple’s Support Team to deceive them into running ClickFix instructions that deliver next-stage stealer payloads from an external server “raxelpak[.]com.”
“The C2 domain raxelpak[.]com has URL history going back to 2021, when it appeared to host a safety workwear e-commerce site,” MacPaw’s Moonlock Lab
said
. “Whether the domain was hijacked or simply expired and re-registered by the [threat actor] is unclear, but it fits the broader pattern of leveraging aged domains with existing reputation to avoid detection.”
A variation of the same campaign that stages ClickFix instructions for supposedly installing Homebrew on links associated with Claude and Evernote and distributes them through sponsored results to install stealer malware.</p>

<p>“The ad shows a real, recognized domain (claude.ai), not a spoof or typo-squatted site,” AdGuard
said
. “Clicking the ad leads to a real Claude page, not a phishing copy. The consequence is clear: Google Ads + a well-known trusted platform + technical users with high downstream impact = a potent malware distribution vector.”
A macOS email phishing campaign that prompts recipients to download and run an AppleScript file to address supposed compatibility issues, resulting in the deployment of another AppleScript designed to steal credentials and retrieve additional JavaScript payloads. “The malware does not grant permissions to itself; instead, it forges TCC authorizations for trusted Apple-signed binaries (Terminal, osascript, Script Editor, and bash) and then executes malicious actions through these binaries to inherit their permissions,” Darktrace
said
.</p>

<p>A
ClearFake campaign
that employs
fake CAPTCHA lures
on compromised WordPress sites to trigger the execution of an HTML Application (HTA) file and deploy Lumma Stealer. The campaign is also known to use malicious JavaScript injections to take advantage of a technique known as EtherHiding to execute a contract hosted on the BNB Smart Chain and fetch an unknown payload hosted on GitHub. EtherHiding offers attackers several advantages. It allows malicious traffic to blend with legitimate Web3 activity.</p>

<p>Because blockchain is immutable and decentralized, it also offers increased resilience in the face of takedown efforts. The use of ClickFix techniques to target macOS underlines a broader trend where threat actors are increasingly seeking out machines that run Apple’s operating system to infect them with infostealers and sophisticated tools, per a recent analysis published by Flare. No less than 103 Chrome crypto extensions are targeted by macOS stealers, with attackers obtaining valid Apple developer signatures to bypass
Gatekeeper protections
. “Nearly every macOS stealer prioritizes cryptocurrency theft above all else,” the company
said
.</p>

<p>“This laser focus reflects economic reality. Cryptocurrency users disproportionately use Macs. They often hold significant value in software wallets. Unlike bank accounts, crypto transactions are irreversible.</p>

<p>Once seed phrases are compromised, funds disappear permanently with no recourse.”
“The ‘Macs don’t get viruses’ assumption is not just outdated but actively dangerous. Organizations with Mac users need detection capabilities for macOS-specific TTPs: unsigned applications requesting passwords, unusual Terminal activity, connections to blockchain nodes for non-financial purposes, and data exfiltration patterns targeting Keychain and browser storage.”

<h2 id="google-ties-suspected-russian-actor-to-canfail-malware-attacks-on-ukrainian-orgs"><a id="article-8"></a>Google Ties Suspected Russian Actor to CANFAIL Malware Attacks on Ukrainian Orgs</h2>

<p>A previously undocumented threat actor has been attributed to attacks targeting Ukrainian organizations with malware known as
CANFAIL
. Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) described the hacking group as possibly affiliated with Russian intelligence services. The threat actor is assessed to have targeted defense, military, government, and energy organizations within the Ukrainian regional and national governments. However, the group has also exhibited growing interest in aerospace organizations, manufacturing companies with military and drone ties, nuclear and chemical research organizations, and international organizations involved in conflict monitoring and humanitarian aid in Ukraine, GTIG added.</p>

<p>“Despite being less sophisticated and resourced than other Russian threat groups, this actor recently began to overcome some technical limitations using LLMs [large language models],” GTIG
said
. “Through prompting, they conduct reconnaissance, create lures for social engineering, and seek answers to basic technical questions for post-compromise activity and C2 infrastructure setup.”
Recent phishing campaigns have involved the threat actor impersonating legitimate national and local Ukrainian energy organizations to obtain unauthorized access to organizational and personal email accounts. The group is also said to have masqueraded as a Romanian energy company that works with customers in Ukraine, in addition to targeting a Romanian firm and conducting reconnaissance on Moldovan organizations. To enable its operations, the threat actor generates email address lists tailored to specific regions and industries based on their research.</p>

<p>The attack chains seemingly contain LLM-generated lures and embed Google Drive links pointing to a RAR archive containing CANFAIL malware. Typically disguised with a double extension to pass off as a PDF document (*.pdf.js), CANFAIL is an obfuscated JavaScript malware that’s designed to execute a PowerShell script that, in turn, downloads and executes a memory-only PowerShell dropper. In parallel, it displays a fake “error” message to the victim. Google said the threat actor is also linked to a campaign called
PhantomCaptcha
that was disclosed by SentinelOne SentinelLABS in October 2025 as targeting organizations associated with Ukraine’s war relief efforts through phishing emails that direct recipients to fake pages hosting
ClickFix-style instructions
to activate the infection sequence and deliver a WebSocket-based trojan.</p>

<h2 id="google-links-china-iran-russia-north-korea-to-coordinated-defense-sector-cyber-operations"><a id="article-9"></a>Google Links China, Iran, Russia, North Korea to Coordinated Defense Sector Cyber Operations</h2>

<p>Several state-sponsored actors, hacktivist entities, and criminal groups from China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia have trained their sights on the defense industrial base (DIB) sector, according to findings from Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG). The tech giant’s threat intelligence division said the adversarial targeting of the sector is centered around four key themes: striking defense entities deploying technologies on the battlefield in the Russia-Ukraine War, directly approaching employees and exploitation of the hiring process by North Korean and Iranian actors, use of edge devices and appliances as initial access pathways for China-nexus groups, and supply chain risk stemming from the breach of the manufacturing sector. “Many of the chief state-sponsors of cyber espionage and hacktivist actors have shown an interest in autonomous vehicles and drones, as these platforms play an increasing role in modern warfare,” GTIG
said
. “Further, the ‘evasion of detection’ trend […] continues, as actors focus on single endpoints and individuals, or carry out intrusions in a manner that seeks to avoid endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools altogether.”
Some of the notable threat actors that have participated in the activity include -
APT44 (aka Sandworm)
has attempted to exfiltrate information from Telegram and Signal encrypted messaging applications, likely after securing physical access to devices obtained during on-ground operations in Ukraine.</p>

<p>This includes the use of a Windows batch script called WAVESIGN to decrypt and exfiltrate data from Signal’s desktop app. TEMP.Vermin (aka UAC-0020)
has used malware like VERMONSTER, SPECTRUM (aka SPECTR), and FIRMACHAGENT using lure content revolving around drone production and development, anti-drone defense systems, and video surveillance security systems. UNC5125 (aka FlyingYeti and UAC-0149)
has conducted highly targeted campaigns focusing on frontline drone units. It has used a questionnaire hosted on Google Forms to conduct reconnaissance against prospective drone operators, and distributed via messaging apps malware like MESSYFORK (aka COOKBOX) to an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) operator based in Ukraine.</p>

<p>UNC5125
is also said to have leveraged an Android malware called GREYBATTLE, a bespoke version of the
Hydra
banking trojan, to steal credentials and data by distributing it via a website spoofing a Ukrainian military artificial intelligence company. UNC5792 (aka UAC-0195)
has exploited secure messaging apps to target Ukrainian military and government entities, as well as individuals and organizations in Moldova, Georgia, France, and the U.S. The threat actor is notable for weaponizing Signal’s device linking feature to hijack victim accounts. UNC4221 (aka UAC-0185)
has also targeted secure messaging apps used by Ukrainian military personnel, using tactics similar to UNC5792.</p>

<p>The threat actor has also leveraged an Android malware called STALECOOKIE that mimics Ukraine’s battlefield management platform
DELTA
to steal browser cookies. Another tactic employed by the group is the use of
ClickFix
to deliver the TINYWHALE downloader that, in turn, drops the
MeshAgent
remote management software. UNC5976
, a Russian espionage cluster that has conducted a phishing campaign delivering malicious RDP connection files that are configured to communicate with actor-controlled domains mimicking a Ukrainian telecommunications company. UNC6096
, a Russian espionage cluster that has conducted malware delivery operations via WhatsApp using DELTA-related themes to deliver a malicious LNK shortcut within an archive file that downloads a secondary payload.</p>

<p>Attacks aimed at Android devices have been found to deliver malware called GALLGRAB that collects locally stored files, contact information, and potentially encrypted user data from specialized battlefield applications. UNC5114
, a suspected Russian espionage cluster that has delivered a variant of an off-the-shelf Android malware called
CraxsRAT
by masquerading it as an update for
Kropyva
, a combat control system used in Ukraine. APT45 (aka Andariel)
has targeted South Korean defense, semiconductor, and automotive manufacturing entities with
SmallTiger
malware. APT43 (aka Kimsuky)
has likely leveraged infrastructure mimicking German and U.S.</p>

<p>defense-related entities to deploy a backdoor called THINWAVE. UNC2970 (aka Lazarus Group)
has conducted the Operation Dream Job campaign to target aerospace, defense, and energy sectors, in addition to relying on artificial intelligence (AI) tools to conduct reconnaissance on its targets. UNC1549 (aka Nimbus Manticore)
has targeted aerospace, aviation, and defense industries in the Middle East with malware families like MINIBIKE, TWOSTROKE, DEEPROOT, and CRASHPAD. The group is known to orchestrate Lazarus Group-style
Dream Job campaigns
to trick users into executing malware or giving up credentials under the guise of legitimate employment opportunities.</p>

<p>UNC6446
, an Iranian-nexus threat actor that has used resume builder and personality test applications to distribute custom malware to targets in the aerospace and defense vertical across the U.S. and the Middle East. APT5 (aka Keyhole Panda and Mulberry Typhoon)
has targeted current and former employees of major aerospace and defense contractors with tailored phishing lures. UNC3236 (aka Volt Typhoon)
has conducted reconnaissance activity against publicly hosted login portals of North American military and defense contractors, while using the ARCMAZE obfuscation framework to conceal its origin.</p>

<p>UNC6508
, a China-nexus threat cluster that targeted a U.S.-based research institution in late 2023 by leveraging a REDCap exploit to drop a custom malware named INFINITERED that’s capable of persistent remote access and credential theft after intercepting the application’s software upgrade process. In addition, Google said it has also observed China-nexus threat groups utilizing
operational relay box (ORB) networks
for reconnaissance against defense industrial targets, thereby complicating detection and attribution efforts. ORBs confer several advantages to threat actors, allowing them to route their traffic through home or commercial networks, blend with regular network traffic, circumvent geofencing security controls, and pre-position themselves to a target’s perimeter ahead of a cyber attack. ORBs are also resilient to takedown attempts, as attackers managing them can scale these networks to add more devices, even if some nodes are discovered and blocked.</p>

<p>“While specific risks vary by geographic footprint and sub-sector specialization, the broader trend is clear: the defense industrial base is under a state of constant, multi-vector siege,” Google said. “Financially motivated actors carry out extortion against this sector and the broader manufacturing base, like many of the other verticals they target for monetary gain.”
“The campaigns against defense contractors in Ukraine, threats to or exploitation of defense personnel, the persistent volume of intrusions by China-nexus actors, and the hack, leak, and disruption of the manufacturing base are some of the leading threats to this industry today.”

<h2 id="uat-9921-deploys-voidlink-malware-to-target-technology-and-financial-sectors"><a id="article-10"></a>UAT-9921 Deploys VoidLink Malware to Target Technology and Financial Sectors</h2>

<p>A previously unknown threat actor tracked as
UAT-9921
has been observed leveraging a new modular framework called VoidLink in its campaigns targeting the technology and financial services sectors, according to findings from Cisco Talos. “This threat actor seems to have been active since 2019, although they have not necessarily used VoidLink over the duration of their activity,” researchers Nick Biasini, Aaron Boyd, Asheer Malhotra, and Vitor Ventura
said
. “UAT-9921 uses compromised hosts to install VoidLink command-and-control (C2), which are then used to launch scanning activities both internal and external to the network.”
VoidLink was
first documented
by Check Point last month, describing it as a feature-rich malware framework written in Zig designed for long-term, stealthy access to Linux-based cloud environments. It’s assessed to be the work of a single developer with assistance from a large language model (LLM) to flesh out its internals based on a paradigm called
spec-driven development
.</p>

<p>In another analysis published earlier this week, Ontinue
pointed out
that the emergence of VoidLink presents a new concern where LLM-generated implants, packed with kernel-level rootkits and features to target cloud environments, can further lower the skill barrier required to produce hard-to-detect malware. Per Talos, UAT-9921 is believed to possess knowledge of the Chinese language, given the language of the framework and code comments present in it. The toolkit is said to be a recent addition to its arsenal. It is also believed that the development was split across teams, although the extent of the demarcation between development and the actual operations remains unclear.</p>

<p>“The operators deploying VoidLink have access to the source code of some [kernel] modules and some tools to interact with the implants without the C2,” the researchers noted. “This indicates inner knowledge of the communication protocols of the implants.”
VoidLink is deployed as a post-compromise tool, allowing the adversary to sidestep detection. The threat actor has also been observed deploying a SOCKS proxy on compromised servers to launch scans for internal reconnaissance and lateral movement using open-source tools like
Fscan
. The cybersecurity company said it’s aware of multiple VoidLink-related victims dating back to September 2025, indicating that work on the malware may have commenced much earlier than the November 2025 timeline pieced together by Check Point.</p>

<p>When reached for comment regarding the latest findings, Pedro Drimel Neto, malware analysis lead at Check Point Software, told The Hacker News via email that they have not observed evidence of VoidLink “being used as of September 2025 and threat actor activity since 2019,” and that “we cannot independently verify activity outside of the datasets and sources available to us.”
VoidLink uses three different programming languages: ZigLang for the implant, C for the plugins, and GoLang for the backend. It supports compilation on demand for plugins, providing support for the different Linux distributions that might be targeted. The plugins allow for gathering information, lateral movement, and anti-forensics. The framework also comes fitted with a wide range of stealth mechanisms to hinder analysis, prevent its removal from the infected hosts, and even detect endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions and devise an evasion strategy on the fly.</p>

<p>“The C2 will provide that implant with a plugin to read a specific database the operator has found or an exploit for a known vulnerability, which just happens to be on an internal web server,” Talos said. “The C2 doesn’t necessarily need to have all these tools available — it may have an agent that will do its research and prepare the tool for the operator to use. With the current VoidLink compile-on-demand capability, integrating such a feature should not be complex. Keep in mind that all of this will happen while the operator continues to explore the environment.”
Another defining trait of VoidLink is its auditability and the existence of a role-based access control (RBAC) mechanism, which consists of three role levels: SuperAdmin, Operator, and Viewer.</p>

<p>This suggests that the developers of the framework kept oversight in mind when designing it, raising the possibility that the activity may be part of red team exercises. What’s more, there are signs that there exists a main implant that has been compiled for Windows and can load plugins via a technique called DLL side-loading. “This is a near-production-ready proof of concept,” Talos said. “VoidLink is positioned to become an even more powerful framework based on its capabilities and flexibility.”

<h2 id="malicious-chrome-extensions-caught-stealing-business-data-emails-and-browsing-history"><a id="article-11"></a>Malicious Chrome Extensions Caught Stealing Business Data, Emails, and Browsing History</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a malicious Google Chrome extension that’s designed to steal data associated with Meta Business Suite and Facebook Business Manager. The extension, named CL Suite by @CLMasters (ID: jkphinfhmfkckkcnifhjiplhfoiefffl), is marketed as a way to scrape Meta Business Suite data, remove verification pop-ups, and generate two-factor authentication (2FA) codes. The extension has 33 users as of writing. It was first uploaded to the Chrome Web Store on March 1, 2025.</p>

<p>However, the browser add-on also exfiltrates TOTP codes for Facebook and Meta Business accounts, Business Manager contact lists, and analytics data to infrastructure controlled by the threat actor, Socket said. “The extension requests broad access to meta.com and facebook.com and claims in its privacy policy that 2FA secrets and Business Manager data remain local,” security researcher Kirill Boychenko
said
. “In practice, the code transmits TOTP seeds and current one-time security codes, Meta Business ‘People’ CSV exports, and Business Manager analytics data to a backend at getauth[.]pro, with an option to forward the same payloads to a Telegram channel controlled by the threat actor.”
By targeting users of Meta Business Suite and Facebook Business Manager, the threat actor behind the operation has leveraged the extension to conduct data collection and exfiltration without users’ knowledge or consent. While the extension does not have capabilities to steal password-related information, the attacker could obtain such information beforehand from other sources, such as infostealer logs or credential dumps, and then use the stolen codes to gain unauthorized access to victims’ accounts.</p>

<p>The full scope of the malicious add-on’s capabilities is listed below -
Steal TOTP seed (a unique, alphanumeric code that’s used to generate time-based one-time passwords) and 2FA code
Target Business Manager “People” view by navigating to facebook[.]com and meta[.]com and build a CSV file with names, email addresses, roles and permissions, and their status and access details. Enumerate Business Manager-level entities and their linked assets and build a CSV file of Business Manager IDs and names, attached ad accounts, connected pages and assets, and billing and payment configuration details. Socket warned that despite the low number of installs, the extension gives the threat actor enough information to identify high-value targets and mount follow-on attacks. “CL Suite by @CLMasters shows how a narrow browser extension can repackage data scraping as a ‘tool’ for Meta Business Suite and Facebook Business Manager,” Boychenko said.</p>

<p>“Its people extraction, Business Manager analytics, popup suppression, and in-browser 2FA generation are not neutral productivity features, they are purpose-built scrapers for high-value Meta surfaces that collect contact lists, access metadata, and 2FA material straight from authenticated pages.”
Chrome Extensions Hijack VKontakte Accounts
The disclosure comes as Koi Security
found
that about 500,000 VKontakte users have had their accounts silently hijacked through Chrome extensions masquerading as VK customization tools. The large-scale campaign has been codenamed
VK Styles
. The malware embedded in the extensions is designed to engage in active account manipulation by automatically subscribing users to the attacker’s VK groups, resetting account settings every 30 days to override user preferences, manipulating Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens to bypass VK’s security protections, and maintaining persistent control. The activity has been traced to a threat actor operating under the GitHub username 2vk, who has relied on VK’s own social network to distribute malicious payloads and build a follower base through forced subscriptions.</p>

<p>The names of the extensions are listed below -
VK Styles - Themes for vk.com (ID: ceibjdigmfbbgcpkkdpmjokkokklodmc)
VK Music - audio saver (ID: mflibpdjoodmoppignjhciadahapkoch)
Music Downloader - VKsaver (ID: lgakkahjfibfgmacigibnhcgepajgfdb)
vksaver - music saver vk (ID: bndkfmmbidllaiccmpnbdonijmicaafn)
VKfeed - Download Music and Video from VK (ID: pcdgkgbadeggbnodegejccjffnoakcoh)
One of the defining traits of the campaign is the use of a VK profile’s (“vk[.]com/m0nda”) HTML metadata tags as a dead drop resolver to conceal the next-stage payload URLs and, therefore, evade detection. The next-stage payload is hosted in a public repository named “-“ that’s associated with 2vk. Present in the payload is obfuscated JavaScript that’s injected into every VK page the victim visits. The repository is still accessible as of writing, with the file, simply named “C,” receiving a total of 17 commits between June 2025 and January 2026, as the operator refined and added new functionality.</p>

<p>“Each commit shows deliberate refinement,” security researcher Ariel Cohen said. “This isn’t sloppy malware - it’s a maintained software project with version control, testing, and iterative improvements.”
VK Styles has primarily affected Russian-speaking users, who are VK’s main demographic, as well as users across Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and Russian diaspora communities globally. The campaign is assessed to be active since at least June 22, 2025, when the initial version of the payload was pushed to the “-“ repository. Fake AI Chrome Extensions Steal Credentials, Emails
The findings also coincide with the discovery of another coordinated campaign dubbed
AiFrame
, where a cluster of 32 browser add-ons advertised as artificial intelligence (AI) assistants for summarization, chat, writing, and Gmail assistance are being used to siphon sensitive data.</p>

<p>These extensions have been collectively installed by more than 260,000 users. “While these tools appear legitimate on the surface, they hide a dangerous architecture: instead of implementing core functionality locally, they embed remote, server-controlled interfaces inside extension-controlled surfaces and act as privileged proxies, granting remote infrastructure access to sensitive browser capabilities,” LayerX researcher Natalie Zargarov
said

Chat GPT for Gmail (ID: fpmkabpaklbhbhegegapfkenkmpipick)
Once installed, these extensions render a full-screen iframe overlay pointing to a remote domain (“claude.tapnetic[.]pro”), allowing the attackers to remotely introduce new capabilities without requiring a Chrome Web Store update. When instructed by the iframe, the add-ons query the active browser tab and invoke a content script to extract readable article content using Mozilla’s Readability library.</p>

<p>The malware also supports the capability to start speech recognition and exfiltrate the resulting transcript to the remote page. What’s more, a smaller set of the extensions contain functionality to specifically target Gmail by reading visible email content directly from the document object model (DOM) when a victim visits mail.google[.]com. “When Gmail-related features such as AI-assisted replies or summaries are invoked, the extracted email content is passed into the extension’s logic and transmitted to third-party backend infrastructure controlled by the extension operator,” LayerX said. “As a result, email message text and related contextual data may be sent off-device, outside of Gmail’s security boundary, to remote servers.”
287 Chrome Extensions Exfiltrate Browsing History
The developments show how web browser extensions are
increasingly being abused
by bad actors to harvest and exfiltrate sensitive data by passing them off as seemingly legitimate tools and utilities.</p>

<p>A report published by Q Continuum last week found a huge collection of 287 Chrome extensions that exfiltrate browsing history to data brokers. These extensions have 37.4 million installations, representing roughly 1% of the global Chrome userbase. “It was shown in the past that Chrome extensions are used to exfiltrate user browser history that is then collected by data brokers such as Similarweb and Alexa,” the researcher
said
. Given the risks involved, users are
recommended
to adopt a minimalist approach by only installing necessary, well-reviewed tools from official stores.</p>

<p>It’s also essential to periodically audit installed extensions for any signs of malicious behavior or excessive permission requests. Other ways that users and organizations can ensure greater security include using separate browser profiles for sensitive tasks and implementing extension allowlisting to block those that are malicious or non-compliant.

<h2 id="npms-update-to-harden-their-supply-chain-and-points-to-consider"><a id="article-12"></a>npm’s Update to Harden Their Supply Chain, and Points to Consider</h2>

<p>In December 2025, in response to the Sha1-Hulud incident, npm completed a
major authentication overhaul
intended to reduce supply-chain attacks. While the overhaul is a solid step forward, the changes don’t make npm projects immune from supply-chain attacks. npm is still susceptible to malware attacks – here’s what you need to know for a safer Node community. Let’s start with the original problem
Historically, npm relied on classic tokens: long-lived, broadly scoped credentials that could persist indefinitely.</p>

<p>If stolen, attackers could directly publish malicious versions to the author’s packages (no publicly verifiable source code needed). This made npm a prime vector for supply-chain attacks. Over time, numerous real-world incidents demonstrated this point. Shai-Hulud, Sha1-Hulud, and chalk/debug are examples of recent, notable attacks.</p>

<p>npm’s solution
To address this, npm made the following changes:
npm revoked all classic tokens and defaulted to session-based tokens instead. The npm team also improved token management. Interactive workflows now use short-lived session tokens (typically two hours) obtained via npm login, which
defaults
to MFA for publishing. The npm team also encourages OIDC Trusted Publishing, in which CI systems obtain short-lived, per-run credentials rather than storing secrets at rest.</p>

<p>In combination, these practices improve security. They ensure credentials expire quickly and require a second factor during sensitive operations. Two important issues remain
First, people need to remember that the original attack on tools like ChalkJS was a successful MFA phishing attempt on npm’s console. If you look at the original email attached below, you can see it was an MFA-focused phishing email (nothing like trying to do the right thing and still getting burned).</p>

<p>The campaign tricked the maintainer into sharing both the user login and one-time password. This means in the future, similar emails could get short-lived tokens, which still give attackers enough time to upload malware (since that would only take minutes). Second, MFA on publish is optional. Developers can still create 90-day tokens with MFA bypass enabled in the console, which are extremely similar to the classic tokens from before.</p>

<p>These tokens allow you to read and write to a token author’s maintained packages. This means that if bad actors gain access to a maintainer’s console with these token settings, they can publish new, malicious packages (and versions) on that author’s behalf. This circles us back to the original issue with npm before they adjusted their credential policies. To be clear, more developers using MFA on publish is good news, and future attacks should be fewer and smaller.</p>

<p>However, making OIDC and MFA on-publish
optional
still leaves the core issue unresolved. In conclusion, if (1) MFA phishing attempts to npm’s console still work and (2) access to the console equals access to publish new packages/versions, then developers need to be aware of the supply-chain risks that still exist. Recommendations
In the spirit of open source security, here are three recommendations that we hope GitHub and npm will consider in the future. Ideally, they continue to push for the ubiquity of OIDC in the long term.</p>

<p>OIDC is very hard to compromise and would almost completely erase the issues surrounding supply-chain attacks. More realistically, enforcing MFA for local package uploads (either via an email code or a one-time password) would further reduce the blast radius of worms like Shai-Hulud. In other words, it would be an improvement to
not allow
custom tokens that bypass MFA. At a minimum, it would be nice to add metadata to package releases, so developers can take precautions and avoid packages (or maintainers) who do not take supply chain security measures.</p>

<p>In short, npm has taken an important step forward by eliminating permanent tokens and improving defaults. Until short-lived, identity-bound credentials become the norm — and MFA bypass is no longer required for automation — supply-chain risk from compromised build systems remains materially present. A new way to do it
This entire time, we’ve been talking about supply-chain attacks by uploading packages to npm on a maintainer’s behalf. If we could build every npm package from verifiable upstream source code rather than downloading the artifact from npm, we’d be better off.</p>

<p>That’s exactly what Chainguard does for its customers with Chainguard Libraries for JavaScript. We’ve looked at the public database for compromised packages across npm
and discovered that for 98.5% of malicious packages, the malware was not present in the upstream source code (just the published artifact). This means an approach of building from source would reduce your attack surface by some 98.5%, based on past data, because Chainguard’s JavaScript repository would never publish the malicious versions available on npm. In an ideal world, customers are most secure when they use Chainguard Libraries and apply the recommendations above.</p>

<p>Per the “Swiss cheese model of security,” all of these features are layers of additive security measures, and companies would be best off using a combination of them. If you’d like to learn more about Chainguard Libraries for JavaScript,
