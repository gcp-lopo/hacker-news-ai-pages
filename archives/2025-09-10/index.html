<h2 id="adobe-commerce-flaw-cve-2025-54236-lets-hackers-take-over-customer-accounts"><a id="article-1"></a>Adobe Commerce Flaw CVE-2025-54236 Lets Hackers Take Over Customer Accounts</h2>

<p>Adobe has
warned
of a critical security flaw in its Commerce and Magento Open Source platforms that, if successfully exploited, could allow attackers to take control of customer accounts. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-54236 (aka SessionReaper), carries a CVSS score of 9.1 out of a maximum of 10.0. It has been described as an improper input validation flaw. Adobe said it‚Äôs not aware of any exploits in the wild.</p>

<p>‚ÄúA potential attacker could take over customer accounts in Adobe Commerce through the Commerce REST API,‚Äù Adobe
said
in an advisory issued today. The issue impacts the following products and versions -
Adobe Commerce (all deployment methods):
2.4.9-alpha2 and earlier
2.4.8-p2 and earlier
2.4.7-p7 and earlier
2.4.6-p12 and earlier
2.4.5-p14 and earlier
2.4.4-p15 and earlier
Adobe Commerce B2B:
1.5.3-alpha2 and earlier
1.5.2-p2 and earlier
1.4.2-p7 and earlier
1.3.4-p14 and earlier
1.3.3-p15 and earlier
Magento Open Source:
2.4.9-alpha2 and earlier
2.4.8-p2 and earlier
2.4.7-p7 and earlier
2.4.6-p12 and earlier
2.4.5-p14 and earlier
Custom Attributes Serializable module:
Versions 0.1.0 to 0.4.0
Adobe, in addition to releasing a hotfix for the vulnerability, said it has deployed web application firewall (WAF) rules to protect environments against exploitation attempts that may target merchants using Adobe Commerce on Cloud infrastructure. ‚ÄúSessionReaper is one of the more severe Magento vulnerabilities in its history, comparable to
Shoplift
(2015),
Ambionics SQLi
(2019),
TrojanOrder
(2022), and
CosmicSting
(2024),‚Äù e-commerce security company Sansec
said
. The Netherlands-based firm said it successfully reproduced one possible way to exploit CVE-2025-54236, but noted that there are other possible avenues to weaponize the vulnerability.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe vulnerability follows a familiar pattern from last year‚Äôs CosmicSting attack,‚Äù it added. ‚ÄúThe attack combines a malicious session with a nested deserialization bug in Magento‚Äôs REST API.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe specific remote code execution vector appears to require file-based session storage. However, we recommend merchants using Redis or database sessions to take immediate action as well, as there are multiple ways to abuse this vulnerability.‚Äù
Adobe has also shipped fixes to contain a critical path traversal vulnerability in ColdFusion (
CVE-2025-54261
, CVSS score: 9.0) that could lead to an arbitrary file system write. It impacts ColdFusion 2021 (Update 21 and earlier), 2023 (Update 15 and earlier), and 2025 (Update 3 and earlier) on all platforms.</p>

<h2 id="sap-patches-critical-netweaver-cvss-up-to-100-and-previously-exploited-s4hana-flaws"><a id="article-2"></a>SAP Patches Critical NetWeaver (CVSS Up to 10.0) and Previously Exploited S/4HANA Flaws</h2>

<p>SAP on Tuesday
released
security updates to address multiple security flaws, including three critical vulnerabilities in SAP Netweaver that could result in code execution and the upload arbitrary files. The vulnerabilities are listed below -
CVE-2025-42944
(CVSS score: 10.0) - A deserialization vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to submit a malicious payload to an open port through the
RMI-P4 module
, resulting in operating system command execution
CVE-2025-42922
(CVSS score: 9.9) - An insecure file operations vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver AS Java that could allow an attacker authenticated as a non-administrative user to upload an arbitrary file
CVE-2025-42958
(CVSS score: 9.1) - A missing authentication check vulnerability in the SAP NetWeaver application on IBM i-series that could allow highly privileged unauthorized users to read, modify, or delete sensitive information, as well as access administrative or privileged functionalities
‚Äú[CVE-2025-42944] allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands by submitting a malicious payload to an open port,‚Äù Onapsis
said
. ‚ÄúA successful exploit can lead to full compromise of the application. As a temporary workaround, customers should add P4 port filtering at the ICM level to prevent unknown hosts from connecting to the P4 port.‚Äù
Also addressed by SAP is a high-severity missing input validation bug in SAP S/4HANA (
CVE-2025-42916
, CVSS score: 8.1) that could permit an attacker with high privilege access to ABAP reports to delete the content of arbitrary database tables, should the tables not be protected by an authorization group.</p>

<p>The patches arrive days after SecurityBridge and Pathlock
disclosed
that a critical security defect in SAP S/4HANA that was fixed by the company last month (CVE-2025-42957, CVSS score: 9.9) has come under active exploitation in the wild. While there is no evidence that the newly disclosed issues have been weaponized by bad actors, it‚Äôs essential that users move to apply the necessary updates as soon as possible for optimal protection.

<h2 id="axios-abuse-and-salty-2fa-kits-fuel-advanced-microsoft-365-phishing-attacks"><a id="article-3"></a>Axios Abuse and Salty 2FA Kits Fuel Advanced Microsoft 365 Phishing Attacks</h2>

<p>Threat actors are abusing HTTP client tools like
Axios
in conjunction with Microsoft‚Äôs Direct Send feature to form a ‚Äúhighly efficient attack pipeline‚Äù in recent phishing campaigns, according to new findings from ReliaQuest. ‚ÄúAxios user agent activity surged 241% from June to August 2025, dwarfing the 85% growth of all other flagged user agents combined,‚Äù the cybersecurity company
said
in a report shared with The Hacker News. ‚ÄúOut of 32 flagged user agents observed in this timeframe, Axios accounted for 24.44% of all activity.‚Äù
The abuse of Axios was
previously flagged
by Proofpoint in January 2025, detailing campaigns utilizing HTTP clients to send HTTP requests and receive HTTP responses from web servers to conduct account takeover (ATO) attacks on Microsoft 365 environments. ReliaQuest told The Hacker News that there is no evidence to suggest these activities are related, adding that the tool is regularly exploited alongside popular phishing kits.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe usefulness of Axios means it is almost certainly being adopted by all types of threat actors regardless of sophistication levels or motivation,‚Äù the company added. Similarly, phishing campaigns have also been observed increasingly using a legitimate feature in Microsoft 365 (M365) called
Direct Send
to
spoof trusted users
and distribute email messages. In amplifying Axios abuse through Microsoft Direct Send, the attack aims to weaponize a trusted delivery method to ensure that their messages slip past secure gateways and land in users‚Äô inboxes. Indeed, attacks that paired Axios with Direct Send have been found to achieve a 70% success rate in recent campaigns, surging past non-Axios campaigns with ‚Äúunparalleled efficiency.‚Äù
The campaign observed by ReliaQuest is said to have commenced in July 2025, initially singling out executives and managers in finance, health care, and manufacturing sectors, before expanding its focus to target all users.</p>

<p>Calling the approach a game changer for attackers, the company pointed out that the campaign not only is successful at bypassing traditional security defenses with improved precision, but also enables them to mount phishing operations at an unprecedented scale. In these attacks, Axios is used to intercept, modify, and replay HTTP requests, thereby making it possible to capture session tokens or multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes in real-time or exploit SAS tokens in Azure authentication workflows to gain access to sensitive resources. ‚ÄúAttackers use this blind spot to bypass MFA, hijack session tokens, and automate phishing workflows,‚Äù ReliaQuest said. ‚ÄúThe customizability offered by Axios lets attackers tailor their activity to further mimic legitimate workflows.‚Äù
The email messages involve using compensation-themed lures to trick recipients into opening PDF documents containing malicious QR codes, which, when scanned, direct users to fake login pages mimicking Microsoft Outlook to facilitate credential theft.</p>

<p>As an extra layer of defense evasion, some of these pages are hosted on Google Firebase infrastructure to capitalize on the reputation of the app development platform. Besides lowering the technical barrier for sophisticated attacks, Axios‚Äôs prevalence in enterprise and developer setups also means that it offers attackers a way to blend in with regular traffic and fly under the radar. To mitigate the risk posed by this threat, organizations are advised to secure Direct Send and disable it if not required, configure appropriate anti-spoofing policies on email gateways, train employees to recognize phishing emails, and block suspicious domains. ‚ÄúAxios amplifies the impact of phishing campaigns by bridging the gap between initial access and full-scale exploitation.</p>

<p>Its ability to manipulate authentication workflows and replay HTTP requests allows attackers to weaponize stolen credentials in ways that are both scalable and precise.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis makes Axios integral to the rising success of Direct Send phishing campaigns, showing how attackers are evolving beyond traditional phishing tactics to exploit authentication systems and APIs at a level that traditional defenses are ill-equipped to handle.‚Äù
The development comes as Mimecast detailed a large-scale credential harvesting campaign targeting hospitality industry professionals by impersonating trusted hotel management platforms Expedia Partner Central and Cloudbeds in emails that claim to be guest booking confirmations and partner central notifications. ‚ÄúThis credential harvesting operation leverages the routine nature of hotel booking communications,‚Äù the company
said
. ‚ÄúThe campaign employs urgent, business-critical subject lines designed to prompt immediate action from hotel managers and staff.‚Äù
The findings also follow the discovery of an ongoing campaign that has employed a nascent phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) offering called
Salty 2FA
to steal Microsoft login credentials and sidestep MFA by simulating six different methods: SMS authentication, authenticator apps, phone calls, push notifications, backup codes, and hardware tokens. The attack chain is notable for leveraging services like Aha[.]io to stage initial landing pages that masquerade as OneDrive sharing notifications to deceive email recipients and trick them into clicking on fake links that redirect to credential harvesting pages, but not before completing a Cloudflare Turnstile verification check to filter automated security tools and sandboxes.</p>

<p>The phishing pages also include other advanced features like geofencing and IP filtering to block traffic from known security vendor IP address ranges and cloud providers, disable shortcuts to launch developer tools in web browsers, and assign new subdomains for each victim session. In incorporating these techniques, the end goal is to complicate analysis efforts. These findings illustrate how phishing attacks have matured into enterprise-grade operations, utilizing advanced evasion tactics and convincing MFA simulations, while exploiting trusted platforms and mimicking corporate portals to make it harder to distinguish between real and fraudulent activity. ‚ÄúThe phishing kit implements dynamic branding functionality to enhance social engineering effectiveness,‚Äù Ontinue
said
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúTechnical analysis reveals the malicious infrastructure maintains a corporate theme database that automatically customizes fraudulent login interfaces based on victim email domains.‚Äù
‚ÄúSalty2FA demonstrates how cybercriminals now approach infrastructure with the same methodical planning that enterprises use for their own systems. What makes this particularly concerning is how these techniques blur the line between legitimate and malicious traffic.‚Äù

<h2 id="raton-android-malware-detected-with-nfc-relay-and-ats-banking-fraud-capabilities"><a id="article-4"></a>RatOn Android Malware Detected With NFC Relay and ATS Banking Fraud Capabilities</h2>

<p>A new Android malware called
RatOn
has evolved from a basic tool capable of conducting Near Field Communication (
NFC
) relay attacks to a sophisticated remote access trojan with Automated Transfer System (
ATS
) capabilities to conduct device fraud. ‚ÄúRatOn merges traditional overlay attacks with automatic money transfers and NFC relay functionality ‚Äì making it a uniquely powerful threat,‚Äù the Dutch mobile security company
said
in a report published today. The banking trojan comes fitted with account takeover functions targeting cryptocurrency wallet applications like MetaMask, Trust, Blockchain.com, and Phantom, while also capable of carrying out automated money transfers abusing George ƒåesko, a bank application used in the Czech Republic. Furthermore, it can perform ransomware-like attacks using custom overlay pages and device locking.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs worth noting that a variant of the HOOK Android trojan was also
observed
incorporating ransomware-style overlay screens to display extortion messages. The first sample distributing RatOn was detected in the wild on July 5, 2025, with more artifacts discovered as recently as August 29, 2025, indicating active development work on the part of the operators. RatOn has leveraged fake Play Store listing pages masquerading as an adult-friendly version of TikTok (TikTok 18+) to host malicious dropper apps that deliver the trojan. It‚Äôs currently not clear how users are lured to these sites, but the activity has singled out Czech and Slovakian-speaking users.</p>

<p>Once the dropper app is installed, it requests permission from the user to install applications from third-party sources so as to bypass critical security measures imposed by Google to prevent abuse of Android‚Äôs accessibility services. The second-stage payload then proceeds to request
device administration
and accessibility services, as well as permissions to read/write contacts and manage system settings to realize its malicious functionality. This includes granting itself additional permissions as required and downloading a third-stage malware, which is nothing but the NFSkate malware that can perform NFC relay attacks using a technique called Ghost Tap. The malware family was
first documented
in November 2024.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe account takeover and automated transfer features have shown that the threat actor knows the internals of the targeted applications quite well,‚Äù ThreatFabric said, describing the malware as built from scratch and sharing no code similarities with other Android banking malware. That‚Äôs not all. RatOn can also serve overlay screens that resemble a ransom note, claiming that users‚Äô phones have been locked for viewing and distributing child pornography and that they need to pay $200 in cryptocurrency to regain access in two hours. It‚Äôs suspected that the ransom notes are designed to induce a false sense of urgency and coerce the victim into opening the cryptocurrency apps, making the transaction immediately, and enabling the attackers to capture the device PIN code in the process.</p>

<p>‚ÄúUpon corresponding command, RatOn can launch the targeted cryptocurrency wallet app, unlock it using stolen PIN code, click on interface elements which are related to security settings of the app, and on the final step, reveal secret phrases,‚Äù ThreatFabric said, detailing its account takeover features. The sensitive data is subsequently recorded by a keylogger component and exfiltrated to an external server under the control of the threat actors, who can then use the seed phrases to obtain unauthorized access to the victims‚Äô accounts and steal cryptocurrency assets. Some notable commands that are processed by RatOn are listed below -
send_push, to send fake push notifications
screen_lock, to change the device lock screen timeout to a specified value
WhatsApp, to launch WhatsApp
app_inject, to change the list of targeted financial applications
update_device, to send a list of installed apps with device fingerprint
send_sms, to send a SMS message using accessibility services
Facebook, to launch Facebook
nfs, to download and run the NFSkate APK malware
transfer, perform ATS using George ƒåesko
lock, to lock the device using device administration access
add_contact, to create a new contact using a specified name and phone number
record, to launch a screen casting session
display, to turn on/off screen casting
‚ÄúThe threat actor group initially targeted the Czech Republic, with Slovakia likely being the next country of focus,‚Äù ThreatFabric said. ‚ÄúThe reason behind concentrating on a single banking application remains unclear.</p>

<p>However, the fact that automated transfers require local banking account numbers suggests that the threat actors may be collaborating with local money mules.‚Äù

<h2 id="from-mostererat-to-clickfix-new-malware-campaigns-highlight-rising-ai-and-phishing-risks"><a id="article-6"></a>From MostereRAT to ClickFix: New Malware Campaigns Highlight Rising AI and Phishing Risks</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a phishing campaign that delivers a stealthy banking malware-turned-remote access trojan called
MostereRAT
. The phishing attack incorporates a number of advanced evasion techniques to gain complete control over compromised systems, siphon sensitive data, and extend its functionality by serving secondary plugins, Fortinet FortiGuard Labs said. ‚ÄúThese include the use of an Easy Programming Language (
EPL
) to develop a staged payload, concealing malicious operations and disabling security tools to prevent alert triggers, securing command-and-control (C2) communications using mutual TLS (mTLS), supporting various methods for deploying additional payloads, and even installing popular remote access tools,‚Äù Yurren Wan
said
. EPL
is an obscure visual programming language that supports traditional Chinese, simplified Chinese, English, and Japanese variants.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs chiefly meant for users who may not be proficient in English. The emails, which are primarily designed to target Japanese users, leverage lures related to business inquiries to deceive recipients into clicking on malicious links that take them to an infected site to download a booby-trapped document ‚Äì a Microsoft Word file that embeds a ZIP archive. Present within the ZIP file is an executable that, in turn, triggers the execution of MostereRAT, which is then used to drop several tools like AnyDesk, TigerVNC, and TightVNC using modules written in EPL. A noteworthy aspect of the malware is its ability to disable Windows security mechanisms and block network traffic associated with a hard-coded list of security programs, thereby allowing it to sidestep detection.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis traffic-blocking technique resembles that of the known red team tool ‚Äò
EDRSilencer
,‚Äô which uses Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) filters at multiple stages of the network communication stack, effectively preventing it from connecting to its servers and from transmitting detection data, alerts, event logs, or other telemetry,‚Äù Wan said. Another is its ability to run as TrustedInstaller, a built-in Windows system account with elevated permissions, enabling it to interfere with critical Windows processes, modify Windows Registry entries, and delete system files. Furthermore, one of the modules deployed by MostereRAT is equipped to monitor foreground window activity associated with Qianniu - Alibaba‚Äôs Seller Tool, log keystrokes, send heartbeat signals to an external server, and process commands issued by the server. The commands allow it to collect victim host details, run DLL, EPK, or EXE files, load shellcode, read/write/delete files, download and inject an EXE into svchost.exe using Early Bird Injection, enumerate users, capture screenshots, facilitate RDP logins, and even create and add a hidden user to the administrators group.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThese tactics significantly increase the difficulty of detection, prevention, and analysis,‚Äù Fortinet said. ‚ÄúIn addition to keeping your solution updated, educating users about the dangers of social engineering remains essential.‚Äù
ClickFix Gets Another Novel Twist
The findings coincide with the emergence of another campaign that employs ‚Äú
ClickFix
-esque techniques‚Äù to distribute a commodity information stealer known as MetaStealer to users searching for tools like AnyDesk. The attack chain involves serving a fake Cloudflare Turnstile page before downloading the supposed AnyDesk installer, and prompts them to click on a check box to complete a verification step. However, this action triggers a pop-up message asking them to open Windows File Explorer.</p>

<p>Once the Windows File Explorer is opened, PHP code concealed in the Turnstile verification page is configured to employ the ‚Äú
search-ms:
‚Äú URI protocol handler to display a Windows shortcut (LNK) file disguised as a PDF that‚Äôs hosted on an attacker‚Äôs site. The LNK file, for its part, activates a series of steps to gather the hostname and run an MSI package that‚Äôs ultimately responsible for dropping MetaStealer. ‚ÄúThese types of attacks that require some level of manual interaction from the victim, as they work to ‚Äòfix‚Äô the purported broken process themselves, work in part because they can potentially circumvent security solutions,‚Äù Huntress
said
. ‚ÄúThreat actors are continuing to move the needle in their infection chains, throwing a wrench into detection and prevention.‚Äù
The disclosure also comes as CloudSEK detailed a novel adaptation of the ClickFix social engineering tactic that leverages invisible prompts using CSS-based obfuscation methods to weaponize AI systems and produce summaries that include attacker-controlled ClickFix instructions.</p>

<p>The proof-of-concept (PoC) attack is accomplished by using a strategy called prompt overdose, wherein the payload is embedded within HTML content extensively so that it dominates a large language model‚Äôs context window in order to steer its output. ‚ÄúThis approach targets summarizers embedded in applications such as email clients, browser extensions, and productivity platforms,‚Äù the company
said
. ‚ÄúBy exploiting the trust users place in AI-generated summaries, the method covertly delivers malicious step-by-step instructions that can facilitate ransomware deployment.‚Äù
‚ÄúPrompt overdose is a manipulation technique that overwhelms an AI model‚Äôs context window with high-density, repeated content to control its output. By saturating the input with attacker-chosen text, legitimate context is pushed aside, and the model‚Äôs attention is consistently drawn back to the injected payload.‚Äù

<h2 id="how-leading-cisos-are-getting-budget-approval"><a id="article-7"></a>How Leading CISOs are Getting Budget Approval</h2>

<p>It‚Äôs budget season. Once again, security is being questioned, scrutinized, or deprioritized. If you‚Äôre a CISO or security leader, you‚Äôve likely found yourself explaining why your program matters, why a given tool or headcount is essential, and how the next breach is one blind spot away. But these arguments often fall short unless they‚Äôre framed in a way the board can understand and appreciate.</p>

<p>According to a
Gartner analysis
, 88% of Boards see cybersecurity as a business risk, rather than an IT issue, yet many security leaders still struggle to raise the profile of cybersecurity within the organization. For security issues to resonate amongst the Board you need to speak its language: business continuity, compliance, and cost impact. Below are some strategies to help you frame the conversation, transforming the technical and complex into clear business directives. Recognize the High Stakes
Cyber threats continue to evolve, from ransomware and supply chain attacks to advanced persistent threats.</p>

<p>Both large enterprises and mid-sized organizations are targets. The business impact of a breach is significant. It disrupts operations, damages reputation, and incurs substantial penalties. To avoid this, organizations must adopt a proactive approach like
continuous threat exposure management.</p>

<p>Ongoing validation through frequent, automated testing helps identify new attack vectors before they escalate. Align Security Strategy with Business Objectives
The board doesn‚Äôt approve security budgets based on fear or uncertainty. They want to see how your strategy protects revenue, maintains uptime, and supports compliance. That means translating technical goals into outcomes that align with business initiatives.</p>

<p>Define measurable KPIs like time to detect or remediate, and position your roadmap alongside upcoming projects like new system rollouts or merges and acquisitions. Build a Risk-Focused Framework
When you ask for more budget, you need to show prioritization. That starts by identifying and categorizing your core assets, customer data, proprietary systems, and infrastructure. Where possible, quantify what a breach could cost the business.</p>

<p>This helps define acceptable risk thresholds and guides investment. One of our customers, a US-based insurance provider, estimated that a breach of its policyholder database, which held a lot of customer PII, could cost the business more than $5 million in regulatory fines and lost revenue. This projection helped them prioritize vulnerabilities that could lead to this asset and validate its surrounding security controls. By focusing security efforts on high-value assets, they strengthened their security where it mattered most, and could show the board exactly why the investment was justified.</p>

<p>Use Industry Standards to Strengthen Your Case
Regulations and frameworks like ISO 27001, NIST, HIPAA, and PCI DSS are useful allies in making your case. They provide a baseline for good security hygiene and give leadership something familiar to anchor their decisions. But compliance doesn‚Äôt guarantee security. Use audit feedback to highlight gaps and demonstrate how validation adds a layer of real-world protection.</p>

<p>Jay Martin, CISO of COFCO International, shared in a recent Pentera-hosted panel that ‚Äúwe used to build budget requests around best practices, but what worked was showing where we were exposed‚Äîand how fast we could fix it.‚Äù
Craft a Business Case That Stands Up in the Boardroom
Security ROI is not just about cost savings. It is about avoiding losses, breaches, downtime, legal penalties, and brand damage. Automated security validation
shows early wins by uncovering exposures that traditional tools miss. These include misconfigurations, excessive permissions, and leaked credentials that are proven to be exploitable in your environment.</p>

<p>This proves the likelihood of an attack before it actually happens. This kind of evidence shows exactly where risk exists and how fast it can be fixed. It gives leadership a clear reason to expand the program and positions security as a business enabler, not just a cost center. Communicate with the Right Message for Each Audience
Boards want to understand how security decisions impact the business, whether that‚Äôs protecting revenue, avoiding regulatory penalties, or reducing the financial fallout of a breach.</p>

<p>Security teams need operational details. Bridging that gap is part of your role. Tailor your message for each group and use real examples where possible. Share stories of how organizations in similar industries were impacted by missteps or succeeded thanks to proactive investment.</p>

<p>Show how your plan creates alignment across departments and builds a culture of shared accountability. Stay Ahead of Emerging Threats with Real Testing
Cyberattacks evolve quickly. Threats that did not exist last quarter might be your biggest risk today. That is why security validation needs to be an ongoing practice.</p>

<p>Attackers are not waiting for your quarterly review cycle, and your defenses should not either. Frequent automated penetration tests, helps uncover blind spots across infrastructure, cloud environments, and partner systems. Continuous testing also allows you to show your board exactly how prepared you are for current threats, especially the high-profile ones that dominate headlines. Tracking how your organization holds up against these threats over time gives you a clear way to demonstrate progress.</p>

<p>This level of transparency builds confidence and helps shift the conversation from fear and uncertainty to readiness and measurable improvement. Avoid Budget Waste
Too many security investments turn into shelfware, not because the tools are bad, but because they‚Äôre underused, poorly integrated, or lack clear ownership. Make sure each solution maps to a specific need. Budget not only for licenses, but also for training and operational support.</p>

<p>Regular tool audits can help you streamline efforts, reduce redundancy, and focus spending where it delivers the most value. Finalize a Scalable, Defensible Budget Plan
The strongest budget plans break down spending by category: prevention, detection, response, and validation, and show how each area contributes to the larger picture. Show how your plan scales with the business so every decision continues to deliver value. To support expanding into new regions, a global manufacturing enterprise used automated security validation to establish best practices for hardening assets and configuring security controls.</p>

<p>Because they included continuous validation from the start, they avoided the high cost of manual testing and the operational strain of allocating extra resources. Most importantly, they maintained a strong security posture throughout their expansion by uncovering and remediating real exposures before attackers could exploit them. Takeaways: Prove Security‚Äôs Business Value
Security is no longer a cost center, it‚Äôs a growth enabler. When you continuously validate your controls, you shift the conversation from assumptions to evidence.</p>

<p>That evidence is what boards want to see. Use standards to your advantage. Show that you‚Äôre not just meeting expectations but actively reducing risk. And above all, keep making the case that smart, ongoing investment in cybersecurity protects the business today and builds resilience for tomorrow.</p>

GOAT guide
on how to communicate risk to the Board. It shows you how to use continuous validation, to not just defend your organization, but prove your security strategy is working. Found this article interesting? This article is a contributed piece from one of our valued partners.</p>

<h2 id="tor-based-cryptojacking-attack-expands-through-misconfigured-docker-apis"><a id="article-8"></a>TOR-Based Cryptojacking Attack Expands Through Misconfigured Docker APIs</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a variant of a recently disclosed campaign that abuses the TOR network for cryptojacking attacks targeting exposed Docker APIs. Akamai, which discovered the latest activity last month, said it‚Äôs designed to block other actors from accessing the Docker API from the internet. The findings build on a
prior report
from Trend Micro in late June 2025, which uncovered a malicious campaign that targeted exposed Docker instances to stealthily drop an XMRig cryptocurrency miner using a TOR domain for anonymity. ‚ÄúThis new strain seems to use similar tooling to the original, but may have a different end goal ‚Äì including possibly setting up the foundation of a complex botnet,‚Äù security researcher Yonatan Gilvarg
said
.</p>

<p>The attack chain essentially involves breaking into misconfigured Docker APIs to execute a new container based on the Alpine Docker image and mount the host file system into it. This is followed by the threat actors running a Base64-encoded payload to download a shell script downloader from a .onion domain. The script, besides altering SSH configurations to set up persistence, also installs other tools such as masscan, libpcap, libpcap-dev, zstd, and torsocks to conduct reconnaissance, contact a command-and-control (C2) server, and download a compressed binary from a second .onion domain. ‚ÄúThe first file that is downloaded is a dropper written in Go that includes the content it wants to drop, so it won‚Äôt communicate out to the internet,‚Äù Gilvarg explained.</p>

<p>‚ÄúExcept for dropping another binary file, it parses the utmp file to find who is currently logged in to the machine.‚Äù
Interestingly, the binary file‚Äôs source code includes an emoji to depict users who are signed in to the system. This indicates that the artifact may have been crafted using a large language model (LLM). The dropper also launches Masscan to scan the internet for open Docker API services at port 2375 and propagate the infection to those machines by repeating the same process of creating a container with the Base64 command. Furthermore, the binary includes checks for two more ports: 23 (
Telnet
) and 9222 (
remote debugging port
for Chromium browsers), although the functionality to spread via those ports is yet to be fully fleshed out.</p>

<p>The Telnet attack method entails using a set of known, default routers and device credentials to brute-force logins and exfiltrate successful sign-in attempts to a webhook[.]site endpoint with details about the destination IP address and victim authentication credentials. In the case of port 9222, the malware utilizes a Go library named chromedp to interact with the web browser. It has been previously weaponized by
North Korean threat actors
to communicate with C2 servers and even by
stealer malware
to bypass Chrome‚Äôs
app-bound encryption
, connect remotely to Chromium sessions, and siphon cookies and other private data. It then proceeds to attach to an existing session with the open remote port and ultimately send a POST to the same .onion domain used to retrieve the shell script downloader with information about the source IP address on which the malware is and the destination it found access to on port 9222.</p>

<p>The details are transmitted to an endpoint named ‚Äúhttpbot/add,‚Äù raising the possibility that devices with exposed remote debugging ports for Chrome/Chromium could be enlisted into a botnet for delivering additional payloads that can steal data or be used to conduct distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. ‚ÄúAs the malware only scans for port 2375, the logic for handling ports 23 and 9222 is currently unreachable and will not be executed,‚Äù Gilvarg said. ‚ÄúHowever, the implementation exists, which may indicate future capabilities.‚Äù
‚ÄúAttackers can gain significant control over systems affected by abused APIs. The importance of segmenting networks, limiting exposure of services to the internet, and securing default credentials cannot be overstated.</p>

<p>By adopting these measures, organizations can significantly reduce their vulnerability to such threats.‚Äù
Wiz Flags AWS SES Abuse Campaign
The disclosure comes as cloud security firm Wiz detailed an Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) campaign in May 2025 that leveraged compromised Amazon Web Services (AWS) access keys as a launchpad for a mass phishing attack. It‚Äôs currently not known how the keys were obtained. However, various methods exist by which an attacker can accomplish this: accidental public exposure in code repositories or through misconfigured assets, or theft from a developer workstation using stealer malware. ‚ÄúThe attacker used the compromised key to access the victim‚Äôs AWS environment, bypass SES‚Äôs built-in restrictions, verify new ‚Äòsender‚Äô identities, and methodically prepare and conduct a phishing operation,‚Äù Wiz researchers Itay Harel and Hila Ramati
said
.</p>

<p>Wiz, which further probed the phishing campaign in partnership with Proofpoint, said the emails targeted several organizations spanning multiple geographies and sectors, and employed tax-themed lures to redirect recipients to credential harvesting pages. ‚ÄúIf SES is configured in your account, attackers can send email from your verified domains,‚Äù Wiz cautioned. ‚ÄúBeyond brand damage, this enables phishing that looks like it came from you and can be used for spearphishing, fraud, data theft, or masquerading in business processes.‚Äù
When reached for comment, an AWS spokesperson told The Hacker News that ‚ÄúAs always, we encourage all customers to follow recommended
security guidance
to secure their accounts and prevent abuse. If anyone suspects that AWS resources are being used for abusive activity, they can report it using the
report abuse form

<h2 id="20-popular-npm-packages-with-2-billion-weekly-downloads-compromised-in-supply-chain-attack"><a id="article-9"></a>20 Popular npm Packages With 2 Billion Weekly Downloads Compromised in Supply Chain Attack</h2>

<p>Multiple npm packages have been compromised as part of a software supply chain attack after a maintainer‚Äôs account was compromised in a phishing attack. The attack targeted Josh Junon (aka
Qix
), who received an email message that mimicked npm (‚Äúsupport@npmjs[.]help‚Äù), urging them to update their update their two-factor authentication (2FA) credentials before September 10, 2025, by clicking on embedded link. The phishing page is said to have prompted the co-maintainer to enter their username, password, and two-factor authentication (2FA) token, only for it to be stolen likely by means of an adversary-in-the-middle (
AitM
) attack and used to publish the rogue version to the npm registry. The following 20 packages, which collectively attract over 2 billion weekly downloads, have been confirmed as affected as part of the incident -
ansi-regex@6.2.1
ansi-styles@6.2.2
backslash@0.2.1
chalk@5.6.1
chalk-template@1.1.1
color-convert@3.1.1
color-name@2.0.1
color-string@2.1.1
debug@4.4.2
error-ex@1.3.3
has-ansi@6.0.1
is-arrayish@0.3.3
proto-tinker-wc@1.8.7
supports-hyperlinks@4.1.1
simple-swizzle@0.2.3
slice-ansi@7.1.1
strip-ansi@7.1.1
supports-color@10.2.1
supports-hyperlinks@4.1.1
wrap-ansi@9.0.1
‚ÄúSorry everyone, I should have paid more attention,‚Äù Junon
said
in a post on Bluesky.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNot like me; have had a stressful week. Will work to get this cleaned up.‚Äù
An analysis of the obfuscated malware injected into the source code reveals that it‚Äôs designed to intercept cryptocurrency transaction requests and swap the destination wallet address with an attacker-controlled wallet that closely matches it by computing the
Levenshtein distance
. According to Aikido Security‚Äôs Charlie Eriksen, the payload
acts
as a browser-based interceptor that hijacks network traffic and application APIs to steal cryptocurrency assets by rewriting requests and responses. It‚Äôs currently not known who is behind the attack.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe payload begins by checking typeof window !== ‚Äòundefined‚Äô to confirm it is running in a browser,‚Äù Socket
said
. ‚ÄúIt then hooks into window.fetch, XMLHttpRequest, and window.ethereum.request, along with other wallet provider APIs.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis means the malware targets end users with connected wallets who visit a site that includes the compromised code. Developers are not inherently the target, but if they open an affected site in a browser and connect a wallet, they too become victims.‚Äù
Package ecosystems like npm and the Python Package Index (PyPI) remain recurring targets due to their popularity and broad reach within the developer community, with attackers abusing the trust associated with these platforms to push malicious payloads. Beyond publishing malicious packages directly, attackers have also employed techniques such as typosquatting or even exploiting AI-hallucinated dependencies ‚Äì called
slopsquatting
‚Äì to trick developers into installing malware.</p>

<p>The incident once indicates the need for exercising vigilance and hardening CI/CD pipelines and locking down dependencies. According to ReversingLabs‚Äô 2025
Software Supply Chain Security Report
, 14 of the 23 crypto-related malicious campaigns in 2024 targeted npm, with the remainder linked to PyPI. ‚ÄúWhat we are seeing unfold with the npm packages chalk and debug is an unfortunately common instance today in the software supply chain,‚Äù Ilkka Turunen, Field CTO at Sonatype, told The Hacker News. ‚ÄúThe malicious payload was focused on crypto theft, but this takeover follows a classic attack that is now established ‚Äì by taking over popular open source packages, adversaries can steal secrets, leave behind backdoors and infiltrate organizations.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt was not a random choice to target the developer of these packages.</p>

<p>Package takeovers are now a standard tactic for advanced persistent threat groups like Lazarus, because they know they can reach a large amount of the world‚Äôs developer population by infiltrating a single under-resourced project.‚Äù
Supply Chain Attack Broadens
According to
Socket
and
Sonatype
, the npm supply chain attack that compromised Qix has also managed to claim another high-profile maintainer, duckdb_admin, to distribute the same wallet-drainer malware. The list of affected packages is below -
@coveops/abi@2.0.1
@duckdb/duckdb-wasm@1.29.2
@duckdb/node-api@1.3.3
@duckdb/node-bindings@1.3.3
duckdb@1.3.3
prebid@10.9.1
prebid@10.9.2
prebid-universal-creative@1.17.3
Socket also told The Hacker News the incident has netted the attackers about $600, out of which $429 is on
Ethereum
and
$46.63
is on
Solana
. ‚ÄúThere are some more dollars and cents around threat actor‚Äôs ETH, BTC, TRON, BCH, LTC, and Solana wallets that bring the total to ~$600,‚Äù it added. Found this article interesting?</p>

<h2 id="45-previously-unreported-domains-expose-longstanding-salt-typhoon-cyber-espionage"><a id="article-10"></a>45 Previously Unreported Domains Expose Longstanding Salt Typhoon Cyber Espionage</h2>

<p>Threat hunters have discovered a set of previously unreported domains, some going back to May 2020, that are associated with China-linked threat actors Salt Typhoon and UNC4841. ‚ÄúThe domains date back several years, with the oldest registration activity occurring in May 2020, further confirming that the 2024 Salt Typhoon attacks were not the first activity carried out by this group,‚Äù Silent Push
said
in a new analysis shared with The Hacker News. The identified infrastructure, totaling 45 domains, has also been identified as sharing some level of overlap with another China-associated hacking group tracked as
UNC4841
, which is best known for its zero-day exploitation of a security flaw in Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG) appliances (CVE-2023-2868, CVSS score: 9.8). Salt Typhoon
, active since 2019, drew widespread attention last year for its targeting of telecommunications services providers in the U.S.</p>

<p>Believed to be operated by China‚Äôs Ministry of State Security (MSS), the threat cluster shares similarities with activities tracked as Earth Estries, FamousSparrow, GhostEmperor, and UNC5807. Silent Push said it identified three Proton Mail email addresses that were used to register as many as 16 domains with non-existent addresses. Further examination of the IP addresses related to the 45 domains has revealed that many of these domains pointed to high-density IP addresses. These refer to IP addresses to which a high number of hostnames currently point, or have pointed in the past.</p>

<p>Of those that pointed to low-density IP addresses, the earliest activity goes back to October 2021. The oldest domain identified as being part of China-backed cyber espionage campaigns is onlineeylity[.]com, registered on May 19, 2020, by a fake persona named Monica Burch, who claims to reside at 1294 Koontz Lane in Los Angeles, California. ‚ÄúAs such, we strongly urge any organization that believes itself to be at risk of Chinese espionage to search its DNS logs for the past five years for requests to any of the domains in our archive feed, or their subdomains,‚Äù Silent Push said. ‚ÄúIt would also be prudent to check for requests to any of the listed IP addresses, particularly during the time periods in which this actor operated them.‚Äù

<h2 id="github-account-compromise-led-to-salesloft-drift-breach-affecting-22-companies"><a id="article-11"></a>GitHub Account Compromise Led to Salesloft Drift Breach Affecting 22 Companies</h2>

<p>Salesloft has revealed that the data breach linked to its Drift application started with the compromise of its GitHub account. Google-owned Mandiant, which began an investigation into the incident, said the threat actor, tracked as UNC6395, accessed the Salesloft GitHub account from March through June 2025. It‚Äôs currently not known how the digital intruders gained access to the GitHub account. So far, 22 companies have
confirmed
they were impacted by a supply chain breach.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWith this access, the threat actor was able to download content from multiple repositories, add a guest user, and establish workflows,‚Äù Salesloft
said
in an updated advisory. The investigation also uncovered reconnaissance activities occurring between March 2025 and June 2025 in the Salesloft and Drift application environments. However, it emphasized there is no evidence of any activity beyond limited reconnaissance. In the next phase, the attackers accessed Drift‚Äôs Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment and obtained OAuth tokens for Drift customers‚Äô technology integrations, with the stolen OAuth tokens used to access data via Drift integrations.</p>

<p>Salesloft said it has isolated the Drift infrastructure, application, and code, and
taken the application offline
effective September 5, 2025, at 6 a.m. ET. It has also rotated credentials in the Salesloft environment and hardened the environment with improved segmentation controls between Salesloft and Drift applications. ‚ÄúWe are recommending that all third-party applications integrated with Drift via API key, proactively revoke the existing key for these applications,‚Äù it
added
.</p>

<p>As of September 7, 2025, at 5:51 p.m. UTC, Salesforce has restored the integration with the Salesloft platform after temporarily suspending it on August 28. This has been done in response to security measures and remediation steps implemented by Salesloft. ‚ÄúSalesforce has re-enabled integrations with Salesloft technologies, with the exception of any Drift app,‚Äù Salesforce
said
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúDrift will remain disabled until further notice as part of our continued response to the security incident.‚Äù

<h2 id="gpugate-malware-uses-google-ads-and-fake-github-commits-to-target-it-firms"><a id="article-12"></a>GPUGate Malware Uses Google Ads and Fake GitHub Commits to Target IT Firms</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have detailed a new sophisticated malware campaign that leverages paid ads on search engines like Google to deliver malware to unsuspecting users looking for popular tools like GitHub Desktop. While malvertising campaigns have become commonplace in recent years, the latest activity gives it a little twist of its own: Embedding a GitHub commit into a page URL containing altered links that point to attacker-controlled infrastructure. ‚ÄúEven when a link seems to point to a reputable platform such as GitHub, the underlying URL can be manipulated to resolve to a counterfeit site,‚Äù Arctic Wolf
said
in a report published last week. Exclusively targeting IT and software development companies within Western Europe since at least December 2024, the links within the rogue GitHub commit are designed to funnel users to a malicious download hosted on a lookalike domain (‚Äúgitpage[.]app‚Äù).</p>

<p>The activity was first detected on August 19, 2025. The first-stage malware delivered using poisoned search results is a bloated 128 MB Microsoft Software Installer (MSI) that, owing to its size, evades most existing online security sandboxes, while a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)-gated decryption routine keeps the payload encrypted on systems without a real GPU. The technique has been codenamed GPUGate. ‚ÄúSystems without proper GPU drivers are likely to be virtual machines (VMs), sandboxes, or older analysis environments that security researchers commonly use,‚Äù the cybersecurity company said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe executable [‚Ä¶] uses GPU functions to generate an encryption key for decrypting the payload, and it checks the GPU device name as it does this.‚Äù
Besides incorporating several garbage files as a filler and complicating analysis, it also terminates execution if the device name is less than 10 characters or GPU functions are not available. The attack subsequently entails the execution of a Visual Basic Script that launches a PowerShell script, which, in turn, runs with administrator privileges, adds Microsoft Defender exclusions, sets up scheduled tasks for persistence, and finally runs executable files extracted from a downloaded ZIP archive. The end goal is to facilitate information theft and deliver secondary payloads, while simultaneously evading detection. It‚Äôs assessed that the threat actors behind the campaign have native Russian language proficiency, given the presence of Russian language comments in the PowerShell script.</p>

<p>Further analysis of the threat actor‚Äôs domain has revealed it to be acting as a staging ground for Atomic macOS Stealer (
AMOS
), suggesting a cross-platform approach. ‚ÄúBy exploiting GitHub‚Äôs commit structure and leveraging Google Ads, threat actors can convincingly mimic legitimate software repositories and redirect users to malicious payloads ‚Äì bypassing both user scrutiny and endpoint defenses,‚Äù Arctic Wolf. The disclosure comes as Acronis detailed the ongoing evolution of a trojanized ConnectWise ScreenConnect campaign that uses the remote access software to drop
AsyncRAT
,
PureHVNC RAT
, and a custom PowerShell-based remote access trojan (RAT) on infected hosts in social engineering attacks aimed at U.S. organizations since March 2025.</p>

<p>The bespoke PowerShell RAT, executed by means of a JavaScript file downloaded from the cracked ScreenConnect server, provides some basic functionalities such as running programs, downloading and executing files, and a simple persistence mechanism. ‚ÄúAttackers now use a ClickOnce runner installer for ScreenConnect, which lacks embedded configuration and instead fetches components at runtime,‚Äù the security vendor
said
. ‚ÄúThis evolution makes traditional static detection methods less effective and complicates prevention, leaving defenders with few reliable options.‚Äù
