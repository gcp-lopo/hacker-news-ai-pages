<h2 id="45-previously-unreported-domains-expose-longstanding-salt-typhoon-cyber-espionage"><a id="article-1"></a>45 Previously Unreported Domains Expose Longstanding Salt Typhoon Cyber Espionage</h2>

<p>Threat hunters have discovered a set of previously unreported domains, some going back to May 2020, that are associated with China-linked threat actors Salt Typhoon and UNC4841. “The domains date back several years, with the oldest registration activity occurring in May 2020, further confirming that the 2024 Salt Typhoon attacks were not the first activity carried out by this group,” Silent Push
said
in a new analysis shared with The Hacker News. The identified infrastructure, totaling 45 domains, has also been identified as sharing some level of overlap with another China-associated hacking group tracked as
UNC4841
, which is best known for its zero-day exploitation of a security flaw in Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG) appliances (CVE-2023-2868, CVSS score: 9.8). Salt Typhoon
, active since 2019, drew widespread attention last year for its targeting of telecommunications services providers in the U.S.</p>

<p>Believed to be operated by China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS), the threat cluster shares similarities with activities tracked as Earth Estries, FamousSparrow, GhostEmperor, and UNC5807. Silent Push said it identified three Proton Mail email addresses that were used to register as many as 16 domains with non-existent addresses. Further examination of the IP addresses related to the 45 domains has revealed that many of these domains pointed to high-density IP addresses. These refer to IP addresses to which a high number of hostnames currently point, or have pointed in the past.</p>

<p>Of those that pointed to low-density IP addresses, the earliest activity goes back to October 2021. The oldest domain identified as being part of China-backed cyber espionage campaigns is onlineeylity[.]com, registered on May 19, 2020, by a fake persona named Monica Burch, who claims to reside at 1294 Koontz Lane in Los Angeles, California. “As such, we strongly urge any organization that believes itself to be at risk of Chinese espionage to search its DNS logs for the past five years for requests to any of the domains in our archive feed, or their subdomains,” Silent Push said. “It would also be prudent to check for requests to any of the listed IP addresses, particularly during the time periods in which this actor operated them.”

<h2 id="github-account-compromise-led-to-salesloft-drift-breach-affecting-22-companies"><a id="article-2"></a>GitHub Account Compromise Led to Salesloft Drift Breach Affecting 22 Companies</h2>

<p>Salesloft has revealed that the data breach linked to its Drift application started with the compromise of its GitHub account. Google-owned Mandiant, which began an investigation into the incident, said the threat actor, tracked as UNC6395, accessed the Salesloft GitHub account from March through June 2025. So far, 22 companies have
confirmed
they were impacted by a supply chain breach. “With this access, the threat actor was able to download content from multiple repositories, add a guest user, and establish workflows,” Salesloft
said
in an updated advisory.</p>

<p>The investigation also uncovered reconnaissance activities occurring between March 2025 and June 2025 in the Salesloft and Drift application environments. However, it emphasized there is no evidence of any activity beyond limited reconnaissance. In the next phase, the attackers accessed Drift’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment and obtained OAuth tokens for Drift customers’ technology integrations, with the stolen OAuth tokens used to access data via Drift integrations. Salesloft said it has isolated the Drift infrastructure, application, and code, and
taken the application offline
effective September 5, 2025, at 6 a.m.</p>

<p>ET. It has also rotated credentials in the Salesloft environment and hardened the environment with improved segmentation controls between Salesloft and Drift applications. “We are recommending that all third-party applications integrated with Drift via API key, proactively revoke the existing key for these applications,” it
added
. As of September 7, 2025, at 5:51 p.m.</p>

<p>UTC, Salesforce has restored the integration with the Salesloft platform after temporarily suspending it on August 28. This has been done in response to security measures and remediation steps implemented by Salesloft. “Salesforce has re-enabled integrations with Salesloft technologies, with the exception of any Drift app,” Salesforce
said
. “Drift will remain disabled until further notice as part of our continued response to the security incident.”

<h2 id="gpugate-malware-uses-google-ads-and-fake-github-commits-to-target-it-firms"><a id="article-3"></a>GPUGate Malware Uses Google Ads and Fake GitHub Commits to Target IT Firms</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have detailed a new sophisticated malware campaign that leverages paid ads on search engines like Google to deliver malware to unsuspecting users looking for popular tools like GitHub Desktop. While malvertising campaigns have become commonplace in recent years, the latest activity gives it a little twist of its own: Embedding a GitHub commit into a page URL containing altered links that point to attacker-controlled infrastructure. “Even when a link seems to point to a reputable platform such as GitHub, the underlying URL can be manipulated to resolve to a counterfeit site,” Arctic Wolf
said
in a report published last week. Exclusively targeted IT and software development companies within Western Europe since at least December 2024, the links within the rogue GitHub commit are designed to funnel users to a malicious download hosted on a lookalike domain (“gitpage[.]app”).</p>

<p>The first-stage malware delivered using poisoned search results is a bloated 128 MB Microsoft Software Installer (MSI) that, owing to its size, evades most existing online security sandboxes, while a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)-gated decryption routine keeps the payload encrypted on systems without a real GPU. The technique has been codenamed GPUGate. “Systems without proper GPU drivers are likely to be virtual machines (VMs), sandboxes, or older analysis environments that security researchers commonly use,” the cybersecurity company said. “The executable […] uses GPU functions to generate an encryption key for decrypting the payload, and it checks the GPU device name as it does this.”
Besides incorporating several garbage files as a filler and complicating analysis, it also terminates execution if the device name is less than 10 characters or GPU functions are not available.</p>

<p>The attack subsequently entails the execution of a Visual Basic Script that launches a PowerShell script, which, in turn, runs with administrator privileges, adds Microsoft Defender exclusions, sets up scheduled tasks for persistence, and finally runs executable files extracted from a downloaded ZIP archive. The end goal is to facilitate information theft and deliver secondary payloads, while simultaneously evading detection. It’s assessed that the threat actors behind the campaign have native Russian language proficiency, given the presence of Russian language comments in the PowerShell script. Further analysis of the threat actor’s domain has revealed it to be acting as a staging ground for Atomic macOS Stealer (
AMOS
), suggesting a cross-platform approach.</p>

<p>“By exploiting GitHub’s commit structure and leveraging Google Ads, threat actors can convincingly mimic legitimate software repositories and redirect users to malicious payloads – bypassing both user scrutiny and endpoint defenses,” Arctic Wolf. The disclosure comes as Acronis detailed the ongoing evolution of a trojanized ConnectWise ScreenConnect campaign that uses the remote access software to drop
AsyncRAT
,
PureHVNC RAT
, and a custom PowerShell-based remote access trojan (RAT) on infected hosts in social engineering attacks aimed at U.S. organizations since March 2025. The bespoke PowerShell RAT, executed by means of a JavaScript file downloaded from the cracked ScreenConnect server, provides some basic functionalities such as running programs, downloading and executing files, and a simple persistence mechanism.</p>

<p>“Attackers now use a ClickOnce runner installer for ScreenConnect, which lacks embedded configuration and instead fetches components at runtime,” the security vendor
said
. “This evolution makes traditional static detection methods less effective and complicates prevention, leaving defenders with few reliable options.”

<p>⚡ Threat of the Week
Salesloft to Take Drift Offline Amid Security Incident
— Salesloft announced that it has taken Drift temporarily offline effective September 5, 2025, at 6 a.m. ET, as multiple companies have been caught up in a far-reaching supply chain attack spree targeting the marketing software-as-a-service product, resulting in the mass theft of authentication tokens. “This will provide the fastest path forward to comprehensively review the application and build additional resiliency and security in the system to return the application to full functionality,” the company said. “As a result, the Drift chatbot on customer websites will not be available, and Drift will not be accessible.</p>

<p>To date, Cloudflare, Google Workspace, PagerDuty, Palo Alto Networks, Proofpoint, SpyCloud, Tanium, Tenable, and Zscaler have confirmed they were impacted by the hack. The activity has been attributed to a threat cluster tracked by Google and Cloudflare as UNC6395 and GRUB1, respectively. Zero Trust + AI: Thrive in the AI Era and Empower Your Workforce

Sitecore Flaw Under Active Exploitation in the Wild
— Unknown miscreants are exploiting a configuration vulnerability in multiple Sitecore products to achieve remote code execution via a publicly exposed key and deploy snooping malware on infected machines. The ViewState deserialization vulnerability, CVE-2025-53690, has been used to deploy malware and additional tooling geared toward internal reconnaissance and persistence across one or more compromised environments. The attackers targeted the “/sitecore/blocked.aspx” endpoint, which contains an unauthenticated ViewState form, with HTTP POST requests containing a crafted ViewState payload. Mandiant said it disrupted the intrusion midway, which prevented it from gaining further insights into the attack lifecycle and determining the attackers’ motivations.</p>

<p>Russian APT28 Deploys “NotDoor” Outlook Backdoor
— The Russian state-sponsored hacking group tracked as APT28 has been attributed to a new Microsoft Outlook backdoor called NotDoor (aka GONEPOSTAL) in attacks targeting multiple companies from different sectors in NATO member countries. NotDoor “is a VBA macro for Outlook designed to monitor incoming emails for a specific trigger word,” S2 Grupo’s LAB52 threat intelligence team said. “When such an email is detected, it enables an attacker to exfiltrate data, upload files, and execute commands on the victim’s computer.”
New GhostRedirector Actor Hacks 65 Windows Servers in Brazil, Thailand, and Vietnam
— A previously undocumented threat cluster dubbed GhostRedirector has managed to compromise at least 65 Windows servers primarily located in Brazil, Thailand, and Vietnam. The attacks, per Slovak cybersecurity company ESET, led to the deployment of a passive C++ backdoor called Rungan and a native Internet Information Services (IIS) module codenamed Gamshen.</p>

<p>The threat actor is believed to be active since at least August 2024. “While Rungan has the capability of executing commands on a compromised server, the purpose of Gamshen is to provide SEO fraud as-a-service, i.e., to manipulate search engine results, boosting the page ranking of a configured target website,” the company said. Google Fixes 2 Actively Exploited Android Flaws
— Google has shipped security updates to address 120 security flaws in its Android operating system as part of its monthly fixes for September 2025, including two issues that it said have been exploited in targeted attacks. One of them, CVE-2025-38352, is a privilege escalation vulnerability in the upstream Linux Kernel component.</p>

<p>The second shortcoming is a privilege escalation flaw in Android Runtime (CVE-2025-48543). Benoît Sevens of Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) has been credited with discovering and reporting the upstream Linux Kernel flaw, suggesting that it may have been abused as part of targeted spyware attacks. Threat Actors Claim to Weaponize HexStrike AI in Real-World Attacks
— Threat actors are attempting to leverage a newly released artificial intelligence (AI) offensive security tool called HexStrike AI to exploit recently disclosed security flaws. “This marks a pivotal moment: a tool designed to strengthen defenses has been claimed to be rapidly repurposed into an engine for exploitation, crystallizing earlier concepts into a widely available platform driving real-world attacks,” Check Point said.</p>

<p>Iranian Hackers Linked to Attacks Targeting European Embassies
— An Iran-nexus group conducted a “coordinated” and “multi-wave” spear-phishing campaign targeting the embassies and consulates in Europe and other regions across the world. The activity has been attributed by Israeli cybersecurity company Dream to Iranian-aligned operators connected to broader offensive cyber activity undertaken by a group known as Homeland Justice. “Emails were sent to multiple government recipients worldwide, disguising legitimate diplomatic communication,” the company said. “Evidence points toward a broader regional espionage effort aimed at diplomatic and governmental entities during a time of heightened geopolitical tension.”

<p>📰 Around the Cyber World
New AI Waifu RAT Disclosed
— Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a potent Windows-based remote access trojan (RAT) called AI Waifu RAT that uses the power of a large language model to pass commands. “A local agent runs on the victim’s machine, listening for commands on a fixed port,” a researcher by the name ryingo
said
. “These commands, originating from the LLM, are passed through a web UI and sent to the local agent as plaintext HTTP requests.” The malware specifically targets LLM role-playing communities, capitalizing on their interest in the technology to offer AI characters the ability to read local files for “personalized role-playing” and direct “Arbitrary Code Execution” capabilities. DoJ: “Not all heroes wear capes.</p>

<p>Some have YouTube channels”
— The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) said two YouTube channels named Scammer Payback and Trilogy Media played a crucial role in unmasking and identifying members of a giant scam network that stole more than $65 million from senior citizens. The 28 alleged members of the Chinese organized crime ring allegedly used call centers based in India to call the elderly, posing as government officials, bank employees, and tech support agents. “Once connected, the scammers used scripted lies and psychological manipulation to gain the victims’ trust and often remote access to their computers,” the DoJ
said
.</p>

<p>“The most common scheme involved convincing victims they had received a mistaken refund and pressuring – or threatening – them to return the supposed excess funds via wire transfer, cash, or gift cards.” Those sending cash were instructed to use overnight or express couriers, addressing packages to fake names tied to false IDs. These were sent to short-term rentals in the U.S. used by conspirators, including the indicted defendants, to collect the fraud proceeds. The network has operated out of Southern California since 2019.</p>

<p>Analysis of BadSuccessor Patch
— Microsoft, as part of its August 2025 Patch Tuesday update, addressed a security flaw called
BadSuccessor
(CVE-2025-53779) that abused a loophole in dMSA, causing the Key Distribution Center (KDC) to treat a dMSA linked to any account in Active Directory as the successor during authentication. As a result, an attacker could create a dMSA in an Organizational Unit (OU) and link it to any target — even domain controllers, Domain Admins, Protected Users, or accounts marked “sensitive and cannot be delegated” – and compromise them. An analysis of the patch has revealed that patch enforcement was implemented in the KDC’s validation. “The attribute can still be written, but the KDC won’t honor it unless the pairing looks like a legitimate migration,” Akamai security researcher Yuval Gordon
said
.</p>

<p>“Although the vulnerability can be patched, BadSuccessor still lives on as a technique; that is, the KDC’s verification removes the pre-patch escalation path, but doesn’t mitigate the entire problem. Because the patch didn’t introduce any protection to the link attribute, an attacker can still inherit another account by linking a controlled dMSA and a target account.”
Phishers Pivot to Ramp and Dump Scheme
— Cybercriminal groups advertising sophisticated phishing kits that convert stolen card data into mobile wallets have
shifted their focus
to targeting customers of brokerage services and using compromised brokerage accounts to manipulate the prices of foreign stocks as part of what’s called a ramp and dump scheme. Popular C2 Frameworks Exploited by Threat Actors
— Sliver, Havoc, Metasploit, Mythic, Brute Ratel C4, and Cobalt Strike (in that order) have emerged as the most frequently used command-and-control (C2) frameworks in malicious attacks in Q2 2025, per data from Kaspersky. “Attackers are increasingly customizing their C2 agents to automate malicious activities and hinder detection,” the company
said
.</p>

<p>The development came as the majority (53%) of attributed vulnerability exploits in the first half of 2025 were conducted by state-sponsored actors for strategic, geopolitical purposes, according to
Recorded Future’s Insikt Group
. In all, 23,667 CVEs were published in H1 2025, a 16% increase compared to H1 2024. Attackers actively exploited 161 vulnerabilities, and 42% of those exploited flaws had public PoC exploits. Fake PDF Converters Deliver JSCoreRunner macOS Malware
— Apps posing as PDF converters are being used to deliver malware called JSCoreRunner.</p>

<p>Once downloaded from sites like fileripple[.]com, the malware establishes connections with a remote server and hijacks a user’s Chrome browser by modifying its search engine settings to default to a fraudulent search provider, thereby tracking user searches and redirecting them to bogus sites, further exposing them to data and financial theft, per
Mosyle
. The attack unfolds over two stages: The initial package (whose signature has since been revoked by Apple), which deploys an unsigned secondary payload from the same domain that, in turn, executes the main malicious payload. Copeland Releases Fixes for Frostbyte10 Flaws
— American tech company Copeland has
released
a firmware update to fix ten vulnerabilities in Copeland E2 and E3 controllers. The chips are used to manage energy efficiency inside HVAC and refrigeration systems.</p>

<p>The ten vulnerabilities have been collectively named Frostbyte10. “The flaws discovered could have allowed unauthorized actors to remotely manipulate parameters, disable systems, execute remote code, or gain unauthorized access to sensitive operational data,” Armis said. “When combined and exploited, these vulnerabilities can result in unauthenticated remote code execution with root privileges.” The most severe of the flaws is CVE-2025-6519, a case of a default admin user “ONEDAY” with a daily generated password that can be predictably generated. In a hypothetical attack scenario, an attacker could chain CVE-2025-6519 and CVE-2025-52549 with CVE-2025-52548, which can enable SSH and Shellinabox access via a hidden API call, to facilitate remote execution of arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.</p>

<p>Over 1,000 Ollama Servers Exposed
— A new study from Cisco found over 1,100 exposed Ollama servers, with approximately 20% actively hosting models susceptible to unauthorized access. Out of the 1,139 exposed servers, 214 were found to be actively hosting and responding to requests with live models—accounting for approximately 18.8% of the total scanned population, with Mistral and LLaMA representing the most frequently encountered deployments. The remaining 80% of detected servers, while reachable via unauthenticated interfaces, did not have any models instantiated. Although dormant, these servers remain susceptible to exploitation via unauthorized model uploads or configuration manipulation.</p>

<p>The findings “highlight the urgent need for security baselines in LLM deployments and provide a practical foundation for future research into LLM threat surface monitoring,” the company
said
. Tycoon Phishing Kit Evolves
— The Tycoon phishing kit has been updated to support URL-encoding techniques to hide malicious links embedded in fake voicemail messages to bypass email security checks. Attackers have also been observed using the Redundant Protocol Prefix technique for similar reasons. “This involves crafting a URL that is only partially hyperlinked or that contains invalid elements — such as two ‘https’ or no ‘//’ — to hide the real destination of the link while ensuring the active part looks benign and legitimate and doesn’t arouse suspicion among targets or their browser controls,” Barracuda
said
.</p>

<p>“Another trick is using the ‘@’ symbol in a web address. Everything before the ‘@’ is treated as ‘user info’ by browsers, so attackers put something that looks reputable and trustworthy in this part, such as ‘office365.’ The link’s actual destination comes after the ‘@.’”
U.S. State Department Offers Up to $10M for Russian Hackers
— The U.S. Department of State is
offering
a bounty of
up to $10 million
for information on three Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) officers involved in cyberattacks targeting U.S.</p>

<p>critical infrastructure organizations on behalf of the Russian government. The three individuals, Marat Valeryevich Tyukov, Mikhail Mikhailovich Gavrilov, and Pavel Aleksandrovich Akulov, are part of the FSB’s Center 16 or Military Unit 71330, which is
tracked
as Berserk Bear, Blue Kraken, Crouching Yeti, Dragonfly, Koala Team, and Static Tundra. They have been accused of targeting 500 energy companies in 135 countries. In March 2022, the three FBS officers were also
charged
for their involvement in a campaign that took place between 2012 and 2017, targeting U.S.</p>

<p>government agencies. XWorm Malware Uses Sneaky Methods to Evade Detection
— A new XWorm malware campaign is using deceptive and intricate methods to evade detection and increase the success rate of the malware. “The XWorm malware infection chain has evolved to include additional techniques beyond traditional email-based attacks,” Trellix
said
. “While email and .LNK files remain common initial access vectors, XWorm now also leverages legitimate-looking .EXE filenames to disguise itself as harmless applications, exploiting user and system trust.” The attack chain uses LNK files to initiate a complex infection.</p>

<p>Executing the .LNK triggers malicious PowerShell commands that deliver a .TXT file and download a deceptively-named binary called “discord.exe.” The executable then drops “main.exe” and “system32.exe,” with the latter being the XWorm malware payload. “Main.exe,” on the other hand, is responsible for disabling the Windows Firewall and checking for the presence of -third-party security applications. XWorm, besides meticulously conducting reconnaissance to acquire a comprehensive profile of the machine, runs anti-analysis checks to ascertain the presence of a virtualized environment, and, if so, ceases execution. It also incorporates backdoor functionality by contacting an external server to execute commands, shut down the system, download files, open URLs, and launch DDoS attacks.</p>

<p>Recent campaigns distributing the malware through a new crypter-as-a-service offering known as
Ghost Crypt
. “Ghost Crypt delivers a zipped archive to the victim containing a PDF Reader application, a DLL, and a PDF file,” Kroll
said
. “When the user opens the PDF, the malicious DLL is side-loaded, initiating the malware execution.” The PDF Reader application is HaiHaiSoft PDF Reader, which is known to have a DLL side-loading vulnerability, previously exploited to deliver Remcos RAT, NodeStealer, and PureRAT. 2 E-Crime Groups Use Stealerium Stealer in New Campaigns
— Two different cybercriminal groups, TA2715 and TA2536, both of which favored Snake Keylogger, have conducted phishing campaigns in May 2025, delivering an open-source information stealer called Stealerium (or variants of it).</p>

<p>“The observed emails impersonated many different organizations, including charitable foundations, banks, courts, and document services, which are common themes in e-crime lures,” Proofpoint
said
. “Subject lines typically conveyed urgency or financial relevance, including ‘Payment Due,’ ‘Court Summons,’ and ‘Donation Invoice.’”
Czechia Issues Warning Against Chinese Tech in Critical Infrastructure
— NÚKIB, the Czech Republic’s cybersecurity agency, has issued a bulletin regarding the threat posed by technology systems that transfer data to, or are remotely managed from, China. “Current critical infrastructure systems are increasingly dependent on storing and processing data in cloud repositories and on network connectivity enabling remote operation and updates,” the agency
warned
. “In practice, this means that technology solution providers can significantly influence the operation of critical infrastructure and/or access important data, making trust in the reliability of the provider absolutely crucial.”
Google Chrome 140 Gains Support for Cookie Prefixes
— Google has released version 140 of its Chrome browser with support for a new security feature designed to protect server-set cookies from client-side modifications.</p>

<p>Called a
cookie prefix
, it involves adding a piece of text before the names of a browser’s cookies. “In some cases, it’s important to distinguish on the server side between cookies set by the server and those set by the client. One such case involves cookies normally always set by the server,” Google
said
. “However, unexpected code (such as an XSS exploit, a malicious extension, or a commit from a confused developer) might set them on the client.</p>

<p>This proposal adds a signal that lets servers make such a distinction. More specifically, it defines the __Http and __HostHttp prefixes, which ensure a cookie is not set on the client side using script.”
New Ransomware Strains Detailed
— A new ransomware group called
LunaLock
has hacked an art-commissioning portal called Artists&amp;Clients and is extorting its owners and artists by threatening to submit the stolen artwork to train artificial intelligence (AI) models unless it pays a $50,000 ransom. Another newly observed ransomware crew is
Obscura
, which was first observed by Huntress on August 29, 2025. The Go-based ransomware variant attempts to terminate over 120 processes commonly tied to security tools like Microsoft Defender, CrowdStrike, and SentinelOne.</p>

<p>E.U. Court Backs Data Transfer Deal Agreed by U.S. and E.U. — The General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union has
dismissed
a
lawsuit
that sought to annul the E.U.</p>

<p>and U.S. Data Privacy Framework. The court ruled that the new treaty and the US adequately safeguard the personal data of E.U. citizens.</p>

<p>The lawsuit alleged that the U.S. Data Protection Review Court (DPRC), which is housed inside the Department of Justice and has been historically seen as a bulwark for checking U.S. data surveillance activities, is not sufficiently independent and does not adequately shield Europeans from bulk data collection by U.S. intelligence agencies.</p>

<p>Microsoft to Move to Phase 2 of MFA Enforcement in October 2025
— Microsoft said it has been enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Azure Portal sign-ins across all tenants since March 2025. “We are proud to announce that multi-factor enforcement for Azure Portal sign-ins was rolled out for 100% of Azure tenants in March 2025,” the company
said
. “By enforcing MFA for Azure sign-ins, we aim to provide you with the best protection against cyber threats as part of Microsoft’s commitment to enhancing security for all customers, taking one step closer to a more secure future.” The next phase of MFA requirement is scheduled to start October 1, 2025, mandating the use of MFA for users performing Azure resource management operations through Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI), Azure PowerShell, Azure Mobile App, REST APIs, Azure Software Development Kit (SDK) client libraries, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools. Surge in Scanning Activity Targeting Cisco ASA
— GreyNoise said it
detected
two scanning surges against Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) devices on August 22 and 26, 2025, with the first wave originating from over 25,100 IP addresses mainly located in Brazil, Argentina, and the U.S.</p>

<p>The second spike repeated ASA probing, with subsets hitting both IOS Telnet/SSH and ASA software personas. The activity targeted the U.S., the U.K., and Germany. LinkedIn Expands Verification to Combat Job-Themed Scams
— Microsoft-owned professional social network
unveiled
new measures to strengthen trust and ensure that users are interacting with people who “they say they are.” This includes verified Premium Company Pages, requiring recruiters to verify their workplace on their profile, and workplace verification requirements for high-level titles such as Executive Director, Managing Director, and Vice President to tackle impersonation. The changes are an effort to prevent scammers from posing as company employees or recruiters and reaching out to prospective targets with fake job opportunities – a technique
pioneered
by North Korean hackers.</p>

<p>Hotelier Accounts Targeted in Malvertising and Phishing Campaign
— A large-scale phishing campaign has impersonated at least 13 service providers that specialize in hotels and vacation rentals. “In these attacks, targeted users are lured to highly deceptive phishing sites using malicious search engine advertisements, particularly sponsored ads on platforms like Google Search,” Okta
said
. “The attacks leverage convincing fake login pages and social engineering tactics to bypass security controls and exploit user trust.” It’s assessed that the end goal of the campaign is to compromise accounts for cloud-based property management and guest messaging platforms. DamageLib Emerges After XSS Forum Takedown
— A new cybercrime forum called DamageLib has grown dramatically, attracting over 33,000 users following the
arrest of XSS[.]is admin
Toha back in July 2025.</p>

<p>While XSS remains online, speculations are abound that it could be a law enforcement honeypot, breeding mistrust among cybercriminals. “Exploit forum traffic surged almost 24% during the XSS turmoil as actors sought alternatives, while XSS visits plummeted,” KELA
said
. “As of August 27, 2025, DamageLib counted 33,487 users – nearly 66% of XSS’s 50,853 members. But engagement lagged: only 248 threads and 3,107 posts in its first month, compared to over 14,400 messages on XSS in the month before the seizure.”
GhostAction Supply Chain Attack Steals 3,325 Secrets
— A massive
supply chain attack
dubbed GhostAction has allowed attackers to inject a malicious GitHub workflow named “Github Actions Security” to exfiltrate 3,325 secrets, including PyPI, npm, and DockerHub tokens via HTTP POST requests to a remote attacker-controlled endpoint (“bold-dhawan.45-139-104-115.plesk[.]page”).</p>

<p>The activity affected 327 GitHub users across 817 repositories. New Campaign Abuses Simplified AI to Steal Microsoft 365 Credentials
— A new phishing campaign has been observed hosting fake pages under the legitimate Simplified AI domain in a bid to evade detection and blend in with regular enterprise traffic. “By impersonating an executive from a global pharmaceutical distributor, the threat actors delivered a password-protected PDF that appeared legitimate,” Cato Networks
said
. “Once opened, the file redirected the victim to Simplified AI’s website, but instead of generating content, the site became a launchpad to a fake Microsoft 365 login portal designed to harvest enterprise credentials.”
Japan, South Korea, and the U.S.</p>

<p>Take Aim at North Korean IT Worker Scam
— Japan, South Korea, and the U.S. joined hands to fight against the
growing threat
of North Korean threat actors posing as IT workers to embed themselves in organizations throughout Asia and globally and generate revenue to fund its unlawful weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile programs. “They take advantage of existing demands for advanced IT skills to obtain freelance employment contracts from an expanding number of target clients throughout the world, including in North America, Europe, and East Asia,” the countries
said
in a joint statement. “North Korean IT workers themselves are also highly likely to be involved in malicious cyber activities, particularly in the blockchain industries.</p>

<p>Hiring, supporting, or outsourcing work to North Korean IT workers increasingly poses serious risks, ranging from theft of intellectual property, data, and funds to reputational harm and legal consequences.”
New AI-Powered Android Vulnerability Discovery and Validation Tool
— Computer scientists affiliated with Nanjing University in China and The University of Sydney in Australia said that they’ve developed an AI vulnerability identification system called A2 that emulates the way human bug hunters go about discovering flaws, marking a step forward for automated security analysis. According to the
study
, A2 “validates Android vulnerabilities through two complementary phases: (i) Agentic Vulnerability Discovery, which reasons about application security by combining semantic understanding with traditional security tools; and (ii) Agentic Vulnerability Validation, which systematically validates vulnerabilities across Android’s multi-modal attack surface-UI interactions, inter-component communication, file system operations, and cryptographic computations.” A2 builds upon
A1
, an agentic system that transforms any LLM into an end-to-end exploit generator. Spotify DM Feature Carries Doxxing Risks
— Music streaming service Spotify, last month,
announced
a new messaging feature for sharing music with friends. But
reports
are now emerging on Reddit that it’s surfacing as “suggested friends,” people with whom users may have shared Spotify links in the past on other social media platforms, potentially revealing their real names in the process.</p>

<p>This is made possible by means of a unique “si” parameter in Spotify links that serves as referral information. Spear-Phishing Campaign Targets C-Suite for Credential Theft
— A sophisticated spear-phishing campaign has targeted senior employees, particularly those in C-Suite and leadership positions, to steal their credentials using email messages with salary-themed lures or fake OneDrive document-sharing notifications. “Actors behind this campaign are leveraging tailored emails that impersonate internal HR communications, via a shared document in OneDrive, to trick recipients into entering corporate credentials,” Stripe OLT
said
. “Emails are sent via Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) infrastructure.</p>

<p>The actor is rotating between many sending domains and subdomains to evade detection.” As many as 80 domains have been identified as part of this campaign. Attackers Attempt to Exploit WDAC Technique
— In December 2024, researchers Jonathan Beierle and Logan Goins
demonstrated
a novel technique that leverages a malicious Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policy to block security solutions such as Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) sensors following a system reboot using a custom tool codenamed
Krueger
. Since then, it has
emerged
that threat actors have incorporated the method into their attack arsenal to disable security solutions using WDAC policies. It has also led to the discovery of a new malware strain dubbed DreamDemon that uses WDAC to neutralize antivirus programs.</p>

<p>It contains an embedded WDAC policy, which is then dropped onto disk and hidden,” Beierle
said
. “In certain cases, DreamDemon will also change the time that the policy was created in an attempt to avoid detection.”
New NBMiner Cryptojacking Malware Detected
— Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new campaign that leverages a PowerShell script to drop an AutoIt loader used to deliver a cryptocurrency miner called NBMiner from an external server. Initial access to the system is accomplished by means of a drive-by compromise. “The program includes several evasion measures,” Darktrace
said
.</p>

<p>“It performs anti-sandboxing by sleeping to delay analysis and terminates sigverif.exe (File Signature Verification). It checks for installed antivirus products and continues only when Windows Defender is the sole protection. It also verifies whether the current user has administrative rights. If not, it attempts a User Account Control (UAC) bypass via Fodhelper to silently elevate and execute its payload without prompting the user.”
New Campaign Uses Custom GPTs for Brand Impersonation and Phishing
— Threat actors are abusing custom features on trusted AI platforms like OpenAI ChatGPT to create malicious “customer support” chatbots that impersonate legitimate brands.</p>

<p>These custom GPTs are surfaced on Google Search results, tricking users into taking malicious actions under the guise of a helpful chatbot, underscoring how
AI tools can be misused
within a broader social engineering chain. “This method introduces a new threat vector: platform-hosted social engineering through trusted AI interfaces,” Doppel
said
. “Several publicly available Custom GPTs have been observed impersonating well-known companies.” The attacks can lead to theft of sensitive information, malware delivery, and damage the reputation of legitimate brands. The development is
part of a larger trend
where cybercriminals abuse AI tools, including impersonation fraud via deepfakes, AI-assisted scam call centers, AI-powered mailers and spam tools, malicious tool development, and unrestricted and self-hosted generative AI chatbots that can craft phishing kits, fake websites; create content for romance or investment scams; develop malware; and assist with vulnerability reconnaissance and exploit chains.</p>

<p>McDonald’s Poland Fined for Leaking Personal Data
— Poland’s data protection agency
fined
McDonald’s Poland nearly €4 million for leaking employee personal data, violating GDPR data privacy protections. The incident occurred at a partner company that managed employee work schedules. Personal data such as names, passport numbers, positions, and work schedules were left exposed on the internet through an open directory. This is the second-largest GDPR fine handed out by Polish authorities after fining the country’s postal service €6.3 million
earlier this year
.</p>

<p>In related news, vulnerabilities in the McDonald’s chatbot recruitment platform McHire exposed over 64 million job applications across the U.S., security researchers Ian Carroll and Sam Curry
discovered
. The chatbot was created by Paradox.ai, which did not remove the default credentials for a test account (username 123456, password 123456) and failed to secure an endpoint that allowed access to the chat interactions of every applicant. There is
no evidence
that the test account was ever exploited in a malicious context. A separate set of security issues has also been discovered in the fast-food giant’s partner and employee portals that exposed sensitive data such as API keys and enabled unauthorized access to make changes to a franchise owner’s website.</p>

<p>The issues, according to
BobdaHacker
, have since been patched. New Influence Operations Discovered
— Cybersecurity company Recorded Future flagged two large-scale, state-aligned influence operation networks supporting India and Pakistan during the India-Pakistan conflict of April and May 2025. These influence networks have been codenamed Hidden Charkha (pro-India) and Khyber Defender (pro-Pakistan). “These networks are very likely motivated by patriotism and are almost certainly aligned with India’s and Pakistan’s domestic and foreign policy objectives, respectively,” Recorded Future
said
.</p>

<p>“Each network consistently attempted to frame India or Pakistan, respectively, as maintaining superior technological and military capabilities – and therefore the implied ability for each respective country to exercise tactical restraint – as proof of having the moral high ground, and hence having domestic and international support.” Both the campaigns were largely unsuccessful in shaping public opinion, given the lack of organic engagement on social media. A second influence operation involves multiple Russia-linked networks, such as Operation Overload, Operation Undercut, Foundation to Battle Injustice, and Portal Kombat, seeking to destabilize the elections and derail Moldova’s European Union (E.U.) accession. Besides attempting to frame the current Moldova leadership as corrupt and counter to Moldova’s interests, the activity portrays “Moldova’s further integration with the E.U. as disastrous for its economic future and sovereignty, and Moldova as a whole as at odds with European standards and values.” The campaign has not achieved any substantial success in shaping public opinion, Recorded Future
added
.</p>

<p>Massive IPTV Piracy Network Uncovered
— A large Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) piracy network
spanning
more than 1,100 domains and over 10,000 IP addresses has been discovered hosting pirated content, illegally restreaming licensed channels, and engaging in subscription fraud. Active for several years, more than 20 major brands have been affected, including: Prime Video, Bein Sports, Disney Plus, NPO Plus, Formula 1, HBO, Viaplay, Videoland, Discovery Channel, Ziggo Sports, Netflix, Apple TV, Hulu, NBA, RMC Sport, Premier League, Champions League, Sky Sports, NHL, WWE, and UFC. Silent Push said it identified two companies involved in profiting from hosting pirated content – XuiOne and Tiyansoft. XuiOne is believed to share connections with
Stalker_Portal
, another well-known open-source IPTV project that has been around since 2013.</p>

<p>These services are advertised in the form of Android apps, with the domains distributed via Facebook groups and Imgur. The cybersecurity firm also identified one individual, Nabi Neamati of Herat, Afghanistan, as a central figure in its operations. Security Analysis of WhatsApp Message Summarization
— NCC Group has
published
an in-depth analysis of WhatsApp’s
AI-powered Message Summarization feature
, which was announced by the messaging platform in June 2025. In all, the assessment discovered 21 findings, 16 of which were fixed by WhatsApp.</p>

<p>This included three notable weaknesses: The hypervisor could have assigned network interfaces to the CVM through which private data could be exfiltrated; any old Confidential Virtual Machine (CVM) image with known vulnerabilities could have been indefinitely used by an attacker; and the ability to serve malicious key configurations to WhatsApp clients could have allowed Meta to violate privacy and non-targetability assurances. Indirect Prompt Injection via Log Files
— Large language models (LLMs) used in a security context can be
deceived
by specially crafted events and log files injected with hidden prompts to execute malicious actions when they are parsed by AI agents. 🎥 Cybersecurity Webinars
From Blind Spots to Clarity: Why Code-to-Cloud Visibility Defines Modern AppSec
— Most security programs know their risks—but not where they truly begin or how they spread. That gap between code and cloud is costing teams time, ownership, and resilience.</p>

<p>This webinar shows how code-to-cloud visibility closes that gap by giving developers, DevOps, and security a shared view of vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and runtime exposure. The result? Less noise, faster fixes, and stronger protection for the applications your business depends on. Shadow AI Agents: The Hidden Risk Driving Enterprise Blind Spots
— AI Agents are no longer futuristic—they’re already embedded in your workflows, processes, and platforms.</p>

<p>The problem? Many of them are invisible to governance, fueled by unchecked non-human identities that create a growing attack surface. Shadow AI doesn’t just add complexity; it multiplies risk with every click. This webinar unpacks where these agents are hiding, how to spot them before attackers do, and what steps you can take to bring them under control without slowing innovation.</p>

<p>AI + Quantum 2.0: The Double Disruption Security Leaders Can’t Ignore
— The next cybersecurity crisis won’t come from AI or quantum alone—it will come from their convergence. As quantum breakthroughs accelerate and AI drives automation at scale, the attack surface for sensitive industries is expanding faster than most defenses can keep up. This panel brings together leading voices from research, government, and industry to unpack what Quantum 2.0 means for security, why quantum-safe cryptography and AI resilience must go hand-in-hand, and how decision-makers can start building trust and resilience before adversaries weaponize these technologies. 🔧 Cybersecurity Tools
MeetC2
— It is a clever proof-of-concept C2 framework that uses Google Calendar—yes, the same calendar your team uses every day—as a hidden command channel between an operator and a compromised endpoint.</p>

<p>By polling for events and embedding commands into calendar items via Google’s trusted APIs (oauth2.googleapis.com, www.googleapis.com), it shows how legitimate SaaS platforms can be repurposed for covert operations. Security teams can use MeetC2 in controlled purple-team exercises to sharpen detection logic around unusual calendar API usage, validate logging and telemetry effectiveness, and fine-tune safeguards against stealthy cloud-based C2 strategies. In short, it equips defenders with a lightweight, highly relevant testbed to simulate and proactively defend against next-gen adversarial tradecraft. thermoptic
– It is an advanced HTTP proxy that cloaks low-level clients like curl to appear indistinguishable from a full Chrome/Chromium browser at the network fingerprinting layer.</p>

<p>Modern WAFs and anti-bot systems increasingly rely on JA4+ signatures—tracking TLS, HTTP, TCP, and certificate fingerprints—to block scraping tools or detect when users switch from browsers to scripts. By routing requests through a containerized Chrome instance, thermoptic ensures fingerprints match real browsers byte-for-byte, even across multiple layers. For defenders, this is a powerful way to test detection pipelines against sophisticated evasion tactics, validate JA4+ logging visibility, and explore how adversaries might blend into legitimate browser traffic. For ethical researchers and red teams, thermoptic offers a realistic, open-source platform to simulate stealthy scraping or covert traffic—helping security teams move from theory to resilience in the fingerprinting arms race.</p>

<p>🔒 Tip of the Week
Lock Down Your Router Before Hackers Ever Get a Foot in the Door —
Most people think of router security as just “change the password” or “disable UPnP.” But attackers are getting far more creative: from rerouting internet traffic through fake BGP paths, to hijacking cloud services that talk directly to your router. The best defense? A layered approach that closes those doors before compromise happens. Here are 3 advanced but practical moves you can start today:
Protect Your Internet Route with RPKI
Why it matters:
Attackers sometimes hijack internet routes (BGP attacks) to spy on or reroute your traffic.</p>

<p>Try this:
Even if you’re not running a big enterprise, you can check if your ISP supports RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure) using the free
Is BGP Safe Yet? tool. If your provider isn’t secured, ask them about RPKI. Use Short-Lived Access Keys Instead of Static Passwords
Why it matters:
A single stolen router password can let attackers in for years.</p>

<p>Try this:
If your router supports it (OpenWRT, pfSense, MikroTik), set up SSH access with keys instead of passwords. For home or small office users, tools like
YubiKey
can generate one-time login tokens, so even if your PC is hacked, the router stays safe. Control Who Can Even Knock on the Door
Why it matters:
Most router compromises happen because attackers can reach the management port from the internet. Try this:
Instead of leaving management open, use Single Packet Authorization (SPA) with a free tool like
fwknop
.</p>

<p>It hides your router’s management ports until you send a secret “knock,” making your router invisible to scanners. Think of your router as the “front door to your digital house.” With these tools, you’re not just locking it — you’re making sure attackers don’t even know where the door is, and even if they do, the key changes every day. Conclusion
That wraps up this week’s briefing, but the story never really ends. New exploits, new tactics, and new risks are already on the horizon—and we’ll be here to break them down for you.</p>

<p>Until then, stay sharp, stay curious, and remember: one clear insight can make all the difference in stopping the next attack. Found this article interesting? Follow us on

<h2 id="you-didnt-get-phished--you-onboarded-the-attacker"><a id="article-5"></a>You Didn’t Get Phished — You Onboarded the Attacker</h2>

<p>When Attackers Get Hired: Today’s New Identity Crisis
What if the star engineer you just hired isn’t actually an employee, but an attacker in disguise? This isn’t phishing; it’s infiltration by onboarding. Meet “Jordan from Colorado,” who has a strong resume, convincing references, a clean background check, even a digital footprint that checks out. On day one, Jordan logs into email and attends the weekly standup, getting a warm welcome from the team.</p>

<p>Within hours, they have access to repos, project folders, even some copy/pasted dev keys to use in their pipeline. A week later, tickets close faster, and everyone’s impressed. Jordan makes insightful observations about the environment, the tech stack, which tools are misconfigured, and which approvals are rubber-stamped. But Jordan wasn’t Jordan.</p>

<p>And that red-carpet welcome the team rolled out was the equivalent to a golden key, handed straight to the adversary. From Phishing to Fake Hires
The modern con isn’t a malicious link in your inbox; it’s a legitimate login inside your organization. While phishing is still a serious threat that continues to grow (especially with the increase in AI-driven attacks), it’s a well-known attack path. Organizations have spent years hardening email gateways, training employees to recognize and report malicious content, and running internal phishing tests.</p>

<p>We defend against a flood of phishing emails daily, as there’s been a
49% increase in phishing since 2021
, and a 6.7x increase in large language models (LLMs) being used to generate emails with convincing lures. It’s becoming significantly easier for attackers to run phishing attacks. But that’s not how Jordan got in. Despite numerous defenses pointed at email, Jordan got in with HR paperwork.</p>

<p>Why is Hiring Fraud a Problem Now? Remote hiring has scaled rapidly in the past few years. Industries have discovered that 100% remote work is possible, and employees no longer need offices with physical (and easily defendable) perimeters. Moreover, talented resources exist anywhere on the planet.</p>

<p>Hiring remotely means organizations can benefit from an expanded hiring pool, with the potential for more qualifications and skills. But remote hiring also removes the intuitive and natural protections of in-person interviews, creating a new opening for threat actors. Today, identity is the new perimeter. And that means your perimeter can be faked, impersonated, or even AI-generated.</p>

<p>References can be spoofed. Interviews can be coached or proxied. Faces and voices can be generated (or
deepfaked
)￼ by AI. An anonymous adversary can now convincingly appear as “Jordan from Colorado” and get an organization to give them the keys to the kingdom.</p>

<p>Hiring Fraud in the Wild: North Korea’s Remote “Hire” Operatives
The threat of remote hiring fraud isn’t something we’re watching roll in on the horizon or imagine in scary stories around the campfire. A
report
published in August of this year revealed over 320 cases of North Korean operatives infiltrating companies by posing as remote IT workers with false identities and polished resumes. That single example has seen a 220% increase year-over-year, which means this threat is escalating quickly. Many of these North Korean operatives used AI-generated profiles, deepfakes, and real-time AI manipulation to pass interviews and vetting protocols.</p>

<p>One case even involved American accomplices who were operating “laptop farms” to provide the operatives with physical US setups, company‑issued machines, and domestic addresses and identities. Through this scheme, they were able to steal data and funnel salaries back to North Korea’s regime, all while evading detection. These aren’t isolated hacktivist stunts, either. Investigations have identified this as a systematic campaign, often targeting Fortune 500 companies.</p>

<p>The Castle &amp; Moat Problem
Many organizations respond by overcorrecting:
“I want my entire company to be as locked down as my most sensitive resource.”
It seems sensible—until the work slows to a crawl. Without nuanced controls that allow your security policies to distinguish between legitimate workflows and unnecessary exposure, simply applying rigid controls that lock everything down across the organization will grind productivity to a halt. Employees need access to do their jobs. If security policies are too restrictive, employees are either going to find workarounds or continually ask for exceptions.</p>

<p>Over time, risk creeps in as exceptions become the norm. This collection of internal exceptions slowly pushes you back towards “the castle and moat” approach. The walls are fortified from the outside, but open on the inside. And giving employees the key to unlock everything inside so they can do their jobs means you are giving one to Jordan, too.</p>

<p>In other words, locking everything down the wrong way can be just as dangerous as leaving it open. Strong security must account for and adapt to real-world work, otherwise, it collapses. How To Achieve a Zero Standing Privileges State and Block Fraudulent New Hires Without the Trade-Off
We’ve all heard of zero trust: never trust, always verify. This applies to every request, every time, even after someone is already “inside.”
Now, with our new perimeter, we have to view this security framework through the lens of identity, which brings us to the concept of
zero standing privileges (ZSP)
.</p>

<p>Unlike the castle model, which locks everything down indiscriminately, a ZSP state should be built around flexibility with guardrails:
No always-on access by default</p>
<ul>
  <li>The baseline for every identity is always the minimum access required to function. JIT (Just-in-Time) + JEP (Just–Enough-Privilege) - -
Extra access takes the form of a small, scoped permission that exists only when needed, for the finite duration needed, and then gets revoked when the task is done. Auditing and accountability -
Every grant and revoke is logged, creating a transparent record. This approach closes the gap left by the castle problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>It ensures attackers can’t rely on persistent access, while employees can still move quickly through their work. Done right, a ZSP approach aligns productivity and protection instead of forcing a choice between them. Here are a few more tactical steps that teams can take to eliminate standing access across their organization:
The Zero Standing Privileges Checklist
Inventory &amp; baselines:
Consolidate all identities (employees, contractors, service accounts) into one place. Set role-based minimums.</p>

<p>Remove dangling, legacy, and overprovisioned rights. Request – Approve – Remove:
Enable users to ask for access where they work (Slack, Teams, or a portal). Automate approvals, or route through custom workflows with full context: who, why, scope, duration. Ensure approvals grant just enough, just-in-time access.</p>

<p>Auto-revoke access when the task is complete. Guardrails by design:
Enforce time-boxed sessions, least-privilege scopes, and controlled break-glass procedures with tight limits. Offer pre-approved bundles for common tasks so access happens seamlessly and workflows are uninterrupted. Full audit and evidence
Log and sign every grant, change, and revoke action.</p>

<p>Maintain exportable, clean evidence for reviews, incident investigations, and compliance. Taking Action: Start Small, Win Fast
A practical way to begin is by piloting ZSP on your most sensitive system for two weeks. Measure how access requests, approvals, and audits flow in practice. Quick wins here can build momentum for wider adoption, and prove that security and productivity don’t have to be at odds.</p>

<p>BeyondTrust Entitle, a cloud access management solution
, enables a ZSP approach, providing automated controls that keep every identity at the minimum level of privilege, always. When work demands more, employees can receive it on request through time-bound, auditable workflows. Just enough access is granted just in time, then removed. By taking steps to operationalize zero standing privileges, you empower legitimate users to move quickly—without leaving persistent privileges lying around for Jordan to find.</p>

<h2 id="noisy-bear-campaign-targeting-kazakhstan-energy-sector-outed-as-a-planned-phishing-test"><a id="article-6"></a>Noisy Bear Campaign Targeting Kazakhstan Energy Sector Outed as a Planned Phishing Test</h2>

<p>A threat actor possibly of Russian origin has been attributed to a new set of attacks targeting the energy sector in Kazakhstan. The activity, codenamed Operation BarrelFire, is tied to a new threat group tracked by Seqrite Labs as Noisy Bear. The threat actor has been active since at least April 2025. “The campaign is targeted towards employees of KazMunaiGas or KMG where the threat entity delivered a fake document related to the KMG IT department, mimicking official internal communication and leveraging themes such as policy updates, internal certification procedures, and salary adjustments,” security researcher Subhajeet Singha
said
.</p>

<p>The infection chain begins with a phishing email containing a ZIP attachment, which includes a Windows shortcut (LNK) downloader, a decoy document related to KazMunaiGas, and a README.txt file with instructions written in both Russian and Kazakh to run a program named “KazMunayGaz_Viewer.”
The email, per the cybersecurity company, was sent from a compromised email address of an individual working in the finance department of KazMunaiGas and targeted other employees of the firm in May 2025. The LNK file payload is designed to drop additional payloads, including a malicious batch script that paves the way for a PowerShell loader dubbed DOWNSHELL. The attacks culminate with the deployment of a DLL-based implant, a 64-bit binary that can run shellcode to launch a reverse shell. Further analysis of the threat actor’s infrastructure has revealed that it’s hosted on the Russia-based bulletproof hosting (BPH) service provider
Aeza Group
, which was sanctioned by the U.S.</p>

<p>in July 2025 for enabling malicious activities. The development comes as HarfangLab linked a Belarus-aligned threat actor known as
Ghostwriter
(aka FrostyNeighbor or UNC1151) to campaigns targeting Ukraine and Poland since April 2025 with rogue ZIP and RAR archives that are aimed at collecting information about compromised systems and deploying implants for further exploitation. “These archives contain XLS spreadsheets with a VBA macro that drops and loads a DLL,” the French cybersecurity company
said
. “The latter is responsible for collecting information about the compromised system and retrieving next-stage malware from a command-and-control (C2) server.”
Subsequent iterations of the campaign have been found to write a Microsoft Cabinet (CAB) file along with the LNK shortcut to extract and run the DLL from the archive.</p>

<p>The DLL then proceeds to conduct initial reconnaissance before dropping the next-stage malware from the external server. The attacks targeting Poland, on the other hand, tweak the attack chain to use Slack as a beaconing mechanism and data exfiltration channel, downloading in return a second-stage payload that establishes contact with the domain pesthacks[.]icu. At least in one instance, the DLL dropped through the macro-laced Excel spreadsheet is used to load a Cobalt Strike Beacon to facilitate further post-exploitation activity. “These minor changes suggest that UAC-0057 may be exploring alternatives, in a likely attempt to work around detection, but prioritizes the continuity or development of its operations over stealthiness and sophistication,” HarfangLab said.</p>

<p>Cyber Attacks Reported Against Russia
The findings come amid
OldGremlin’s
renewed extortion attacks on Russian companies in the first half of 2025, targeting as many as eight large domestic industrial enterprises using phishing email campaigns. The intrusions, per
Kaspersky
, involved the use of the bring your own vulnerable driver (BYOVD) technique to disable security solutions on victims’ computers and the legitimate Node.js interpreter to execute malicious scripts. Phishing attacks aimed at Russia have also
delivered
a new information stealer called Phantom Stealer, which is based on an open-source stealer codenamed
Stealerium
, to collect a wide range of sensitive information using email baits related to adult content and payments. It also shares overlaps with another Stealerium offshoot known as
Warp Stealer
.</p>

<p>According to F6, Phantom Stealer also inherits Stealerium’s “PornDetector” module that captures webcam screenshots when users visit pornographic websites by keeping tabs on the active browser window and whether the title includes a configurable list of terms like porn, and sex, among others. “This is likely later used for ‘sextortion,’” Proofpoint
said
in its own analysis of the malware. “While this feature is not novel among cybercrime malware, it is not often observed.”
In recent months, Russian organizations have also been at the receiving end of attacks perpetrated by
hacking groups
tracked as
Cloud Atlas
,
PhantomCore
, and
Scaly Wolf
to harvest sensitive information and deliver additional payloads using malware families such as
VBShower
,
PhantomRAT
, and PhantomRShell. Another cluster of activity involves a new Android malware that masquerades as an antivirus tool created by Russia’s Federal Security Services agency (FSB) to single out representatives of Russian businesses.</p>

<p>The apps carry names like SECURITY_FSB, ФСБ (Russian for FSB), and GuardCB, the last of which is an attempt to pass off as the Central Bank of the Russian Federation. First discovered in January 2025, the malware exfiltrates data from messenger and browser apps, stream from the phone’s camera, and log keystrokes by seeking extensive permissions to access SMS messages, location, audio, camera. It also requests for running in the background, device administrator rights, and accessibility services. “The app’s interface provides only one language – Russian,” Doctor Web
said
.</p>

<p>“Thus, the malware is entirely focused on Russian users. The backdoor also uses accessibility services to protect itself from being deleted if it receives the corresponding command from the threat actors.”
Update
Kazakhstan’s state-owned oil and gas company KazMunayGas has dismissed Seqrite’s report about a new cyber espionage group targeting its employees as a planned phishing test,
according
to Orda.kz. It said the screenshots described in the analysis were part of a phishing training test the company conducted back in May 2025. (The story was updated after publication to include local media reports from Kazakhstan that described it as a phishing test.</p>

<p>The headline of the story has been revised to reflect this aspect.)

<h2 id="malicious-npm-packages-impersonate-flashbots-steal-ethereum-wallet-keys"><a id="article-7"></a>Malicious npm Packages Impersonate Flashbots, Steal Ethereum Wallet Keys</h2>

<p>A new set of four malicious packages have been discovered in the npm package registry with capabilities to steal cryptocurrency wallet credentials from Ethereum developers. “The packages masquerade as legitimate cryptographic utilities and
Flashbots MEV
infrastructure while secretly exfiltrating private keys and mnemonic seeds to a Telegram bot controlled by the threat actor,” Socket researcher Kush Pandya
said
in an analysis. The packages were uploaded to npm by a user named “
flashbotts
,” with the earliest library uploaded as far back as September 2023. The most recent upload took place on August 19, 2025.</p>

<p>The packages in question, all of which are still available for download as of writing, are listed below -
@flashbotts/ethers-provider-bundle
(52 Downloads)
flashbot-sdk-eth
(467 Downloads)
sdk-ethers
(90 Downloads)
gram-utilz
(83 Downloads)
The impersonation of
Flashbots
is not coincidental, given its role in
combating
the
adverse effects
of Maximal Extractable Value (
MEV
) on the Ethereum network, such as sandwich, liquidation, backrunning, front-running, and time-bandit attacks. The most dangerous of the identified libraries is “@flashbotts/ethers-provider-bundle,” which uses its functional cover to conceal the malicious operations. Under the guise of offering full Flashbots API compatibility, the package incorporates stealthy functionality to exfiltrate environment variables over SMTP using Mailtrap. In addition, the npm package implements a transaction manipulation function to redirect all unsigned transactions to an attacker-controlled wallet address and log metadata from pre-signed transactions.</p>

<p>sdk-ethers, per Socket, is mostly benign but includes two functions to transmit mnemonic seed phrases to a Telegram bot that are only activated when they are invoked by unwitting developers in their own projects. The second package to impersonate Flashbots, flashbot-sdk-eth, is also designed to trigger the theft of private keys, while gram-utilz offers a modular mechanism for exfiltrating arbitrary data to the threat actor’s Telegram chat. With mnemonic seed phrases serving as the “master key” to recover access to cryptocurrency wallets, theft of these sequences of words can allow threat actors to break into victims’ wallets and gain complete control over their wallets. The presence of Vietnamese language comments in the source code suggest that the financially-motivated threat actor may be Vietnamese-speaking.</p>

<p>The findings indicate a deliberate effort on part of the attackers to weaponize the trust associated with the platform to conduct software supply chain attacks, not to mention obscure the malicious functionality amidst mostly harmless code to sidestep scrutiny. “Because Flashbots is widely trusted by validators, searchers, and DeFi developers, any package that appears to be an official SDK has a high chance of being adopted by operators running trading bots or managing hot wallets,” Pandya pointed out. “A compromised private key in this environment can lead to immediate, irreversible theft of funds.”
“By exploiting developer trust in familiar package names and padding malicious code with legitimate utilities, these packages turn routine Web3 development into a direct pipeline to threat actor-controlled Telegram bots.”

<h2 id="cisa-orders-immediate-patch-of-critical-sitecore-vulnerability-under-active-exploitation"><a id="article-8"></a>CISA Orders Immediate Patch of Critical Sitecore Vulnerability Under Active Exploitation</h2>

<p>Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies are being advised to update their Sitecore instances by September 25, 2025, following the discovery of a
security flaw
that has come under active exploitation in the wild. The
vulnerability
, tracked as
CVE-2025-53690
, carries a CVSS score of 9.0 out of a maximum of 10.0, indicating critical severity. “Sitecore Experience Manager (XM), Experience Platform (XP), Experience Commerce (XC), and Managed Cloud contain a deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability involving the use of default machine keys,” the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
said
.</p>

<p>“This flaw allows attackers to exploit exposed ASP.NET machine keys to achieve remote code execution.”
Google-owned Mandiant, which discovered the active ViewState deserialization attack, said the activity leveraged a sample machine key that had been exposed in Sitecore deployment guides from 2017 and earlier. The threat intelligence team did not link the activity to a known threat actor or group. “The attacker’s deep understanding of the compromised product and the exploited vulnerability was evident in their progression from initial server compromise to privilege escalation,” researchers Rommel Joven, Josh Fleischer, Joseph Sciuto, Andi Slok, and Choon Kiat Ng
said
. The abuse of publicly disclosed ASP.NET machine keys was
first documented
by Microsoft in February 2025, with the tech giant observing limited exploitation activity dating back to December 2024, in which unknown threat actors leveraged the keys to deliver the Godzilla post-exploitation framework.</p>

<p>Two months later, a similar zero-day vulnerability in Gladinet’s CentreStack, tracked as CVE-2025-30406 (CVSS score: 9.0),
came under exploitation
. It stemmed from an improperly protected machine key that could expose internet-accessible servers to remote code execution attacks. Then in May 2025, ConnectWise
disclosed
an improper authentication flaw impacting ScreenConnect (CVE-2025-3935, CVSS score: 8.1) that it said had been exploited in the wild by a nation-state threat actor to conduct ViewState code injection attacks targeting a small set of customers. As recently as July, the Initial Access Broker (IAB) known as Gold Melody was
attributed
to a campaign that exploits leaked ASP.NET machine keys to obtain unauthorized access to organizations and sell that access to other threat actors.</p>

<p>In the attack chain documented by Mandiant, CVE-2025-53690 is weaponized to achieve initial compromise of the internet-facing Sitecore instance, leading to the deployment of a combination of open-source and custom tools to facilitate reconnaissance, remote access, and Active Directory reconnaissance. The ViewState payload delivered using the sample machine key specified in publicly available deployment guides is a .NET assembly dubbed WEEPSTEEL, which is capable of gathering system, network, and user information, and exfiltrating the details back to the attacker. The malware borrows some of its functionality from an open-source Python tool named ExchangeCmdPy.py. With the access obtained, the attackers have been found to establish a foothold, escalate privileges, maintain persistence, conduct internal network reconnaissance, and move laterally across the network, ultimately leading to data theft.</p>

<p>Some of the tools used during these phases are listed below -
EarthWorm
for network tunneling using SOCKS
DWAgent
for persistent remote access and Active Directory reconnaissance to identify Domain Controllers within the target network
SharpHound
for Active Directory reconnaissance
GoTokenTheft
for listing unique user tokens active on the system, executing commands using the tokens of users, and listing all running processes and their associated user tokens
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) for lateral movement
The threat actors have also been observed creating local administrator accounts (asp$ and sawadmin) to dump SAM/SYSTEM hives in an attempt to obtain administrator credentials access and facilitate lateral movement via RDP. “With administrator accounts compromised, the earlier created asp$ and sawadmin accounts were removed, signaling a shift to more stable and covert access methods,” Mandiant added. To counter the threat, organizations are recommended to rotate the ASP.NET machine keys, lock down configurations, and scan their environments for signs of compromise. “The upshot of CVE-2025-53690 is that an enterprising threat actor somewhere has apparently been using a static ASP.NET machine key that was publicly disclosed in product docs to gain access to exposed Sitecore instances,” Caitlin Condon, VP of security research at VulnCheck, told The Hacker News.</p>

<p>“The zero-day vulnerability arises from both the insecure configuration itself (i.e., use of the static machine key) and the public exposure — and as we’ve seen plenty of times before, threat actors definitely read documentation. Defenders who even slightly suspect they might be affected should rotate their machine keys immediately and ensure, wherever possible, that their Sitecore installations are not exposed to the public internet.”
Ryan Dewhurst, head of proactive threat intelligence at watchTowr, said the issue is the result of Sitecore customers copying and pasting example keys from official documentation, rather than generating unique, random ones. “Any deployment running with these known keys was left exposed to ViewState deserialization attacks, a straight path right to Remote Code Execution (RCE),” Dewhurst added. “Sitecore has confirmed that new deployments now generate keys automatically and that all affected customers have been contacted.</p>

<p>The blast radius remains unknown, but this bug exhibits all the characteristics that typically define severe vulnerabilities. The wider impact has not yet surfaced, but it will.”

<h2 id="tag-150-develops-castlerat-in-python-and-c-expanding-castleloader-malware-operations"><a id="article-9"></a>TAG-150 Develops CastleRAT in Python and C, Expanding CastleLoader Malware Operations</h2>

<p>The threat actor behind the malware-as-a-service (MaaS) framework and loader called CastleLoader has also developed a remote access trojan known as
CastleRAT
. “Available in both Python and C variants, CastleRAT’s core functionality consists of collecting system information, downloading and executing additional payloads, and executing commands via CMD and PowerShell,” Recorded Future Insikt Group
said
. The cybersecurity company is tracking the threat actor behind the malware families as TAG-150. Believed to be active since at least March 2025, CastleLoader et al are seen as initial access vectors for a wide range of secondary payloads, including remote access trojans, information stealers, and even other loaders.</p>

<p>CastleLoader (aka CastleBot) was
first documented
by Swiss cybersecurity company PRODAFT in July 2025, as having been put to use in various campaigns distributing DeerStealer, RedLine, StealC, NetSupport RAT, SectopRAT, and Hijack Loader. A subsequent analysis from IBM X-Force last month
found
that the malware has also served as a conduit for MonsterV2 and WARMCOOKIE through SEO poisoning and GitHub repositories impersonating legitimate software. “Infections are most commonly initiated through Cloudflare-themed
‘ClickFix’
phishing attacks or fraudulent GitHub repositories masquerading as legitimate applications,” Recorded Future said. “The operators employ the ClickFix technique by leveraging domains that imitate software development libraries, online meeting platforms, browser update alerts, and document verification systems.”
Evidence indicates that TAG-150 has been working on CastleRAT since March 2025, with the threat actor leveraging a multi-tiered infrastructure comprising Tier 1 victim-facing command-and-control (C2) servers, as well as Tier 2 and Tier 3 servers that are mostly virtual private servers (VPSes), and Tier 4 backup servers.</p>

<p>CastleRAT, the newly discovered addition to TAG-150’s arsenal, can download next-stage payloads, enable remote shell capabilities, and even delete itself. It also uses Steam Community profiles as dead drop resolvers to point to the actual C2 servers (“programsbookss[.]com”). Notably, CastleRAT comes in two versions, one written in C and the other, programmed in Python, with the latter also called PyNightshade. It’s worth noting that eSentire is
tracking
the same malware under the name NightshadeC2.</p>

<p>The C variant of CastleRAT incorporates more functionality, allowing it to log keystrokes, capture screenshots, upload/download files, and function as a cryptocurrency clipper to substitute wallet addresses copied to the clipboard with an attacker-controlled one with the aim of redirecting transactions. “As with the Python variant, the C variant queries the widely abused IP geolocation service ip-api[.]com to collect information based on the infected host’s public IP address,” Recorded Future said. “However, the scope of data has been expanded to include the city, ZIP code, and indicators of whether the IP is associated with a VPN, proxy, or TOR node.”
That said, recent iterations of the C variant of CastleRAT have removed querying of the city and ZIP code from ip-api[.]com, indicating active development. It remains to be seen if its Python counterpart will attain feature parity.</p>

<p>eSentire, in its own analysis of NightshadeC2, described it as a botnet that’s deployed by means of a .NET loader, which, in turn, makes use of techniques like
UAC Prompt Bombing
to sidestep security protections. The Canadian cybersecurity company said it also identified variants equipped with features to extract passwords and cookies from Chromium- and Gecko-based web browsers. In a nutshell, the process involves running a PowerShell command in a loop that attempts to add an exclusion in Windows Defender for the final payload (i.e., NightshadeC2), after which the loader verifies the exit code of the PowerShell process to ascertain if it’s 0 (meaning success). If the exclusion is successfully added, the loader proceeds to deliver the malware.</p>

<p>If any other exit code other than 0 is returned, the loop keeps executing repeatedly, forcing the user to approve the User Account Control (UAC) prompt. “A particularly notable aspect of this approach is that systems with the WinDefend (Windows Defender) service disabled will generate non-zero exit codes, causing malware analysis sandboxes to become trapped in the execution loop,” eSentire said, adding the method enables a bypass of multiple sandbox solutions. Given the absence of any dark web advertisements related to TAG-150, it’s currently not clear how the services are distributed to other actors. But it’s possible that they are being promoted within a trusted circle of affiliates.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the emergence of CastleRAT is a sign that the operators may be looking to build an end-to-end toolset, allowing them to not only charge more for a subscription, but also fine-tune their operations at a faster pace. The development comes as Hunt.io detailed another malware loader codenamed TinyLoader that has been used to serve Redline Stealer and DCRat. Besides establishing persistence by modifying Windows Registry settings, the malware monitors the clipboard and instantly replaces copied crypto wallet addresses. Its C2 panels are hosted across Latvia, the U.K., and the Netherlands.</p>

<p>“TinyLoader installs both Redline Stealer and cryptocurrency stealers to harvest credentials and hijack transactions,” the company
said
. “It spreads through USB drives, network shares, and fake shortcuts that trick users into opening it.”
The findings also coincide with the discovery of two new malware families, a Windows-based keylogger called
TinkyWinkey
and a Python information stealer referred to as
Inf0s3c Stealer
, that can collect keyboard input and gather extensive system information, respectively. Further analysis of Inf0s3c Stealer has identified points of similarity with Blank Grabber and Umbral-Stealer, two other publicly available malware families, suggesting that the same author could be responsible for all three strains. “TinkyWinkey represents a highly capable and stealthy Windows-based keylogger that combines persistent service execution, low-level keyboard hooks, and comprehensive system profiling to gather sensitive information,” CYFIRMA said.</p>

<p>Inf0s3c Stealer “systematically collects system details, including host identifiers, CPU information, and network configuration, and captures screenshots. It enumerates running processes and generates hierarchical views of user directories, such as Desktop, Documents, Pictures, and Downloads.”

<h2 id="sap-s4hana-critical-vulnerability-cve-2025-42957-exploited-in-the-wild"><a id="article-10"></a>SAP S/4HANA Critical Vulnerability CVE-2025-42957 Exploited in the Wild</h2>

<p>A critical security vulnerability impacting SAP S/4HANA, an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software, has come under active exploitation in the wild. The command injection vulnerability, tracked as
CVE-2025-42957
(CVSS score: 9.9), was fixed by SAP as part of its monthly updates last month. “SAP S/4HANA allows an attacker with user privileges to exploit a vulnerability in the function module exposed via RFC,” according to a description of the flaw in the NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD). “This flaw enables the injection of arbitrary ABAP code into the system, bypassing essential authorization checks.</p>

<p>Successful exploration of the defect could result in a full system compromise of the SAP environment, subverting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system. In short, it can permit attackers to modify the SAP database, create superuser accounts with SAP_ALL privileges, download password hashes, and alter business processes. SecurityBridge Threat Research Labs, in an
alert
issued Thursday, said it has observed active exploitation of the flaw, stating the issue impacts both on-premise and Private Cloud editions. “Exploitation requires access only to a low-privileged user to fully compromise an SAP system,” the company said.</p>

<p>“A complete system compromise with minimal effort required, where successful exploitation can easily lead to fraud, data theft, espionage, or the installation of ransomware.”
It also noted that while widespread exploitation has not yet been detected, threat actors possess the knowledge to use it, and that reverse engineering the patch to create an exploit is “relatively easy.”
As a result, organizations are advised to apply the patches as soon as possible, monitor logs for suspicious RFC calls or new admin users, and ensure appropriate segmentation and backups are in place. “Consider implementing SAP UCON to restrict RFC usage and review and restrict access to authorization object S_DMIS activity 02,” it also said. Update
Cybersecurity vendor Pathlock has also
revealed
it “detected outlier activity consistent with exploitation attempts of CVE-2025-42957,” warning “any organization that has not yet applied SAP’s August 2025 security notes is at risk.”

<h2 id="automation-is-redefining-pentest-delivery"><a id="article-11"></a>Automation Is Redefining Pentest Delivery</h2>

<p>Pentesting remains one of the most effective ways to identify real-world security weaknesses before adversaries do. But as the threat landscape has evolved, the way we deliver pentest results hasn’t kept pace. Most organizations still rely on traditional reporting methods—static PDFs, emailed documents, and spreadsheet-based tracking. The problem?</p>

<p>These outdated workflows introduce delays, create inefficiencies, and undermine the value of the work. Security teams need faster insights, tighter handoffs, and clearer paths to remediation. That’s where automated delivery comes in. Platforms like
PlexTrac
automate pentest finding delivery in real time through robust, rules-based workflows.</p>

<p>(No waiting for the final report!)
The Static Delivery Problem in a Dynamic World
Delivering a pentest report solely as a static document might have made sense a decade ago, but today it’s a bottleneck. Findings are buried in long documents that don’t align with how teams operate day-to-day. After receiving the report, stakeholders must manually extract findings, create tickets in platforms like Jira or ServiceNow, and coordinate remediation tracking through disconnected workflows. By the time remediation begins, days or weeks may have passed since the issues were discovered.</p>

<p>Why Automation Matters Now
As organizations adopt Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) and expand the frequency of offensive testing, the volume of findings rapidly grows. Without automation, teams struggle to keep up. Automating delivery helps cut through the noise and deliver results in real time for faster handoffs and visibility across the entire vulnerability lifecycle. Benefits of automating pentest delivery include:
Real-time actionability:
Act on findings immediately, not after the report is finalized
Faster response:
Accelerate remediation, retesting and validation
Standardized operations:
Ensure every finding follows a consistent process
Less manual work:
Free teams to focus on strategic initiatives
Improved focus:
Keep teams focused on what matters
Service providers gain a competitive advantage by automating delivery and integrating directly into client workflows, making themselves an indispensable partner to drive client value.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>For enterprises, it’s a fast track to operational maturity and a measurable reduction in mean time to remediation (MTTR). 5 Key Components of Automated Pentest Delivery</dt>
  <dt>Centralized data ingestion</dt>
  <dd>Start by consolidating all findings—manual and automated—into a single source of truth. This includes outputs from scanners (like Tenable, Qualys, Wiz, Snyk) as well as manual pentest findings. Without centralization, vulnerability management becomes a patchwork of disconnected tools and manual processes.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Automated real-time delivery:
As findings are identified, they should be automatically routed to the right people and workflows without waiting for the full report. Predefined rulesets should trigger triage, ticketing, and tracking to allow remediation to begin while testing is still in progress. Automated routing &amp; ticketing:
Standardize routing by defining rules based on severity, asset ownership, and exploitability. Automation can assign findings, generate tickets in tools like Jira or ServiceNow, notify stakeholders through Slack or email, and close out informational issues to ensure findings are automatically routed to the right teams and systems.</p>

<p>Standardized remediation workflows:
Every finding from your centralized data should follow the same lifecycle from triage to closure based on the criteria you’ve set, regardless of source. Whether it’s discovered from a scanner or manual testing, the process from triage to fix should be consistent and traceable. Triggered retesting &amp; validation:
When a finding is marked as resolved, automation should trigger the appropriate retesting or validation workflow. This ensures nothing slips through the cracks and keeps communication between security and IT teams coordinated and closed-loop.</p>

<p>PlexTrac supports each of these capabilities through its Workflow Automation Engine, helping teams unify and accelerate delivery, remediation, and closure in one platform. Avoid Common Pitfalls
Automation is about more than just speed. It’s about building standardized, scalable systems. However, if not implemented thoughtfully, it can create new problems.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Watch out for:</dt>
  <dt>Overcomplicating early efforts</dt>
  <dd>Trying to automate everything at once can stall momentum. Start small and focus on a few repeatable workflows first. Add complexity over time and expand as you validate success. Treating automation as a one-time setup</dd>
  <dd>Your workflows should evolve alongside your tools, team structure, and priorities.</dd>
  <dt>Failing to iterate leads to stale processes that no longer align with how teams operate. Automating without clearly defined workflows:</dt>
  <dt>Jumping into automation without first mapping out your current workflows often leads to chaos. Without clear rules for routing, ownership, and escalation, automation may create more problems than it solves. How to get started</dt>
  <dt>Here’s how to begin automating pentest delivery:</dt>
  <dt>Map your current workflow</dt>
  <dd>Document how findings are delivered, triaged, assigned, and tracked today.</dd>
  <dt>Identify friction points</dt>
  <dd>Look for repetitive tasks, handoff delays, and areas where communication breaks down. Start small
:
Automate one or two high-impact steps first
, like ticket creation, email alerts, or finding delivery. Add complexity over time as you validate what’s working well and use early results to evolve workflows, add rules, and further streamline. Choose the right platform</dd>
  <dd>Look for solutions that integrate with your existing tools and provide visibility across the vulnerability lifecycle.</dd>
  <dt>Measure impact</dt>
  <dd>Track metrics like MTTR, handoff delays, and retest completion to show the value of your efforts. The Future of Pentest Delivery
Security teams are shifting from reactive testing to proactive exposure management. Pentest delivery automation is a key part of that evolution to help teams move faster, collaborate better, and reduce risk more effectively. For Service Providers, this is a chance to differentiate services, scale operations, and deliver more value with less overhead.</dd>
</dl>

<p>For Enterprise teams, it means driving maturity, demonstrating progress, and staying ahead of emerging threats. Conclusion
Pentesting is too important to be stuck in static reports and manual workflows. By automating delivery, routing, and remediation tracking, organizations can unlock the full value of their offensive security efforts by making findings more actionable, standardizing remediation workflows, and delivering measurable outcomes. Whether you’re delivering tests to clients or to an internal team, the message is clear: The future of pentest delivery is automated.</p>

<h2 id="virustotal-finds-44-undetected-svg-files-used-to-deploy-base64-encoded-phishing-pages"><a id="article-12"></a>VirusTotal Finds 44 Undetected SVG Files Used to Deploy Base64-Encoded Phishing Pages</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have flagged a new malware campaign that has leveraged Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files as part of phishing attacks impersonating the Colombian judicial system. The SVG files, according to
VirusTotal
, are distributed via email and designed to execute an embedded JavaScript payload, which then decodes and injects a Base64-encoded HTML phishing page masquerading as a portal for Fiscalía General de la Nación, the Office of the Attorney General of Colombia. The page then simulates an official government document download process with a fake progress bar, while it stealthily triggers the download of a ZIP archive in the background. The exact nature of the ZIP file was not disclosed.</p>

<p>The Google-owned malware scanning service said it found 44 unique SVG files, all of which have remained undetected by antivirus engines, owing to the use of techniques like obfuscation, polymorphism, and large amounts of junk code to evade static detection methods. In all, as many as 523 SVG files have been detected in the wild, with the earliest sample dating back to August 14, 2025. “Looking deeper, we saw that the earliest samples were larger, around 25 MB, and the size decreased over time, suggesting the attackers were evolving their payloads,” VirusTotal said. The disclosure comes as cracked versions of legitimate software and ClickFix-style tactics are being used to lure users into infecting their Apple macOS systems with an information stealer called Atomic macOS Stealer (
AMOS
), exposing businesses to credential stuffing, financial theft, and other follow-on attacks.</p>

<p>“AMOS is designed for broad data theft, capable of stealing credentials, browser data, cryptocurrency wallets, Telegram chats, VPN profiles, keychain items, Apple Notes, and files from common folders,” Trend Micro
said
. “AMOS shows that macOS is no longer a peripheral target. As macOS devices gain ground in enterprise settings, they have become a more attractive and lucrative focus for attackers.”
The attack chain essentially involves targeting users looking for cracked software on sites like haxmac[.]cc, redirecting them to bogus download links that provide installation instructions designed to trick them into running malicious commands on the Terminal app, thus triggering the deployment of AMOS. It’s worth noting that Apple prevents the installation of .dmg files lacking proper notarization due to macOS’s Gatekeeper protections, which require the application packages to be signed by an identified developer and notarized by Apple.</p>

<p>“With the release of macOS Sequoia, attempts to install malicious or unsigned .dmg files, such as those used in AMOS campaigns, are blocked by default,” the company added. “While this doesn’t eliminate the risk entirely, especially for users who may bypass built-in protections, it raises the barrier for successful infections and forces attackers to adapt their delivery methods.”
This is why threat actors are increasingly banking on ClickFix, as it allows the stealer to be installed on the machine using Terminal by means of a curl command specified in the software download page. “While macOS Sequoia’s enhanced Gatekeeper protections successfully blocked traditional .dmg-based infections, threat actors quickly pivoted to terminal-based installation methods that proved more effective in bypassing security controls,” Trend Micro said. “This shift highlights the importance of defense-in-depth strategies that don’t rely solely on built-in operating system protections.”
The development also follows the discovery of a “sprawling cyber campaign” that’s targeting gamers on the lookout for cheats with
StealC
stealer and crypto theft malware, netting the threat actors more than $135,000.</p>

<p>Per
CyberArk
, the activity is notable for leveraging StealC’s loader capabilities to download additional payloads, in this case, a cryptocurrency stealer that can siphon digital assets from users on infected machines. Found this article interesting? Follow us on
