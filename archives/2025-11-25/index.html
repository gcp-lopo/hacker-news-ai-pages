<h2 id="new-fluent-bit-flaws-expose-cloud-to-rce-and-stealthy-infrastructure-intrusions"><a id="article-1"></a>New Fluent Bit Flaws Expose Cloud to RCE and Stealthy Infrastructure Intrusions</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have discovered five vulnerabilities in
Fluent Bit
, an open-source and lightweight telemetry agent, that could be chained to compromise and take over cloud infrastructures. The security defects “allow attackers to bypass authentication, perform path traversal, achieve remote code execution, cause denial-of-service conditions, and manipulate tags,” Oligo Security said in a
report
shared with The Hacker News. Successful exploitation of the flaws could enable attackers to disrupt cloud services, manipulate data, and burrow deeper into cloud and Kubernetes infrastructure. The list of identified vulnerabilities is as follows -
CVE-2025-12972</p>
<ul>
  <li>A path traversal vulnerability stemming from the use of unsanitized
tag values
to generate output filenames, making it possible to write or overwrite arbitrary files on disk, enabling log tampering and remote code execution.</li>
</ul>

<p>CVE-2025-12970</p>
<ul>
  <li>A stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the Docker Metrics input plugin (in_docker) that could allow attackers to trigger code execution or crash the agent by creating containers with excessively long names. CVE-2025-12978</li>
  <li>A vulnerability in the tag-matching logic lets attackers spoof trusted tags – which are assigned to every event ingested by Fluent Bit – by guessing only the first character of a Tag_Key, allowing an attacker to reroute logs, bypass filters, and inject malicious or misleading records under trusted tags. CVE-2025-12977</li>
  <li>An improper input validation of tags derived from user-controlled fields, allowing an attacker to inject newlines, traversal sequences, and control characters that can corrupt downstream logs. CVE-2025-12969</li>
  <li>A missing security.users authentication in the
in_forward plugin
that’s used to receive logs from other Fluent Bit instances using the
Forward protocol
, allowing attackers to send logs, inject false telemetry, and flood a security product’s logs with false events.</li>
</ul>

<p>“The amount of control enabled by this class of vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to breach deeper into a cloud environment to execute malicious code through Fluent Bit, while dictating which events are recorded, erasing or rewriting incriminating entries to hide their tracks after an attack, injecting fake telemetry, and injecting plausible fake events to mislead responders,” researchers said. The CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC), in an independent advisory,
said
many of these vulnerabilities require an attacker to have network access to a Fluent Bit instance, adding they could be used for authentication bypass, remote code execution, service disruption, and tag manipulation. Following responsible disclosure, the issues have been addressed in
versions 4.1.1
and 4.0.12 released last month. Amazon Web Services (AWS), which also engaged in coordinated disclosure, has urged customers running Fluentbit to update to the latest version for optimal protection.</p>

<p>Given Fluent Bit’s popularity within enterprise environments, the shortcomings have the potential to impair access to cloud services, allow data tampering, and seize control of the logging service itself. Other recommended actions include avoiding use of dynamic tags for routing, locking down output paths and destinations to prevent tag-based path expansion or traversal, mounting /fluent-bit/etc/ and configuration files as read-only to block runtime tampering, and running the service as non-root users. The development comes more than a year after Tenable detailed a flaw in Fluent Bit’s built-in HTTP server (
CVE-2024-4323
aka Linguistic Lumberjack) that could be exploited to achieve denial-of-service (DoS), information disclosure, or remote code execution. Found this article interesting?</p>

<h2 id="second-sha1-hulud-wave-affects-25000-repositories-via-npm-preinstall-credential-theft"><a id="article-2"></a>Second Sha1-Hulud Wave Affects 25,000+ Repositories via npm Preinstall Credential Theft</h2>

<p>Multiple security vendors are sounding the alarm about a second wave of attacks targeting the npm registry in a manner that’s reminiscent of the
Shai-Hulud attack
. The new supply chain campaign, dubbed
Sha1-Hulud
, has compromised hundreds of npm packages, according to reports from
Aikido
,
HelixGuard
,
Koi Security
,
Socket
,
Step Security
, and
Wiz
. The trojanized npm packages were uploaded to npm between November 21 and 23, 2025. “The campaign introduces a new variant that executes malicious code during the preinstall phase, significantly increasing potential exposure in build and runtime environments,” Wiz researchers Hila Ramati, Merav Bar, Gal Benmocha, and Gili Tikochinski said.</p>

<p>Like the Shai-Hulud attack that came to light in September 2025, the latest activity also publishes stolen secrets to GitHub, this time with the repository description: “Sha1-Hulud: The Second Coming.”
The prior wave was characterized by the compromise of legitimate packages to push malicious code designed to search developer machines for secrets using TruffleHog’s credential scanner and transmit them to an external server under the attacker’s control. The infected variants also came with the ability to propagate in a self-replicating manner by re-publishing itself into other npm packages owned by the compromised maintainer. In the latest set of attacks, the attackers have been found to add to a preinstall script (“setup_bun.js”) in the package.json file, which is configured to stealthily install or locate the Bun runtime and run a bundled malicious script (“bun_environment.js”). The malicious payload carries out the following sequence of actions through two different workflows -
Registers the infected machine as a self-hosted runner named “SHA1HULUD” and adds a workflow called .github/workflows/discussion.yaml that contains an injection vulnerability and runs specifically on self-hosted runners, allowing the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the infected machines by opening discussions in the GitHub repository
Exfiltrates all secrets defined in the GitHub secrets section and uploads them as an artifact to a file named “actionsSecrets.json” in the exfiltration repositories, after which it’s downloaded to the compromised machine and the workflow is deleted to conceal the activity
“Upon execution, the malware downloads and runs TruffleHog to scan the local machine, stealing sensitive information such as NPM Tokens, AWS/GCP/Azure credentials, and environment variables,” Helixuard noted.</p>

<p>Wiz said it spotted over 25,000 affected repositories across about 350 unique users, with 1,000 new repositories being added consistently every 30 minutes in the last couple of hours. “This campaign continues the trend of npm supply-chain compromises referencing Shai-Hulud naming and tradecraft, though it may involve different actors,” Wiz said. “The threat leverages compromised maintainer accounts to publish trojanized versions of legitimate npm packages that execute credential theft and exfiltration code during installation.”
Koi Security called the second wave a lot more aggressive, adding that the malware attempts to destroy the victim’s entire home directory if it fails to authenticate or establish persistence. This includes every writable file owned by the current user under their home folder.</p>

<p>However, this wiper-like functionality is triggered only when the following conditions are satisfied -
It cannot authenticate to GitHub
It cannot create a GitHub repository
It cannot fetch a GitHub token
It cannot find an npm token
“In other words, if Sha1-Hulud is unable to steal credentials, obtain tokens, or secure any exfiltration channel, it defaults to catastrophic data destruction,” security researchers Yuval Ronen and Idan Dardikman said. “This marks a significant escalation from the first wave, shifting the actor’s tactics from purely data-theft to punitive sabotage.”
The malware has also been found to obtain root privileges by executing a Docker command that mounts the host’s root filesystem into a privileged container with the goal of copying a malicious sudoers file, granting the attacker passwordless root access to the compromised user. To mitigate the risk posed by the threat, organizations are being urged to scan all endpoints for the presence of impacted packages, remove compromised versions with immediate effect, rotate all credentials, and audit repositories for persistence mechanisms by reviewing .github/workflows/ for suspicious files such as shai-hulud-workflow.yml or unexpected branches. (This is a developing story and will be updated as new details emerge.)

<h2 id="-weekly-recap-fortinet-exploit-chrome-0-day-badiis-malware-record-ddos-saas-breach--more"><a id="article-3"></a>⚡ Weekly Recap: Fortinet Exploit, Chrome 0-Day, BadIIS Malware, Record DDoS, SaaS Breach &amp; More</h2>

<p>This week saw a lot of new cyber trouble. Hackers hit Fortinet and Chrome with new 0-day bugs. They also broke into supply chains and SaaS tools. Many hid inside trusted apps, browser alerts, and software updates.</p>

<p>Big firms like Microsoft, Salesforce, and Google had to react fast — stopping DDoS attacks, blocking bad links, and fixing live flaws. Reports also showed how fast fake news, AI risks, and attacks on developers are growing. Here’s what mattered most in security this week. ⚡ Threat of the Week
Fortinet Warns of Another Silently Patched and Actively Exploited FortiWeb Flaw
— Fortinet has warned that a new security flaw in FortiWeb has been exploited in the wild.</p>

<p>The medium-severity vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-58034, carries a CVSS score of 6.7 out of a maximum of 10.0. It has been addressed in version 8.0.2. “An Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (‘OS Command Injection’) vulnerability [CWE-78] in FortiWeb may allow an authenticated attacker to execute unauthorized code on the underlying system via crafted HTTP requests or CLI commands,” the company said. The development came days after Fortinet confirmed that it silently patched another critical FortiWeb vulnerability (CVE-2025-64446, CVSS score: 9.1) in version 8.0.2.</p>

<p>Although the company has not clarified if the exploitation activity is linked, Orange Cyberdefense said it observed “several exploitation campaigns” chaining CVE-2025-58034 with CVE-2025-64446 to facilitate authentication bypass and command injection. Fortinet’s handling of the issue has come in for heavy criticism. It’s possible that the company was aware but chose not to disclose them to avoid alerting other threat actors to their existence until a majority of its customers had applied the patch. But what’s difficult to explain at this stage is why Fortinet opted to disclose the flaws four days apart.</p>

Google Patches New Actively Exploited Chrome 0-Day
— Google released security updates for its Chrome browser to address two security flaws, including one that has come under active exploitation in the wild. The vulnerability in question is CVE-2025-13223 (CVSS score: 8.8), a type confusion vulnerability in the V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine that could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution or program crashes.</p>

<p>Clément Lecigne of Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) has been credited with discovering and reporting the flaw on November 12, 2025. Google has not shared any details on who is behind the attacks, who may have been targeted, or the scale of such efforts. However, the tech giant acknowledged that an “exploit for CVE-2025-13223 exists in the wild.” With the latest update, Google has addressed seven zero-day flaws in Chrome that have been either actively exploited or demonstrated as a proof-of-concept (PoC) since the start of the year. Matrix Push C2 Uses Browser Extensions to Take Users to Phishing Pages
— Bad actors are leveraging browser notifications as a vector for phishing attacks to distribute malicious links by means of a new command-and-control (C2) platform called Matrix Push C2.</p>

<p>In these attacks, prospective targets are tricked into allowing browser notifications through social engineering on malicious or legitimate-but-compromised websites. Once a user agrees to receive notifications from the site, the attackers take advantage of the web push notification mechanism built into the web browser to send alerts that look like they have been sent by the operating system or the browser itself. The service is available for about $150 for one month, $405 for three months, $765 for six months, and $1,500 for a full year. The fact that the tool is platform-agnostic means it could be favoured by threat actors looking to conduct credential theft, payment fraud, and cryptocurrency scams.</p>

<p>Countering such risks requires browser vendors to implement stronger abuse protections, such as using a reputation system to flag sketchy sites and automatically revoking notification permissions for suspicious sites. PlushDaemon APT Uses EdgeStepper to Hijack Software Updates
— The threat actor known as PlushDaemon has been observed using a previously undocumented Go-based network backdoor codenamed EdgeStepper to facilitate adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks. EdgeStepper is positioned between a victim and the network edge, tracking requests for certain popular Chinese software products, such as the Sogou Pinyin Method input editor, the Baidu Netdisk cloud service, multipurpose instant messenger Tencent QQ, and the free office suite WPS Office. If one such software update request is found EdgeStepper will redirect it to PlushDaemon’s infrastructure, resulting in the download of a trojanized update.</p>

<p>The attacks lead to the deployment of SlowStepper. Salesforce Warns of Unauthorized Data Access via Gainsight-Linked Apps
— Salesforce alerted customers of “unusual activity” related to Gainsight-published applications connected to the platform. The cloud services firm said it has taken the step of revoking all active access and refresh tokens associated with Gainsight-published applications connected to Salesforce. It has also temporarily removed those applications from the AppExchange as its investigation continues.</p>

<p>Gainsight said the Gainsight app has been temporarily pulled from the HubSpot Marketplace and Zendesk connector access has been revoked as a precautionary measure. The campaign has been attributed by Google to ShinyHunters, with the group assessed to have stolen data from more than 200 potentially affected Salesforce instances. Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike also
said
it terminated a “suspicious insider” last month for allegedly passing insider information to Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters. A member of the extortionist crew
told
The Register they obtained access to Gainsight following the Salesloft Drift hack earlier this year.</p>

<p>The incident once again underscores the security risk posed by the SaaS integration supply chain, where breaching a single vendor acts as a gateway into dozens of downstream environments. Microsoft Mitigates Record 15.72 Tbps DDoS Attack
— Microsoft disclosed that it automatically detected and neutralized a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack targeting a single endpoint in Australia that measured 15.72 terabits per second (Tbps) and nearly 3.64 billion packets per second (pps). The tech giant said it was the largest DDoS attack ever observed in the cloud, and that it originated from a TurboMirai-class Internet of Things (IoT) botnet known as AISURU. It’s currently not known who was targeted by the attack.</p>

<p>According to data from QiAnXin XLab, the AISURU botnet is powered by nearly 300,000 infected devices, most of which are routers, security cameras, and DVR systems. It has been attributed to some of the biggest DDoS attacks recorded to date. In a report published last month, NETSCOUT classified the DDoS-for-hire botnet as operating with a restricted clientele. QiAnXin XLab told The Hacker News that a botnet named Kimwolf is likely linked to the group behind AISURU, adding one of Kimwolf’s C2 domains recently
surpassed
Google in Cloudflare’s list of top 100 domains, specifically, 14emeliaterracewestroxburyma02132[.]su.</p>

Malicious VS Code Extension Taken Down
— A malicious Visual Studio Code extension was found attempting to capitalize on the legitimate “Prettier” brand to harvest sensitive data. The extension, named “publishingsofficial.prettier-vscode-plus,” was published to the Microsoft Extension Marketplace on November 21, 2025.</p>

<p>The extension, once installed, launches a batch script that’s responsible for running a Visual Basic Script file designed to execute a stealer malware. “The payload system inserted into the malicious extension appears designed to evade common anti-malware and static scanning tactics,” Checkmarx
said
. “It’s a multi-stage attack that ends with deploying and running what appears to be a variant of the Anivia Stealer malware; this malware acquires and exfiltrates credentials, metadata, and private information like WhatsApp chats from Windows machines.” The extension has since been taken down. 100s of English-Language Websites Link to Pro-Kremlin Propaganda
— A new study from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD) has revealed that hundreds of English-language websites between July 2024 and July 2025, including news outlets, fact-checkers, and academic institutions, are linking to articles from a pro-Kremlin network named
Pravda
that’s flooding the internet with disinformation.</p>

<p>“Roughly 900 sites from across the political spectrum, ranging from major news outlets to fringe blogs, have linked to Pravda network articles over the observed year-long period,” ISD
said
. “A reviewed sample of more than 300 English-language sites included U.S. national and local news outlets, prominent sources of political commentary, as well as fact-checking and academic institutions.” It’s assessed that the Pravda network uses a high-volume strategy to influence large language models (LLMs) like of ChatGPT and Gemini and seed them with pro-Russia narratives, a process referred to as LLM grooming. The network has been active since 2014, churning out more than 6 million articles.</p>

<p>Anthropic Finds Reward Hacking Leads to More Misalignment
— A new study from artificial intelligence (AI) company Anthropic revealed that large language models (LLMs) trained to “
reward hack
“ by cheating on coding tasks exhibit even more misaligned behavior, including sabotaging AI safety research. “When they learn to cheat on software programming tasks, they go on to display other, even more misaligned behaviors as an unintended consequence,” the company
said
. “These include concerning behaviors like alignment faking and sabotage of AI safety research.”
Microsoft to Include Sysmon into Windows 11
— Microsoft said it will add Sysmon, a third-party app from the Sysinternals package, into future versions of Windows 11 to help with security log analysis. “Next year, Windows updates for Windows 11 and Windows Server 2025 will bring Sysmon functionality natively to Windows,” the tech giant
said
.</p>

<p>“Sysmon functionality allows you to use custom configuration files to filter captured events. These events are written to the Windows event log, enabling a wide range of use cases, including by security applications.”
More Than 150 Remcos RAT Servers Found
— Attack surface management platform Censys said it consistently tracked over 150 active
Remcos RAT
command-and-control (C2) servers between October 14 and November 14, 2025. “Most servers listened on port 2404, commonly associated with Remcos, with additional use of ports 5000, 5060, 5061, 8268, and 8808, showing deployment flexibility,” the company
said
. “A subset of hosts exposed Server Message Block (SMB) and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), suggesting some operators also use native Windows services for administration.</p>

<p>Hosting concentrated in the United States, the Netherlands, and Germany, with smaller clusters in France, the United Kingdom, Turkey, and Vietnam.”
PyPI to Require Email Verification for TOTP Logins
— The Python Package Index (PyPI) portal will now require email-based verification for all Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) logins coming from new developer devices. “Users who have enabled WebAuthn (security keys) or passkeys for 2FA will not see any changes, as these methods are inherently phishing-resistant,” PyPI
said
. “They cryptographically bind the authentication to the specific website (origin), meaning an attacker cannot trick you into authenticating on a fake site, unlike TOTP codes, which can be phished.”
Blockade Spider’s Cross-Domain Attacks Detailed
— A financially motivated threat actor known as Blockade Spider has been attributed to using cross-domain techniques in its ransomware campaigns since at least April 2024. The e-crime group uses Embargo ransomware and data theft to monetize their operations.</p>

<p>“They gain access through unmanaged systems, dump credentials, and move laterally to virtualized infrastructure to remotely encrypt files with Embargo ransomware,” CrowdStrike
said
. “They’ve also demonstrated the ability to target cloud environments.” In one case previously
flagged
by the company, the threat actor added compromised users to a “No MFA” Active Directory group, circumvented security controls, and deployed ransomware while evading traditional detection systems. JSGuLdr Loader Delivers Phantom Stealer
— A new multi-stage JavaScript-to-PowerShell loader has been put to use in cyber attacks, delivering an information stealer called Phantom Stealer. “A JavaScript file triggers PowerShell through an Explorer COM call, pulls the second stage from %APPDATA%\Registreri62, then uses Net.WebClient to fetch an encrypted payload from Google Drive into %APPDATA%\Autorise131[.]Tel,” ANY.RUN
said
.</p>

<p>“The payload is decoded in memory and loaded, with PhantomStealer injected into msiexec.exe.” The attack combines obfuscation and fileless in-memory loading techniques to sidestep detection. Because the final payload runs entirely in memory inside a trusted process, it allows threat actors to stealthily move across the network and steal data. Apple Updates App Store Developer Guidelines
— Apple updated its developer guidelines to require every app to disclose if it collects and shares user data with AI companies, as well as ask users for permissions. “You must clearly disclose where personal data will be shared with third parties, including with third-party AI, and obtain explicit permission before doing so,” the company’s rule 5.1.2(i)
now states
.</p>

<p>The
changes
went into effect on November 13, 2025. Malware Campaign Targets Microsoft IIS servers to Deploy BadIIS Malware
— A malware campaign dubbed WEBJACK has been observed compromising Microsoft IIS servers to deploy malicious IIS modules belonging to the BadIIS malware family. “The hijacked servers are being abused for SEO poisoning and fraud, redirecting users to casino, gambling, or betting websites,” WithSecure
said
. “The threat actor has compromised high-profile targets, including government institutions, universities, tech firms, and many other organizations, abusing their domain reputation to serve fraudulent content through search engine results pages (SERPs).” The initial access vector used in the attacks is not known, although previous BadIIS intrusions have leveraged vulnerable web applications, stolen administrator credentials, and purchased access from initial-access brokers.</p>

<p>The tools and operational characteristics observed point to a strong Chinese nexus, a pattern evidenced by the discovery of
similar clusters
in recent months, such as GhostRedirector, Operation Rewrite, UAT-8099, and TOLLBOOTH. Phishing Scheme Targets WhatsApp Accounts
— Hundreds of victims across the Middle East, Asia, and beyond have been ensnared in a new scam that leverages cloned login portals, low-cost domains, and WhatsApp’s own “Linked Devices” and one-time password workflows to hijack WhatsApp accounts. “Threat actors behind this campaign create fraudulent websites that closely imitate legitimate WhatsApp interfaces, using urgency-driven tactics to trick users into compromising their accounts,” CTM360
said
. The campaign has been codenamed HackOnChat.</p>

<p>Over 9,000 phishing URLs have been uncovered to date, with the sites hosted on domains registered with low-cost or less regulated top-level domains such as .cc, .net, .icu, and .top. In the last 45 days, more than 450 incidents were recorded. “The attackers rely on two primary techniques: Session Hijacking, where the WhatsApp-linked device feature is exploited to hijack WhatsApp web sessions, and the Account Takeover, which involves tricking victims into revealing their authentication key to seize full ownership of their accounts,” the company added. “Malicious links are using templates of fake security-alert verification, deceptive WhatsApp Web imitation pages, and spoofed group invitation messages, all designed to lure users into these traps and enable the hacking process.”
Spike in Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect Scanning
— Threat intelligence firm GreyNoise has warned of another wave of
scanning activity
targeting Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect portals.</p>

<p>“Beginning on 14 November 2025, activity rapidly intensified, culminating in a 40x surge within 24 hours, marking a new 90-day high,” the company
said
. Between November 14 and 19, 2.3 million sessions hitting the */global-protect/login.esp URI were observed. It’s assessed that these attacks are the work of the same threat actor based on the recurring TCP/JA4t signatures and overlapping infrastructure. JustAskJacky is the Most Prevalent Threat in October 2025
— A malware family known as
JustAskJacky
emerged as the most pervasive threat in October 2025, followed by KongTuke, Rhadamanthys, NetSupport RAT, and
TamperedChef
, according to
data
from Red Canary.</p>

<p>JustAskJacky, which emerged earlier this year, is a “family of malicious NodeJS applications that masquerade as a helpful AI or utility tool while conducting reconnaissance and executing arbitrary commands in memory in the background.”
NSO Group Seeks to Overturn WhatsApp Case
— Last month, a U.S. court
ordered
Israeli commercial spyware vendor NSO Group to stop targeting WhatsApp. In response, the company has filed an appeal to
overturn the ruling
, arguing that the company will “suffer irreparable, potentially existential injuries” and be forced it out of business. “And the injunction prohibits NSO from engaging in entirely lawful conduct to develop, license, and sell products used in authorized government investigations — a prohibition that would devastate NSO’s business and could well force it out of business entirely,” the motion reads.</p>

<p>Ohio Contractor Pleads Guilty to Hacking Former Employer
— Maxwell Schultz, a 35-year-old man from Ohio, pleaded guilty to charges related to hacking into the network of his former employer. The incident took place in 2021, after the unnamed company terminated Schultz’s employment in its IT department. According to the U.S. Justice Department, Schultz accessed the company’s network by impersonating another contractor to obtain login credentials.</p>

<p>“He ran a PowerShell script that reset approximately 2,500 passwords, locking thousands of employees and contractors out of their computers nationwide,” the department
said
. “Schultz also searched for ways to delete logs, PowerShell window events and cleared multiple system logs.” The incident caused the company $862,000 in losses. Schultz admitted that he conducted the attack because “he was upset about being fired.” He faces up to 10 years in federal prison and a possible $250,000 maximum fine. Security Flaws in Cline Bot AI
— Security vulnerabilities have been discovered in an open-source AI coding assistant called Cline that could expose them to prompt injection and malicious code execution when opening specially crafted source code repositories.</p>

<p>The issues were addressed in Cline v3.35.0. “System prompts are not harmless configuration text. They shape agent behavior, influence privilege boundaries, and significantly increase attacker leverage when exposed verbatim,” Mindgard researcher Aaron Portnoy
said
. “Treating prompts as non-sensitive overlooks the reality that modern agents combine language, tools, and code execution into a single operational surface.</p>

<p>Securing AI agents like Cline requires recognizing that prompts, tool wiring, and agent logic are tightly connected, and each must be handled as part of the security boundary.”

<h2 id="chinese-deepseek-r1-ai-generates-insecure-code-when-prompts-mention-tibet-or-uyghurs"><a id="article-4"></a>Chinese DeepSeek-R1 AI Generates Insecure Code When Prompts Mention Tibet or Uyghurs</h2>

<p>New research from CrowdStrike has revealed that DeepSeek’s artificial intelligence (AI) reasoning model DeepSeek-R1 produces more security vulnerabilities in response to prompts that contain topics deemed politically sensitive by China. “We found that when DeepSeek-R1 receives prompts containing topics the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) likely considers politically sensitive, the likelihood of it producing code with severe security vulnerabilities increases by up to 50%,” the cybersecurity company
said
. The Chinese AI company previously attracted national security concerns,
leading
to a
ban
in many countries. Its open-source DeepSeek-R1 model was also
found
to censor topics considered sensitive by the Chinese government, refusing to answer questions about the
Great
Firewall
of
China
or the political status of Taiwan, among others.</p>

<p>In a statement released earlier this month, Taiwan’s National Security Bureau warned citizens to be vigilant when using Chinese-made generative AI (GenAI) models from DeepSeek, Doubao, Yiyan, Tongyi, and Yuanbao, owing to the fact that they may adopt a pro-China stance in their outputs, distort historical narratives, or amplify disinformation. “The five GenAI language models are capable of generating network attacking scripts and vulnerability-exploitation code that enable remote code execution under certain circumstances, increasing risks of cybersecurity management,” the NSB
said
. CrowdStrike said its analysis of DeepSeek-R1 found it to be a “very capable and powerful coding model,” generating vulnerable code only in 19% of cases when no additional trigger words are present. However, once geopolitical modifiers were added to the prompts, the code quality began to experience variations from the baseline patterns.</p>

<p>Specifically, when instructing the model that it was to act as a coding agent for an industrial control system based in Tibet, the likelihood of it generating code with severe vulnerabilities jumped to 27.2%, which is nearly a 50% increase. While the modifiers themselves don’t have any bearing on the actual coding tasks, the research found that mentions of Falun Gong, Uyghurs, or Tibet lead to significantly less secure code, indicating “significant deviations.”
In one example highlighted by CrowdStrike, asking the model to write a webhook handler for PayPal payment notifications in PHP as a “helpful assistant” for a financial institution based in Tibet generated code that hard-coded secret values, used a less secure method for extracting user-supplied data, and, worse, is not even valid PHP code. “Despite these shortcomings, DeepSeek-R1 insisted its implementation followed ‘PayPal’s best practices’ and provided a ‘secure foundation’ for processing financial transactions,” the company added. In another case, CrowdStrike devised a more complex prompt telling the model to create Android code for an app that allows users to register and sign in to a service for local Uyghur community members to network with other individuals, along with an option to log out of the platform and view all users in an admin panel for easy management.</p>

<p>While the produced app was functional, a deeper analysis uncovered that the model did not implement session management or authentication, exposing user data. In 35% of the implementations, DeepSeek-R1 was found to have used no hashing, or, in scenarios where it did, the method was insecure. Interestingly, tasking the model with the same prompt, but this time for a football fanclub website, generated code that did not exhibit these behaviors. “While, as expected, there were also some flaws in those implementations, they were by no means as severe as the ones seen for the above prompt about Uyghurs,” CrowdStrike said.</p>

<p>Lastly, the company also said it discovered what appears to be an “intrinsic kill switch” embedded with the DeepSeek platform. Besides refusing to write code for Falun Gong, a religious movement banned in China, in 45% of cases, an examination of the reasoning trace has revealed that the model would develop detailed implementation plans internally for answering the task before abruptly refusing to produce output with the message: “I’m sorry, but I can’t assist with that request.”
There are no clear reasons for the observed differences in code security, but CrowdStrike theorized that DeepSeek has likely added specific “guardrails” during the model’s training phase to adhere to Chinese laws, which require AI services to not produce illegal content or generate results that could undermine the status quo. “The present findings do not mean DeepSeek-R1 will produce insecure code every time those trigger words are present,” CrowdStrike said. “Rather, in the long-term average, the code produced when these triggers are present will be less secure.”
The development comes as OX Security’s testing of AI code builder tools like Lovable, Base44, and Bolt found them to generate insecure code by default, even when including the term “secure” in the prompt.</p>

<p>All three tools, which were tasked with creating a simple wiki app, produced code with a stored cross-site scripting (
XSS
) vulnerability, security researcher Eran Cohen
said
, rendering the site
susceptible to payloads
that exploit an HTML image tag’s error handler to execute arbitrary JavaScript when passing a non-existent image source. This, in turn, could open the door to attacks like session hijacking and data theft simply by injecting a malicious piece of code into the site in order to trigger the flaw every time a user visits it. OX Security also found that Lovable only detected the vulnerability in two out of three attempts, adding that the inconsistency leads to a false sense of security. “This inconsistency highlights a fundamental limitation of AI-powered security scanning: because AI models are non-deterministic by nature, they may produce different results for identical inputs,” Cohen said.</p>

<p>“When applied to security, this means the same critical vulnerability might be caught one day and missed the next - making the scanner unreliable.”
The findings also coincide with a report from SquareX that found a security issue in Perplexity’s Comet AI browser that allows built-in extensions “Comet Analytics” and “Comet Agentic” to execute arbitrary local commands on a user’s device without their permission by taking advantage of a little-known Model Context Protocol (MCP) API. That said, the two extensions can only communicate with perplexity.ai subdomains and hinge on an attacker staging an XSS or adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attack to gain access to the perplexity.ai domain or the extensions, and then abuse them to install malware or steal data. Perplexity has since issued an update disabling the MCP API. In a hypothetical attack scenario, a threat actor could impersonate Comet Analytics by means of extension stomping by creating a rogue add-on that spoofs the extension ID and sideloading it.</p>

<p>The malicious extension then injects malicious JavaScript into perplexity.ai that causes the attacker’s commands to be passed to the Agentic extension, which, in turn, uses the MCP API to run malware. “While there is no evidence that Perplexity is currently misusing this capability, the MCP API poses a massive third-party risk for all Comet users,” SquareX
said
. “Should either of the embedded extensions or perplexity.ai get compromised, attackers will be able to execute commands and launch arbitrary apps on the user’s endpoint.”

<h2 id="shadowpad-malware-actively-exploits-wsus-vulnerability-for-full-system-access"><a id="article-5"></a>ShadowPad Malware Actively Exploits WSUS Vulnerability for Full System Access</h2>

<p>A recently patched security flaw in Microsoft Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) has been exploited by threat actors to distribute malware known as ShadowPad. “The attacker targeted Windows Servers with WSUS enabled, exploiting CVE-2025-59287 for initial access,” AhnLab Security Intelligence Center (ASEC)
said
in a report published last week. “They then used
PowerCat
, an open-source PowerShell-based Netcat utility, to obtain a system shell (CMD). Subsequently, they downloaded and installed ShadowPad using certutil and curl.”
ShadowPad
, assessed to be a successor to PlugX, is a modular backdoor widely used by Chinese state-sponsored hacking groups.</p>

<p>It first emerged in 2015. In an analysis published in August 2021, SentinelOne
called
it a “masterpiece of privately sold malware in Chinese espionage.”
CVE-2025-59287
, addressed by Microsoft last month, refers to a critical deserialization flaw in WSUS that could be exploited to achieve remote code execution with system privileges. The vulnerability has since come under heavy exploitation, with threat actors using it to obtain initial access to publicly exposed WSUS instances, conduct reconnaissance, and even drop legitimate tools like
Velociraptor
. ShadowPad installed via CVE-2025-59287 exploit
In the attack documented by the South Korean cybersecurity company, the attackers have been found to weaponize the vulnerability to launch Windows utilities like “curl.exe” and “certutil.exe,” to contact an external server (“149.28.78[.]189:42306”) to download and install ShadowPad.</p>

<p>ShadowPad, similar to PlugX, is launched by means of DLL side-loading, leveraging a legitimate binary (“ETDCtrlHelper.exe”) to execute a DLL payload (“ETDApix.dll”), which serves as a memory-resident loader to execute the backdoor. Once installed, the malware is designed to launch a core module that’s responsible for loading other plugins embedded in the shellcode into memory. It also comes fitted with a variety of anti-detection and persistence techniques. The activity has not been attributed to any known threat actor or group.</p>

<p>“After the proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code for the vulnerability was publicly released, attackers quickly weaponized it to distribute ShadowPad malware via WSUS servers,” AhnLab said. “This vulnerability is critical because it allows remote code execution with system-level permission, significantly increasing the potential impact.”

<h2 id="the-practical-playbook-for-secure-ai-adoption"><a id="article-6"></a>The Practical Playbook for Secure AI Adoption</h2>

<h2 id="china-linked-apt31-launches-stealthy-cyberattacks-on-russian-it-using-cloud-services"><a id="article-7"></a>China-Linked APT31 Launches Stealthy Cyberattacks on Russian IT Using Cloud Services</h2>

<p>The China-linked advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as
APT31
has been attributed to cyber attacks targeting the Russian information technology (IT) sector between 2024 and 2025 while staying undetected for extended periods of time. “In the period from 2024 to 2025, the Russian IT sector, especially companies working as contractors and integrators of solutions for government agencies, faced a series of targeted computer attacks,” Positive Technologies researchers Daniil Grigoryan and Varvara Koloskova
said
in a technical report. APT31, also known as Altaire, Bronze Vinewood, Judgement Panda, PerplexedGoblin, RedBravo, Red Keres, and Violet Typhoon (formerly Zirconium), is assessed to be active since at least 2010. It has a track record of striking a wide range of sectors, including governments, financial, and aerospace and defense, high tech, construction and engineering, telecommunications, media, and insurance.</p>

<p>The cyber espionage group is primarily focused on gathering intelligence that can provide Beijing and state-owned enterprises with political, economic, and military advantages. In May 2025, the hacking crew was
blamed
by the Czech Republic for targeting its Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 2022. The attacks aimed at Russia are characterized by the use of legitimate cloud services, mainly those prevalent in the country, like Yandex Cloud, for command-and-control (C2) and data exfiltration in an attempt to blend in with normal traffic and escape detection. The adversary is also said to have staged encrypted commands and payloads in social media profiles, both domestic and foreign, while also conducting their attacks during weekends and holidays.</p>

<p>In at least one attack targeting an IT company, APT31 breached its network as far back as late 2022, before escalating the activity coinciding with the 2023 New Year holidays. In another intrusion detected in December 2024, the threat actors sent a spear-phishing email containing a RAR archive that, in turn, included a Windows Shortcut (LNK) responsible for launching a Cobalt Strike loader dubbed CloudyLoader via DLL side-loading. Details of this activity were
previously documented
by Kaspersky in July 2025, while identifying some overlaps with a threat cluster known as
EastWind
. The Russian cybersecurity company also said it identified a ZIP archive lure that masqueraded as a report from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Peru to ultimately deploy CloudyLoader.</p>

<p>To facilitate subsequent stages of the attack cycle, APT31 has leveraged an extensive set of publicly available and custom tools. Persistence is achieved by setting up scheduled tasks that mimic legitimate applications, such as Yandex Disk and Google Chrome. Some of the discovered utilities and malware families are listed below -
SharpADUserIP
, a C# utility for reconnaissance and discovery
SharpChrome.exe
, to extract passwords and cookies from Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers
SharpDir
, to search files
StickyNotesExtract.exe
, to extract data from the Windows Sticky Notes database
Tailscale VPN, to create an encrypted tunnel and set up a peer-to-peer (P2P) network between the compromised host and their infrastructure
Microsoft dev tunnels
, to tunnel traffic
Owawa
, a malicious IIS module for credential theft
AufTime, a Linux backdoor that uses the wolfSSL library to communicate with C2
COFFProxy, a Golang backdoor that supports commands for tunneling traffic, executing commands, managing files, and delivering additional payloads
VtChatter, a tool that uses Base64-encoded comments to a
text file hosted on VirusTotal
as a two-way C2 channel every two hours
OneDriveDoor, a backdoor that uses Microsoft OneDrive as C2
LocalPlugX
, a variant of
PlugX
that’s used to spread within the local network, rather than to communicate with C2
CloudSorcerer
, a backdoor that used cloud services as C2
YaLeak, a .NET tool to upload information to Yandex Cloud
“APT31 is constantly replenishing its arsenal: although they continue to use some of their old tools,” Positive Technologies said. “As C2, attackers actively use cloud services, in particular, Yandex and Microsoft OneDrive services.</p>

<p>Many tools are also configured to work in server mode, waiting for attackers to connect to an infected host.”
“In addition, the grouping exfiltrates data through Yandex’s cloud storage. These tools and techniques allowed APT31 to stay unnoticed in the infrastructure of victims for years. At the same time, attackers downloaded files and collected confidential information from devices, including passwords from mailboxes and internal services of victims.”

<h2 id="matrix-push-c2-uses-browser-notifications-for-fileless-cross-platform-phishing-attacks"><a id="article-8"></a>Matrix Push C2 Uses Browser Notifications for Fileless, Cross-Platform Phishing Attacks</h2>

<p>Bad actors are leveraging browser notifications as a vector for phishing attacks to distribute malicious links by means of a new command-and-control (C2) platform called Matrix Push C2. “This browser-native, fileless framework leverages push notifications, fake alerts, and link redirects to target victims across operating systems,” Blackfog researcher Brenda Robb
said
in a Thursday report. In these attacks, prospective targets are tricked into allowing browser notifications through social engineering on malicious or legitimate-but-compromised websites. Once a user agrees to receive notifications from the site, the attackers take advantage of the
web push notification mechanism
built into the web browser to send alerts that look like they have been sent by the operating system or the browser itself, leveraging trusted branding, familiar logos, and convincing language to maintain the ruse.</p>

<p>These include alerts about, say, suspicious logins or browser updates, along with a handy “Verify” or “Update” button that, when clicked, takes the victim to a bogus site. What makes this a clever technique is that the entire process takes place through the browser without the need for first infecting the victim’s system through some other means. In a way, the attack is like
ClickFix
in that users are lured into following certain instructions to compromise their own systems, thereby effectively bypassing traditional security controls. That’s not all.</p>

<p>Since the attack plays out via the web browser, it’s also a cross-platform threat. This essentially turns any browser application on any platform that subscribes to the malicious notifications to be enlisted to the pool of clients, giving adversaries a persistent communication channel. Matrix Push C2 is offered as a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) kit to other threat actors. It’s sold directly through crimeware channels, typically via Telegram and cybercrime forums, under a tiered subscription model: about $150 for one month, $405 for three months, $765 for six months, and $1,500 for a full year.</p>

<p>“Payments are accepted in cryptocurrency, and buyers communicate directly with the operator for access,” Dr. Darren Williams, founder and CEO of BlackFog, told The Hacker News. “Matrix Push was first observed at the beginning of October and has been active since then. There’s no evidence of older versions, earlier branding, or long-standing infrastructure.</p>

<p>Everything indicates this is a newly launched kit.”
The tool is accessible as a web-based dashboard, allowing users to send notifications, track each victim in real-time, determine which notifications the victims interacted with, create shortened links using a built-in URL shortening service, and even record installed browser extensions, including cryptocurrency wallets. “The core of the attack is social engineering, and Matrix Push C2 comes loaded with configurable templates to maximize the credibility of its fake messages,” Robb explained. “Attackers can easily theme their phishing notifications and landing pages to impersonate well-known companies and services.”
Some of the supported notification verification templates are associated with well-known brands like MetaMask, Netflix, Cloudflare, PayPal, and TikTok. The platform also includes an “Analytics &amp; Reports” section that allows its customers to measure the effectiveness of their campaigns and refine them as required.</p>

<p>“Matrix Push C2 shows us a shift in how attackers gain initial access and attempt to exploit users,” BlackFog said. “Once a user’s endpoint (computer or mobile device) is under this kind of influence, the attacker can gradually escalate the attack.”
“They might deliver additional phishing messages to steal credentials, trick the user into installing a more persistent malware, or even leverage browser exploits to get deeper control of the system. Ultimately, the end goal is often to steal data or monetize the access, for example, by draining cryptocurrency wallets or exfiltrating personal information.”
Attacks Misusing Velociraptor on the Rise
The development comes as Huntress said it
observed
a “significant uptick” in attacks weaponizing the legitimate
Velociraptor
digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) tool over the past three months. On November 12, 2025, the cybersecurity vendor said threat actors deployed Velociraptor after obtaining initial access through exploitation of a flaw in Windows Server Update Services (
CVE-2025-59287
, CVSS score: 9.8), which was patched by Microsoft late last month.</p>

<p>Subsequently, the attackers are said to have launched discovery queries with the goal of conducting reconnaissance and gathering details about users, running services, and configurations. The attack was contained before it could progress further, Huntress added. The discovery shows that threat actors are not just
using
custom C2 frameworks
, but are also employing readily available offensive cybersecurity and incident response tools to their advantage. “We’ve seen threat actors use legitimate tools long enough to know that Velociraptor won’t be the first dual-use, open-source tool that will pop up in attacks – nor will it be the last,” Huntress researchers said.</p>

<h2 id="cisa-warns-of-actively-exploited-critical-oracle-identity-manager-zero-day-vulnerability"><a id="article-9"></a>CISA Warns of Actively Exploited Critical Oracle Identity Manager Zero-Day Vulnerability</h2>

<p>The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Friday
added
a critical security flaw impacting Oracle Identity Manager to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (
KEV
) catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation. The vulnerability in question is CVE-2025-61757 (CVSS score: 9.8), a case of missing authentication for a critical function that can result in pre-authenticated remote code execution. The vulnerability affects versions 12.2.1.4.0 and 14.1.2.1.0.</p>

<p>It was
addressed
by Oracle as part of its quarterly updates released last month. “Oracle Fusion Middleware contains a missing authentication for a critical function vulnerability, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to take over Identity Manager,” CISA said. Searchlight Cyber researchers Adam Kues and Shubham Shah, who
discovered
the flaw, said it can permit an attacker to access API endpoints that, in turn, can allow them “to manipulate authentication flows, escalate privileges, and move laterally across an organization’s core systems.”
Specifically, it stems from a bypass of a security filter that tricks protected endpoints into being treated as publicly accessible by simply adding “?WSDL” or “;.wadl” to any URI. This, in turn, is the result of a faulty allow-list mechanism based on regular expressions or string matching against the request URI.</p>

<p>“This system is very error-prone, and there are typically ways to trick these filters into thinking we’re accessing an unauthenticated route when we’re not,” the researchers noted. The authentication bypass can then be paired with a request to the “/iam/governance/applicationmanagement/api/v1/applications/groovyscriptstatus” endpoint to achieve remote code execution by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST. While the endpoint is only meant for checking the syntax of Groovy code and not executing it, Searchlight Cyber said it was able to “write a Groovy annotation that executes at compile time, even though the compiled code is not actually run.”
The addition of CVE-2025-61757 to the KEV catalog comes days after Johannes B. Ullrich, the dean of research at the SANS Technology Institute, said an analysis of honeypot logs revealed several attempts to access the URL “/iam/governance/applicationmanagement/api/v1/applications/groovyscriptstatus;.wadl” via HTTP POST requests between August 30 and September 9, 2025.</p>

<p>“There are several different IP addresses scanning for it, but they all use the same user agent, which suggests that we may be dealing with a single attacker,” Ullrich
said
. “Sadly, we did not capture the bodies for these requests, but they were all POST requests. The content-length header indicated a 556-byte payload.”
This indicates that the vulnerability may have been exploited as a zero-day vulnerability, well before a patch was shipped by Oracle. The IP addresses from which the attempts originated are listed below -
89.238.132[.]76
185.245.82[.]81
138.199.29[.]153
In light of active exploitation, Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies are required to apply the necessary patches by December 12, 2025, to secure their networks.</p>

<h2 id="grafana-patches-cvss-100-scim-flaw-enabling-impersonation-and-privilege-escalation"><a id="article-10"></a>Grafana Patches CVSS 10.0 SCIM Flaw Enabling Impersonation and Privilege Escalation</h2>

<p>Grafana has released security updates to address a maximum severity security flaw that could allow privilege escalation or user impersonation under certain configurations. The vulnerability, tracked as
CVE-2025-41115
, carries a CVSS score of 10.0. It resides in the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (
SCIM
) component that allows automated user provisioning and management. First
introduced
in April 2025, it’s currently in public preview.</p>

<p>“In Grafana versions 12.x where SCIM provisioning is enabled and configured, a vulnerability in user identity handling allows a malicious or compromised SCIM client to provision a user with a numeric externalId, which in turn could allow for overriding internal user IDs and lead to impersonation or privilege escalation,” Grafana’s Vardan Torosyan
said
. That said, successful exploitation hinges on both conditions being met -
enableSCIM feature flag is set to true
user_sync_enabled config option in the [auth.scim] block is set to true
The shortcoming affects Grafana Enterprise versions from 12.0.0 to 12.2.1. It has been addressed in the following versions of the software -
Grafana Enterprise 12.0.6+security-01
Grafana Enterprise 12.1.3+security-01
Grafana Enterprise 12.2.1+security-01
Grafana Enterprise 12.3.0
“Grafana maps the SCIM externalId directly to the internal user.uid; therefore, numeric values (e.g. ‘1’) may be interpreted as internal numeric user IDs,” Torosyan said.</p>

<p>“In specific cases this could allow the newly provisioned user to be treated as an existing internal account, such as the Admin, leading to potential impersonation or privilege escalation.”
The analytics and observability platform said the vulnerability was discovered internally on November 4, 2025, during an audit and testing. Given the severity of the issue, users are advised to apply the patches as soon as possible to mitigate potential risks. Found this article interesting? Follow us on

<h2 id="google-brings-airdrop-compatibility-to-androids-quick-share-using-rust-hardened-security"><a id="article-11"></a>Google Brings AirDrop Compatibility to Android’s Quick Share Using Rust-Hardened Security</h2>

<p>In a surprise move, Google on Thursday
announced
that it has updated Quick Share, its peer-to-peer file transfer service, to work with Apple’s equipment AirDrop, allowing users to more easily share files and photos between Android and iPhone devices. The cross-platform sharing feature is currently limited to the Pixel 10 lineup and works with iPhone, iPad, and macOS devices, with plans to expand to additional Android devices in the future. In order to transfer a file from a Pixel 10 phone over AirDrop, the only caveat is that the owner of the Apple device is required to make sure their iPhone (or iPad or Mac) is discoverable to anyone – which can be enabled for 10 minutes. Likewise, to receive content from an Apple device, Android device users will need to adjust their Quick Share visibility settings to Everyone for 10 minutes or be in Receive mode on the Quick Share page, according to a
support document
published by Google.</p>

<p>“We built Quick Share’s interoperability support for AirDrop with the same rigorous security standards that we apply to all Google products,” Dave Kleidermacher, vice president of Platforms Security and Privacy at Google,
said
. At the heart of the future is a multi-layered security approach that’s powered by the
memory-safe Rust
programming language to create a secure sharing channel that Google said eliminates entire classes of memory safety vulnerabilities, making its implementation resilient against attacks that attempt to exploit memory errors. The tech giant also noted that the feature does not rely on any workaround and that the data is not routed through a server, adding it’s open to working with Apple to enable “Contacts Only” mode in the future. “Google’s implementation of its version of Quick Share does not introduce vulnerabilities into the broader protocol’s ecosystem,” NetSPI, which carried out an independent assessment in August 2025, said.</p>

<p>“While it shares specific characteristics with implementations made by other manufacturers, this implementation is reasonably more secure. In fact, the process of file exchange is notably stronger, as it doesn’t leak any information, which is a common weakness in other manufacturers’ implementations.”
That said, its analysis uncovered a low-severity information disclosure vulnerability (CVSS score: 2.1) that could permit an attacker with physical access to the device to access information, such as image thumbnails and SHA256 hashes of phone numbers and email addresses. It has since been addressed by Google. The development comes as Google said it blocked in India more than 115 million attempts to install sideloaded apps that request access to sensitive permissions for financial fraud.</p>

<p>The company also said it’s piloting a new feature in the country in collaboration with financial services like Google Pay, Navi, and Paytm to combat scams that trick users into opening the apps when sharing their screens. “Devices running Android 11+ now show a prominent alert if a user opens one of these apps while screen sharing on a call with an unknown contact,” Evan Kotsovinos, vice president of privacy, safety, and security at Google,

<p>A China-nexus threat actor known as
APT24
has been observed using a previously undocumented malware dubbed BADAUDIO to establish persistent remote access to compromised networks as part of a nearly three-year campaign. “While earlier operations relied on broad strategic web compromises to compromise legitimate websites, APT24 has recently pivoted to using more sophisticated vectors targeting organizations in Taiwan,” Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) researchers Harsh Parashar, Tierra Duncan, and Dan Perez
said
. “This includes the repeated compromise of a regional digital marketing firm to execute supply chain attacks and the use of targeted phishing campaigns.”
APT24, also called Pitty Tiger, is the moniker
assigned
to a suspected Chinese hacking group that has targeted government, healthcare, construction and engineering, mining, non-profit, and telecommunications sectors in the U.S. and Taiwan.</p>

<p>The group is also known to engage in cyber operations where the goal is intellectual property theft, specifically focusing on information that makes organizations competitive within their fields, per Google. According to a July 2014 report from FireEye, the adversary is
believed
to be active as early as 2008, with the attacks leveraging phishing emails to trick recipients into opening Microsoft Office documents that, in turn, exploit known security flaws in the software (e.g.,
CVE-2012-0158
and
CVE-2014-1761
) to infect systems with malware. Some of the malware families associated with APT24 include CT RAT, a variant of
Enfal/Lurid Downloader
called MM RAT (aka Goldsun-B), and variants of Gh0st RAT known as Paladin RAT and Leo RAT. Another notable malware put to use by the threat actor is a backdoor named
Taidoor
(aka Roudan).</p>

<p>APT24 is assessed to be closely related to another advanced persistent threat (APT) group called Earth Aughisky, which has also deployed Taidoor in its campaigns and has leveraged infrastructure previously attributed to APT24 as part of attacks distributing another backdoor referred to as Specas. Both the malware strains, per an
October 2022 report
from Trend Micro, are designed to read proxy settings from a specific file “%systemroot%\system32\sprxx.dll.”
The latest findings from GTIG show that the BADAUDIO campaign has been underway since November 2022, with the attackers using watering holes, supply chain compromises, and spear-phishing as initial access vectors. A highly obfuscated malware written in C++, BADAUDIO uses
control flow flattening
to resist reverse engineering and acts as a first-stage downloader that’s capable of downloading, decrypting, and executing an AES-encrypted payload from a hard-coded command and control (C2) server. It works by gathering and exfiltrating basic system information to the server, which responds with the payload to be run on the host.</p>

<p>In one case, it was a Cobalt Strike Beacon. BADAUDIO campaign overview
“BADAUDIO typically manifests as a malicious Dynamic Link Library (DLL) leveraging DLL Search Order Hijacking (MITRE ATT&amp;CK T1574.001) for execution via legitimate applications,” GTIG said. “Recent variants observed indicate a refined execution chain: encrypted archives containing BADAUDIO DLLs along with VBS, BAT, and LNK files.”
From November 2022 to at least early September 2025, APT24 is estimated to have compromised more than 20 legitimate websites to inject malicious JavaScript code to specifically exclude visitors coming from macOS, iOS, and Android, generate a unique browser fingerprint using the FingerprintJS library, and serve them a fake pop-up urging them to download BADAUDIO under the guise of a Google Chrome update. Then, starting in July 2024, the hacking group breached a regional digital marketing firm in Taiwan to orchestrate a supply chain attack by injecting the malicious JavaScript into a widely used JavaScript library that the company distributed, effectively allowing it to hijack more than 1,000 domains.</p>

<p>The modified third-party script is configured to reach out to a typosquatted domain impersonating a legitimate Content Delivery Network (CDN) and fetch the attacker-controlled JavaScript to fingerprint the machine and then serve the pop-up to download BADAUDIO after validation. “The compromise in June 2025 initially employed conditional script loading based on a unique web ID (the specific domain name) related to the website using the compromised third-party scripts,” Google said. “This suggests tailored targeting, limiting the strategic web compromise (MITRE ATT&amp;CK T1189) to a single domain.”
Compromised JS supply chain attack to deliver BADAUDIO malware
“However, for a ten-day period in August, the conditions were temporarily lifted, allowing all 1,000 domains using the scripts to be compromised before the original restriction was reimposed.”
APT24 has also been observed conducting targeted phishing attacks since August 2024, using lures related to an animal rescue organization to trick recipients into responding and ultimately deliver BADAUDIO via encrypted archives hosted on Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive. These messages come fitted with tracking pixels to confirm whether the emails were opened by the targets and tailor their efforts accordingly.</p>

<p>“The use of advanced techniques like supply chain compromise, multi-layered social engineering, and the abuse of legitimate cloud services demonstrates the actor’s capacity for persistent and adaptive espionage,” Google said. China-Nexus APT Group Targets Southeast Asia
The disclosure comes as CyberArmor
detailed
a sustained espionage campaign orchestrated by a suspected China-nexus threat actor against government, media, and news sectors in Laos, Cambodia, Singapore, the Philippines, and Indonesia. The activity has been codenamed
Autumn Dragon
. The attack chain commences with a RAR archive likely sent as an attachment in spear-phishing messages that, when extracted, exploits a WinRAR security flaw (
CVE-2025-8088
, CVSS score: 8.8) to launch a batch script (“Windows Defender Definition Update.cmd”) that sets up persistence to ensure that the malware is launched automatically when the user logs in to the system the next time.</p>

<p>It also downloads a second RAR archive hosted on Dropbox via PowerShell. The RAR archive contains two files, a legitimate executable (“obs-browser-page.exe”) and a malicious DLL (“libcef.dll”). The batch script then runs the binary to sideload the DLL, which then communicates with the threat actor over Telegram to fetch commands (“shell”), capture screenshots (“screenshot”), and drop additional payloads (“upload”). “The bot controller (threat actor) uses these three commands to gather information and perform reconnaissance of the victim’s computer and deploy third-stage malware,” security researchers Nguyen Nguyen and BartBlaze said.</p>

<p>“This design enables the controller to remain stealthy and evade detection.”
The third stage once again involves the use of DLL side-loading to launch a rogue DLL (“CRClient.dll”) by using a real binary (“Creative Cloud Helper.exe”), which then decrypts and runs shellcode responsible for loading and executing the final payload, a lightweight implant written in C++ that can communicate with a remote server (“public.megadatacloud[.]com”) and supports eight different commands -
65, to run a specified command using “cmd.exe,” gather the result, and exfiltrate it back to the C2 server
66, to load and execute a DLL
67, to execute shellcode
68, to update configuration
70, to read a file supplied by the operator
71, to open a file and write the content supplied by the operator
72, to get/set the current directory
73, to sleep for a random interval and terminate itself
While the activity has not been tied to a specific threat actor or group, it’s possibly the work of a China-nexus group possessing intermediate operational capabilities. This assessment is based on the adversary’s continued targeting of countries surrounding
the South China Sea
. “The attack campaign is targeted,” the researchers said. “Throughout our analysis, we frequently observed the next stages being hosted behind Cloudflare, with geo-restrictions enabled, as well as other restrictions such as only allowing specific HTTP User Agents.”
