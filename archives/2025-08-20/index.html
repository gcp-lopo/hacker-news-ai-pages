<h2 id="apache-activemq-flaw-exploited-to-deploy-dripdropper-malware-on-cloud-linux-systems"><a id="article-1"></a>Apache ActiveMQ Flaw Exploited to Deploy DripDropper Malware on Cloud Linux Systems</h2>

<p>Threat actors are exploiting a nearly two-year-old security flaw in Apache ActiveMQ to gain persistent access to cloud Linux systems and deploy malware called
DripDropper
. But in an unusual twist, the unknown attackers have been observed patching the exploited vulnerability after securing initial access to prevent further exploitation by other adversaries and evade detection, Red Canary
said
in a report shared with The Hacker News. ‚ÄúFollow-on adversary command-and-control (C2) tools varied by endpoint and included
Sliver
, and Cloudflare Tunnels to maintain covert command and control over the long term,‚Äù researchers Christina Johns, Chris Brook, and Tyler Edmonds said. The attacks exploit a maximum-severity security flaw in Apache ActiveMQ (
CVE-2023-46604
, CVSS score: 10.0), a remote code execution vulnerability that could be exploited to run arbitrary shell commands.</p>

<p>It was addressed in late October 2023. The security defect has since
come under
heavy exploitation, with multiple threat actors leveraging it to deploy a wide range of payloads, including
HelloKitty ransomware
,
Linux rootkits
,
GoTitan
botnet malware, and
Godzilla
web shell. In the attack activity detected by Red Canary, the threat actors have been observed leveraging the access to modify existing sshd configurations to enable root login, granting them elevated access to drop a previously unknown downloader dubbed DripDropper. A PyInstaller Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) binary, DripDropper requires a password to run in a bid to resist analysis.</p>

<p>It also communicated with an attacker-controlled Dropbox account, once again illustrating how threat actors are increasingly relying on legitimate services to blend in with regular network activity and sidestep detection. The downloader ultimately serves as a conduit for two files, one of which facilitates a varied set of actions on different endpoints, ranging from process monitoring to contacting Dropbox for further instructions. Persistence of the dropped file is achieved by modifying the
0anacron
file present in /etc/cron.hourly, /etc/cron.daily, /etc/cron.weekly, /etc/cron.monthly directories. The second file dropped by DripDropper is also designed to contact Dropbox for receiving commands, while also altering existing configuration files related to SSH, likely as a backup mechanism for persistent access.</p>

<p>The final stage entails the attacker downloading from Apache Maven patches for CVE-2023-46604, effectively plugging the flaw. ‚ÄúPatching the vulnerability does not disrupt their operations as they already established other persistence mechanisms for continued access,‚Äù the researchers said. While certainly rare, the technique is not new. Last month, France‚Äôs national cybersecurity agency ANSSI
detailed
a China-nexus initial access broker employing the same approach to secure access to systems and prevent other threat actors from using the shortcomings to get in and mask the initial access vector used in the first place.</p>

<p>The campaign offers a timely reminder for why organizations need to apply patches in a timely fashion, limit access to internal services by configuring ingress rules to trusted IP addresses or VPNs, and monitor logging for cloud environments to flag anomalous activity.

<h2 id="new-godrat-trojan-targets-trading-firms-using-steganography-and-gh0st-rat-code"><a id="article-2"></a>New GodRAT Trojan Targets Trading Firms Using Steganography and Gh0st RAT Code</h2>

<p>Financial institutions like trading and brokerage firms are the target of a new campaign that delivers a previously unreported remote access trojan called
GodRAT
. The malicious activity involves the ‚Äúdistribution of malicious .SCR (screen saver) files disguised as financial documents via Skype messenger,‚Äù Kaspersky researcher Saurabh Sharma
said
in a technical analysis published today. The attacks, which have been active as recently as August 12, 2025, employ a technique called steganography to conceal within image files shellcode used to download the malware from a command-and-control (C2) server. The screen saver artifacts have been detected since September 9, 2024, targeting countries and territories like Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, Malaysia, and Jordan.</p>

<p>Assessed to be based on Gh0st RAT, GodRAT follows a plugin-based approach to augment its functionality in order to harvest sensitive information and deliver secondary payloads like AsyncRAT. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that Gh0st RAT had its source code
leaked
publicly in 2008 and has since been
adopted
by
various Chinese hacking groups
. The Russian cybersecurity company said the malware is an evolution of another Gh0st RAT-based backdoor known as AwesomePuppet that was first documented in 2023 and is likely believed to be the handiwork of the prolific Chinese threat actor,
Winnti
(aka APT41). The screen saver files act as a self-extracting executable incorporating various embedded files, including a malicious DLL that‚Äôs sideloaded by a legitimate executable.</p>

<p>The DLL extracts shellcode hidden within a .JPG image file that then paves the way for the deployment of GodRAT. The trojan, for its part, establishes communication with the C2 server over TCP, collects system information, and pulls the list of installed antivirus software on the host. The captured details are sent to the C2 server, after which the server responds with follow-up instructions that allow it to -
Inject a received plugin DLL into memory
Close the socket and terminate the RAT process
Download a file from a provided URL and launch it using the CreateProcessA API
Open a given URL using the shell command for opening Internet Explorer
One of the plugins downloaded by the malware is a FileManager DLL that can enumerate the file system, perform file operations, open folders, and even run searches for files at a specified location. The plugin has also been used to deliver additional payloads, such as a password stealer for Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers and the AsyncRAT trojan.</p>

<p>Kaspersky said it discovered the complete source code for the GodRAT client and builder that was
uploaded
to the VirusTotal online malware scanner in late July 2024. The builder can be used to generate either an executable file or a DLL. When the executable option is chosen, users have the choice of selecting a legitimate binary from a list to which the malicious code is injected into: svchost.exe, cmd.exe, cscript.exe, curl.exe, wscript.exe, QQMusic.exe and QQScLauncher.exe. The final payload can be saved with one of the following file types: .exe, .com, .bat, .scr, and .pif.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOld implant codebases, such as Gh0st RAT, which are nearly two decades old, continue to be used today,‚Äù Kaspersky said. ‚ÄúThese are often customized and rebuilt to target a wide range of victims.‚Äù
‚ÄúThese old implants are known to have been used by various threat actors for a long time, and the GodRAT discovery demonstrates that legacy codebases like Gh0st RAT can still maintain a long lifespan in the cybersecurity landscape.‚Äù

<h2 id="public-exploit-for-chained-sap-flaws-exposes-unpatched-systems-to-remote-code-execution"><a id="article-3"></a>Public Exploit for Chained SAP Flaws Exposes Unpatched Systems to Remote Code Execution</h2>

<p>A new exploit combining two critical, now-patched security flaws in SAP NetWeaver has emerged in the wild, putting organizations at risk of system compromise and data theft. The exploit in question chains together CVE-2025-31324 and CVE-2025-42999 to bypass authentication and achieve remote code execution, SAP security company Onapsis
said
. CVE-2025-31324
(CVSS score: 10.0) - Missing Authorization check in SAP NetWeaver‚Äôs Visual Composer development server
CVE-2025-42999
(CVSS score: 9.1) - Insecure Deserialization in SAP NetWeaver‚Äôs Visual Composer development server
The vulnerabilities were
addressed
by SAP back in April and May 2025, but not before they were abused by threat actors as zero-days since at least March. Multiple ransomware and data extortion groups, including Qilin, BianLian, and RansomExx, have been
observed
weaponizing the
flaws
, not to mention several
China-nexus espionage crews
who have also put them to use in attacks targeting critical infrastructure networks.</p>

<p>The existence of the exploit was
first reported
last week by vx-underground, which said it was released by Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, a new
fluid alliance
formed by
Scattered Spider
and ShinyHunters. ‚ÄúThese vulnerabilities allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the target SAP System, including the upload of arbitrary files,‚Äù Onapsis said. ‚ÄúThis can lead to remote code execution (RCE) and a complete takeover of the affected system and SAP business data and processes.‚Äù
The exploit, the company added, cannot only be used to deploy web shells, but also be weaponized to conduct living-off-the-land (LotL) attacks by directly executing operating system commands without having to drop additional artifacts on the compromised system. These commands are run with SAP administrator privileges, granting bad actors unauthorized access to SAP data and system resources.</p>

<p>Specifically, the attack chain first uses CVE-2025-31324 to sidestep authentication and upload the malicious payload to the server. The deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2025-42999) is then exploited to unpack the payload and execute it with elevated permissions. ‚ÄúThe publication of this deserialization gadget is particularly concerning due to the fact that it can be reused in other contexts, such as exploiting the deserialization vulnerabilities that were recently patched by SAP in July,‚Äù Onapsis warned. This includes -
CVE-2025-30012
(CVSS score: 10.0)
CVE-2025-42963
(CVSS score: 9.1)
CVE-2025-42964
(CVSS score: 9.1)
CVE-2025-42966
(CVSS score: 9.1)
CVE-2025-42980
(CVSS score: 9.1)
Describing the threat actors as having extensive knowledge of SAP applications, the company is urging SAP users to apply the latest fixes as soon as possible, review and restrict access to SAP applications from the internet, and monitor SAP applications for any signs of compromise.</p>

<h2 id="uk-government-drops-apple-encryption-backdoor-order-after-us-civil-liberties-pushback"><a id="article-4"></a>U.K. Government Drops Apple Encryption Backdoor Order After U.S. Civil Liberties Pushback</h2>

<p>The U.K. government has apparently abandoned its plans to force Apple to weaken encryption protections and include a backdoor that would have enabled access to the protected data of U.S. citizens. U.S.</p>

<p>Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Tulsi Gabbard, in a statement posted on X, said the U.S. government had been working with its partners with the U.K. over the past few months to ensure that Americans‚Äô civil liberties are protected. ‚ÄúAs a result, the U.K.</p>

<p>has agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a ‚Äòbackdoor‚Äô that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties,‚Äù Gabbard
said
. The development comes after Apple
switched off
its Advanced Data Protection (ADP) feature for iCloud in the U.K. earlier this February, following government demands for backdoor access to encrypted user data. ‚ÄúWe are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the U.K., given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy,‚Äù the company was quoted as saying to Bloomberg at the time.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAs we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services, and we never will.‚Äù
The secret order to require Apple to implement a ‚Äúbackdoor‚Äù came in the form of a technical capability notice (TCN) issued by the U.K. Home Office under the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA) to enable blanket access to end-to-end encrypted cloud data, even for users outside the country. The order was issued in January 2025. Critics have argued that enabling access to encrypted cloud data, including backups, essentially amounts to building a backdoor that could be exploited by cybercriminals and authoritarian governments.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs worth noting that the term backdoor here refers to the ability of Apple to respond to legal warrants seeking the content of iCloud accounts that are secured by ADP, which makes it impossible for any third-party, including the tech giant, to decrypt the data. It‚Äôs currently not known if Apple intends to turn ADP back on for British users. Apple has since appealed the legality of the order, with the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT)
denying
the Home Office‚Äôs attempts to keep the case a secret. Late last month, Google
told
TechCrunch that, unlike Apple, it did not receive any request from the U.K.</p>

<p>to weaken encryption protections and allow authorities access to customer data. In a new letter sent to Gabbard, Senator Ron Wyden said Meta ‚Äúoffered an unequivocal denial [‚Ä¶] stating that ‚Äúwe have not received an order to backdoor our encrypted services, like that reported about Apple.‚Äô‚Äù

<h2 id="why-your-security-culture-is-critical-to-mitigating-cyber-risk"><a id="article-5"></a>Why Your Security Culture is Critical to Mitigating Cyber Risk</h2>

<p>After two decades of developing increasingly mature security architectures, organizations are running up against a hard truth: tools and technologies alone are not enough to mitigate cyber risk. As tech stacks have grown more sophisticated and capable, attackers have shifted their focus. They are no longer focusing on infrastructure vulnerabilities alone. Instead, they are increasingly exploiting human behavior.</p>

<p>In most modern breaches, the initial attack vector is not a zero-day technology exploit. It‚Äôs exploiting vulnerabilities in people. The data is well-documented. For five years running,
Verizon‚Äôs Data Breach Investigations Report
has shown that human risk represents the greatest driver of breaches globally.</p>

<p>The latest version of the report found that
nearly 60% of all breaches
in 2024 involved a human element. However, in that context, it‚Äôs important to address a common misconception. The phrase ‚Äúpeople are the weakest link‚Äù implies that employees are at fault when breaches arise. In most cases, that isn‚Äôt the issue.</p>

<p>Users aren‚Äôt failing at security, their security environment is failing them. Too often, security is made unnecessarily complex. Concepts are communicated in a confusing and overwhelming technical language while policies are designed for auditors and lawyers, not the average employee. In turn, effectively mitigating human risk isn‚Äôt a matter of just more technology adoption or policy enforcement.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs about cultivating a strong organizational security culture that simplifies and supports secure human behavior. Until security culture is treated with the same prioritization and investment as your security technology, human risk will continue to undermine even the best-designed technical programs. Defining Security Culture
Every organization already has a security culture in place. The key question is if it‚Äôs the security culture they actually want.</p>

<p>Security culture, by definition, is the shared perceptions, beliefs, and attitudes about cybersecurity across the organization. Do people believe security is important? Do they feel responsible? Do they see themselves as a target?</p>

<p>When that belief structure is strong, behavior follows. But when it‚Äôs missing, like when security is seen as someone else‚Äôs job or an obstacle to productivity, your degree of risk grows exponentially. The problem isn‚Äôt that people don‚Äôt care about protecting their organization. It‚Äôs that security isn‚Äôt embedded into how they work, instead layered on top as something they‚Äôre expected to navigate around.</p>

<p>If we want people to behave securely, we need to create conditions that support those behaviors. Employees adjust their behavior based on what the environment rewards, enables, and expects. Security is no different. To strengthen security culture, the focus should be on designing a day-to-day environment that shapes people‚Äôs perceptions and decisions.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>In practice, this means evaluating the four biggest drivers of your security culture: leadership signals, security team engagement, policy design, and security training. Leadership signals</dt>
  <dd>Culture starts at the top. If leaders treat security as a priority by budgeting for it, tying it to bonuses, or elevating the CISO in the org chart, it sends a clear message. If they don‚Äôt, no amount of lip service will change that perception.</dd>
  <dt>Security team engagement</dt>
  <dd>It‚Äôs not just executives who shape culture. The day-to-day experience people have with security often depends on the security team itself. Is the security team helpful or hostile? Are they clear or confusing?</dd>
  <dt>Are they enablers or blockers? All of that matters. Policy design</dt>
  <dd>Policies are a constant point of interaction. If they‚Äôre overly technical, hard to follow, or full of friction, they erode trust.</dd>
  <dt>If they‚Äôre simple and intuitive, they reinforce the idea that security is achievable. Security training</dt>
  <dd>This is often the most visible part of a program, but also the most misunderstood. If your training is boring, outdated, or irrelevant, it signals that security doesn‚Äôt really matter. When engaging and applicable, it builds belief that drives behavior.</dd>
</dl>

<p>These four areas also provide a framework for measuring your culture. Ask your employees what they think and feel about leadership, the security team, policies, and training. Their answers will tell you whether your culture is working for you or against you. Aligning the Four Levers of Security Culture
Executive support may set the tone, but security culture is defined by what employees encounter day to day.</p>

<p>If those lived experiences are inconsistent with leadership‚Äôs message, belief breaks down. People may hear that security is a priority, but if policies are unclear, training feels disconnected, or security teams are rigid and unapproachable, trust erodes quickly. This is why alignment across all four cultural levers ‚Äì leadership, security team engagement, policy, and training ‚Äì is essential. When leadership visibly prioritizes security, through resourcing and accountability, it signals strategic importance.</p>

<p>But that message needs to be reinforced by how the security team interacts with the workforce. If employees feel punished for mistakes or stonewalled when they ask for support, they are less inclined to be active participants in defending the organization. Policy design plays an equally important role. When policies are long, technical, or impractical, employees will default to convenience even if it introduces risk.</p>

<p>Simpler, more intuitive guidance makes it easier to act securely without slowing down business outcomes. The same principle applies to training. If it‚Äôs outdated or generic, it becomes a check-the-box exercise. But when it‚Äôs relevant and role-specific, it helps reinforce that security is part of the job‚Äînot an add-on to it.</p>

<h2 id="pypi-blocks-1800-expired-domain-emails-to-prevent-account-takeovers-and-supply-chain-attacks"><a id="article-6"></a>PyPI Blocks 1,800 Expired-Domain Emails to Prevent Account Takeovers and Supply Chain Attacks</h2>

<p>The maintainers of the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository have announced that the package manager now checks for expired domains to prevent supply chain attacks. ‚ÄúThese changes improve PyPI‚Äôs overall account security posture, making it harder for attackers to exploit expired domain names to gain unauthorized access to accounts,‚Äù Mike Fiedler, PyPI safety and security engineer at the Python Software Foundation (PSF),
said
. With the latest update, the intention is to tackle domain resurrection attacks, which occur when bad actors purchase an expired domain and use it to take control of PyPI accounts through password resets. PyPI said it has unverified over 1,800 email addresses since early June 2025, as soon as their associated domains entered expiration phases.</p>

<p>While this is not a foolproof solution, it helps plug a significant supply chain attack vector that would otherwise appear legitimate and hard to detect, it added. Email addresses are tied to domain names that, in turn, can lapse, if left unpaid ‚Äì a critical risk for packages distributed via open-source registries. The threat is magnified if those packages have long been abandoned by their respective maintainers, but still enjoy a fair amount of use by downstream developers. PyPI users are required to verify their email addresses during the account registration phase, thus ensuring that the provided addresses are valid and accessible to them.</p>

<p>But this layer of defense is effectively neutralized should the domain expire, thus allowing an attacker to purchase the same domain and initiate a password reset request, which would land in their inbox (as opposed to the actual owner of the package). From there, all the threat actor has to do is follow through the steps to gain access to the account with that domain name. The threat posed by expired domains
arose in 2022
, when an unknown attacker acquired the domain used by the maintainer of the ctx PyPI package to gain access to the account and publish rogue versions to the repository. The latest safeguard added by PyPI aims to prevent this kind of account takeover (ATO) scenario and ‚Äúminimize potential exposure if an email domain does expire and change hands, regardless of whether the account has 2FA enabled.‚Äù It‚Äôs worth noting that the attacks are only applicable to accounts that have registered using email addresses with a custom domain name.</p>

<p>PyPI said it‚Äôs making use of
Fastly‚Äôs Status API
to query the status of a domain every 30 days and mark the corresponding email address as unverified if it has expired. Users of the Python package manager are being advised to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) and add a second verified email address from another notable domain, such as Gmail or Outlook, if the accounts only have a single verified email address from a custom domain name.

<h2 id="noodlophile-malware-campaign-expands-global-reach-with-copyright-phishing-lures"><a id="article-7"></a>Noodlophile Malware Campaign Expands Global Reach with Copyright Phishing Lures</h2>

<p>The threat actors behind the Noodlophile malware are leveraging spear-phishing emails and updated delivery mechanisms to deploy the information stealer in attacks aimed at enterprises located in the U.S., Europe, Baltic countries, and the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region. ‚ÄúThe Noodlophile campaign, active for over a year, now leverages advanced spear-phishing emails posing as copyright infringement notices, tailored with reconnaissance-derived details like specific Facebook Page IDs and company ownership information,‚Äù Morphisec researcher Shmuel Uzan
said
in a report shared with The Hacker News. Noodlophile was
previously detailed
by the cybersecurity vendor in May 2025, uncovering the attackers‚Äô use of fake artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools as lures to propagate the malware. These counterfeit programs were found to be advertised on social media platforms like Facebook.</p>

<p>That said, the adoption of copyright infringement lures is not a new development. Back in November 2024, Check Point
uncovered
a large-scale phishing operation that targeted individuals and organizations under the false premise of copyright infringement violations to drop the Rhadamanthys Stealer. But the latest iteration of the Noodlophile attacks exhibits notable deviation, particularly when it comes to the use of legitimate software vulnerabilities, obfuscated staging via Telegram, and dynamic payload execution. It all starts with a phishing email that seeks to trick employees into downloading and running malicious payloads by inducing a false sense of urgency, claiming copyright violations on specific Facebook Pages.</p>

<p>The messages originate from Gmail accounts in an effort to evade suspicion. Present within the message is a Dropbox link that drops a ZIP or MSI installer, which, in turn, sideloads a malicious DLL using legitimate binaries associated with Haihaisoft PDF Reader to ultimately launch the obfuscated Noodlophile stealer, but not before running batch scripts to establish persistence using Windows Registry. What‚Äôs notable about the attack chain is that it leverages Telegram group descriptions as a
dead drop resolver
to fetch the actual server (‚Äúpaste[.]rs‚Äù) that hosts the stealer payload to challenge detection and takedown efforts. ‚ÄúThis approach builds on the previous campaign‚Äôs techniques (e.g., Base64-encoded archives, LOLBin abuse like certutil.exe), but adds layers of evasion through Telegram-based command-and-control and in-memory execution to avoid disk-based detection,‚Äù Uzan said.</p>

<p>Noodlophile is a full-fledged stealer that can capture data from web browsers and gather system information. Analysis of the stealer source code indicates ongoing development efforts to expand on its capabilities to facilitate screenshot capture, keylogging, file exfiltration, process monitoring, network information gathering, file encryption, and browser history extraction. ‚ÄúThe extensive targeting of browser data underscores the campaign‚Äôs focus on enterprises with significant social media footprints, particularly on platforms like Facebook,‚Äù Morphisec said. ‚ÄúThese unimplemented functions indicate that the stealer‚Äôs developers are actively working to expand its capabilities, potentially transforming it into a more versatile and dangerous threat.‚Äù

<h2 id="microsoft-windows-vulnerability-exploited-to-deploy-pipemagic-ransomexx-malware"><a id="article-8"></a>Microsoft Windows Vulnerability Exploited to Deploy PipeMagic RansomExx Malware</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have lifted the lid on the threat actors‚Äô exploitation of a now-patched security flaw in Microsoft Windows to deploy the PipeMagic malware in RansomExx ransomware attacks. The attacks involve the
exploitation
of CVE-2025-29824, a privilege escalation vulnerability impacting the Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) that was addressed by Microsoft in April 2025,
Kaspersky
and
BI.ZONE
said in a joint report published today. PipeMagic was
first documented
in 2022 as part of RansomExx ransomware attacks targeting industrial companies in Southeast Asia, capable of acting as a full-fledged backdoor providing remote access and executing a wide range of commands on compromised hosts. In those attacks, the threat actors have been found to exploit
CVE-2017-0144
, a remote code execution flaw in Windows SMB, to infiltrate victim infrastructure.</p>

<p>Subsequent infection chains observed in October 2024 in Saudi Arabia were spotted leveraging a fake OpenAI ChatGPT app as bait to deliver the malware. Earlier this April, Microsoft attributed the exploitation of CVE-2025-29824 and the deployment of PipeMagic to a threat actor it tracks as Storm-2460. ‚ÄúOne unique feature of PipeMagic is that it generates a random 16-byte array used to create a named pipe formatted as: \.\pipe\1.&lt;hex string&gt;,‚Äù researchers Sergey Lozhkin, Leonid Bezvershenko, Kirill Korchemny, and Ilya Savelyev said. ‚ÄúAfter that, a thread is launched that continuously creates this pipe, attempts to read data from it, and then destroys it.</p>

<p>This communication method is necessary for the backdoor to transmit encrypted payloads and notifications.‚Äù
PipeMagic is a plugin-based modular malware that uses a domain hosted on the Microsoft Azure cloud provider to stage the additional components, with the 2025 attacks aimed at Saudi Arabia and Brazil relying on a Microsoft Help Index file (‚Äúmetafile.mshi‚Äù) as a loader. The loader, in turn, unpacks C# code that decrypts and executes embedded shellcode. ‚ÄúThe injected shellcode is executable code for 32-bit Windows systems,‚Äù the researchers said. ‚ÄúIt loads an unencrypted executable embedded inside the shellcode itself.‚Äù
Kaspersky said it also uncovered PipeMagic loader artifacts masquerading as a ChatGPT client in 2025 that are similar to those previously seen in October 2024.</p>

<p>The samples have been observed leveraging DLL hijacking techniques to run a malicious DLL that mimics a Google Chrome update file (‚Äúgoogleupdate.dll‚Äù). Irrespective of the loading method used, it all leads to the deployment of the PipeMagic backdoor that supports various modules -
Asynchronous communication module that supports five commands to terminate the plugin, read/write files, terminate a file operation, or terminate all file operations
Loader module to inject additional payloads into memory and execute them
Injector module to launch a C# executable
‚ÄúThe repeated detection of PipeMagic in attacks on organizations in Saudi Arabia and its appearance in Brazil indicate that the malware remains active and that the attackers continue to develop its functionality,‚Äù the researchers said. ‚ÄúThe versions detected in 2025 show improvements over the 2024 version, aimed at persisting in victim systems and moving laterally within internal networks. In the 2025 attacks, the attackers used the ProcDump tool, renamed to dllhost.exe, to extract memory from the LSASS process.‚Äù
PipeMagic, a Sophisticated Malware Framework
Describing PipeMagic as a framework designed for flexibility and persistence, Microsoft said the malware can dynamically execute payloads while maintaining robust command-and-control (C2) communication via a dedicated networking module.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAs the malware receives and loads payload modules from C2, it grants the threat actor granular control over code execution on the compromised host,‚Äù the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team
said
. ‚ÄúBy offloading network communication and backdoor tasks to discrete modules, PipeMagic maintains a modular, stealthy, and highly extensible architecture, making detection and analysis significantly challenging.‚Äù
Storm-2460 attacks span several sectors and geographies, including information technology (IT), financial, and real estate in the U.S., Europe, South America, and Middle East. PipeMagic gets its name from the use of encrypted inter-process communication via
named pipes
. The malware communicates with its C2 server over TCP and receives payload modules through a named pipe and its C2 server.</p>

<p>The payloads are stored in memory using a data structure called
doubly linked list
without leaving any traces on disk. Another module of importance is a network component that‚Äôs used for C2 communications to send data, collect comprehensive system information, and process commands contained within C2 responses that facilitate granular control over module management, execution, and system reconnaissance. ‚ÄúBy offloading network communication and backdoor tasks to discrete modules, PipeMagic maintains a modular, stealthy, and highly extensible architecture, making detection and analysis significantly challenging,‚Äù it added.

Ghost Tap NFC-Based Mobile Fraud Takes Off
‚Äî A new Android trojan called PhantomCard has become the latest malware to abuse near-field communication (NFC) to conduct relay attacks for facilitating fraudulent transactions in attacks targeting banking customers in Brazil.</p>

<p>In these attacks, users who end up installing the malicious apps are instructed to place their credit/debit card on the back of the phone to begin the verification process, only for the card data to be sent to an attacker-controlled NFC relay server. The stolen card details are passed on to money mules who link the information to contactless payment systems like Apple Pay or Google Pay in person to obtain physical goods.

Two N-able N-central Flaws Exploited in the Wild
‚Äî Two security flaws impacting N-able N-central have come under active exploitation in the wild. The flaws, CVE-2025-8875 and CVE-2025-8876, allow command execution and command injection, respectively.</p>

<p>The issues have been addressed in N-central versions 2025.3.1 and 2024.6 HF2 released on August 13, 2025. N-able is also urging customers to make sure that multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled, particularly for admin accounts. New ‚ÄòCurly COMrades‚Äô APT Targets Georgia and Moldova
‚Äî A previously undocumented threat actor dubbed Curly COMrades has been observed targeting entities in Georgia and Moldova as part of a cyber espionage campaign designed to facilitate long-term access to target networks. The activity, tracked by the Romanian cybersecurity company since mid-2024, has singled out judicial and government bodies in Georgia, as well as an energy distribution company in Moldova.</p>

<p>Curly COMrades are assessed to be operating with goals that are aligned with Russia‚Äôs geopolitical strategy. It gets its name from the heavy reliance on the curl utility for command-and-control (C2) and data transfer, and the hijacking of the component object model (COM) objects. Persistent access to the infected endpoints is accomplished by means of a bespoke backdoor called MucorAgent. XZ Utils Backdoor Found in Dozens of Docker Hub Images
‚Äî Several Docker images built around the time of the XZ Utils compromise contain the backdoor, some of which are still available via the container image library Docker Hub.</p>

<p>Binary said it identified 35 Debian images on Docker Hub that embedded the backdoor. That includes 12 Docker images and 23 second-order images. The main takeaway is that users should only rely on up-to-date images. The findings are a sign that traces of the supply chain threat have remained after more than a year since the incident came to light.</p>

<p>U.S. Expands Sanctions on Garantex
‚Äî The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Russian cryptocurrency exchange Garantex, its successor Grinex, and related affiliates as part of continued efforts by the government to halt the flow of ransomware proceeds facilitated by the platforms. Garantex is estimated to have processed more than $100 million in transactions linked to illicit activities since 2019.</p>

<p>‚ÄúDigital assets play a crucial role in global innovation and economic development, and the United States will not tolerate abuse of this industry to support cybercrime and sanctions evasion,‚Äù the Treasury Department said. EncryptHub Continues to Exploit Windows Flaw for Stealer Attacks
‚Äî The Russia-aligned threat actor known as EncryptHub is continuing to exploit a now-patched security flaw impacting Microsoft Windows to deliver malicious payloads, including a stealer called Fickle Stealer. The campaign combines social engineering and the exploitation of a vulnerability in the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) framework (CVE-2025-26633, aka MSC EvilTwin) to trigger the infection routine via a rogue Microsoft Console (MSC) file. ShinyHunters and Scattered Spider Join Forces
‚Äî ShinyHunters and Scattered Spider appear to be working together to carry out financially motivated attacks, including those targeting Salesforce customers.</p>

<p>These include the use of adoption of tactics that mirror those of Scattered Spider, such as highly-targeted vishing (aka voice phishing) and social engineering attacks, leveraging apps that masquerade as legitimate tools, employing Okta-themed phishing pages to trick victims into entering credentials during vishing, and VPN obfuscation for data exfiltration. üî• Trending CVEs
Hackers don‚Äôt wait‚Äîthey strike within hours of a flaw being exposed. A missed patch, a hidden bug, or even a single overlooked CVE is enough to hand them the keys.

Flaws in ZTNA Software
‚Äî Cybersecurity researchers have
discovered
multiple security flaws impacting Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) solutions from Zscaler (
CVE-2025-54982
), NetSkope and Check Point Perimeter 81 that could be abused by attackers to escalate privileges on end user devices and to completely bypass authentication, granting access to internal resources as any user.</p>

<p>The findings follow the
discovery
of critical weaknesses in Cato Networks‚Äô Cato client, including one that could allow an attacker to gain full administrative control of a user‚Äôs device simply by having the user visit a malicious web page. Google Address Promptware Attack
‚Äî Google has
remediated
a serious security issue that allowed maliciously crafted Google Calendar invites to remotely take over Gemini agents running on the target‚Äôs device, leak sensitive user data, and hijack control of smart home systems. The targeted promptware attack is initiated simply by an attacker sending a Google Calendar invite to a victim whose name contains an indirect prompt injection. When Google‚Äôs flagship AI chatbot is asked to summarize its upcoming calendar events, those dormant instructions are triggered, causing havoc in the physical environment, such as remotely controlling a victim‚Äôs home appliances.</p>

<p>The attacks employ an approach called
delayed automatic tool invocation
to get around Google‚Äôs
existing safety measures
. They also demonstrate a potential side effect of Gemini‚Äôs broad permissions to take actions across the Google ecosystem. ‚ÄúAs a result, we were able to hijack the application context, invoke its integrated agents, and exploit their permissions to perform a shocking range of malicious activities ‚Äì including identifying the victim‚Äôs location, recording the victim, and even making changes within the victim‚Äôs physical environment.‚Äù The approach shows that Promptware, a variant of
EchoLeak
, is capable of performing both inter-agent lateral movement, by triggering malicious activity between different Gemini agents, and inter-app lateral movement, by escaping the boundaries of Gemini and leveraging applications installed on a victim‚Äôs smartphone, to perform malicious activities with real-world consequences. The promptware attacks further show that Gemini can be made to send spam links, generate vulgar content, open up the Zoom app and start a call, steal email and meeting details from a web browser, and download a file from a smartphone‚Äôs web browser.</p>

<p>Google has since rolled out fixes like
security thought reinforcement
to address the issues. Indirect prompt injections
are a more serious AI threat, as the malicious prompt is inserted by an outside source, either embedded within a web page or as text in a white font in an email that‚Äôs invisible to the naked eye, but can be parsed by AI systems. Addressing prompt injections is a hard problem since the methods LLMs can be tricked are continually evolving, and the attack surface is simultaneously getting more complex. Matter Adds New Security Features
‚Äî Matter, a unifying, IP-based connectivity protocol and technical standard for smart home and IoT devices, has received
numerous security enhancements
in version 1.4.2, including (1) Wi-Fi Only Commissioning, which enables devices to be onboarded to Matter ecosystems over Wi-Fi without requiring Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) radios, (2) Vendor ID (VID) Verification, which allows controllers to cryptographically verify that the Admins installed on a device are genuinely from the vendors they claim, (3) Access Restriction Lists (ARLs), which provide a mechanism to restrict access to sensitive settings and data to only trusted, verified Controllers, and (4) Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs), which offers support for revoking unused or compromised Device Attestation Certificates.</p>

<p>Smart Buses Can Be Remotely Hacked
‚Äî Cybersecurity researchers have discovered that Taiwanese smart buses that incorporate various systems to improve safety, efficiency, and passenger experience, such as Advanced Public Transportation Services (APTS) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) can be remotely hacked. The
research
showcased
it‚Äôs possible to easily bypass the on-board router‚Äôs authentication and gain unauthorized access to its administration interface, and then take over the APTS and ADAS functionality due to a lack of network segmentation. This enables an attacker to leverage the remote access to track the vehicle‚Äôs movements, manipulate controls, or access the camera. The vulnerabilities impact routers from BEC Technologies, which are commonly installed on smart buses in Taiwan.</p>

<p>Cmimai Stealer Spotted in the Wild
‚Äî A new Visual Basic Script (VBS) stealer malware called Cmimai Stealer has been observed in the wild since June 2025, employing capabilities to harvest a wide range of information from infected hosts and exfiltrating the data using a Discord webhook. ‚ÄúIt is lightweight and lacks advanced features like persistence on system restart, encrypted communication, and credential theft; perhaps by design,‚Äù K7 Security
said
. ‚ÄúAlthough it is collecting browser data and screenshots, making us classify it as an Infostealer, it can be used for the dual purpose as a Stealer and also as a second-stage reconnaissance tool used for strategizing further future attacks.‚Äù
Windows Hello or Windows Hell No? ‚Äî Cybersecurity researchers have
presented
a novel attack targeting Windows Hello for Business (WHfB) that leverages the storage subsystem of the biometric unit in order to conduct bypass attacks.</p>

<p>Essentially, the attack can facilitate biometric injection from another computer that would compromise biometric authentication, granting access to any face or fingerprint submitted. ERNW Research demonstrated that a local admin, or someone who has access to their credentials via malware or other means, can inject biometric information into a computer that would allow it to recognize any face or fingerprint. While the biometric templates are ‚Äúencrypted,‚Äù a local administrator can exchange biometric features in the database, allowing authentication as any user already enrolled in the targeted system, including the possibility to make a lateral movement by usurping a domain administrator. Microsoft‚Äôs Enhanced Sign-in Security (ESS), which operates at a higher hypervisor virtual trust level (VTL1), blocks this line of attack.</p>

<p>Securam Prologic Lock Flaws Disclosed
‚Äî Researchers James Rowley and Mark Omo managed to
discover
a ‚Äúbackdoor‚Äù intended to let authorized locksmiths open Securam Prologic locks used in Liberty Safe and seven other brands. In addition, they discovered a way for a hacker to exploit that backdoor‚Äîintended to be accessible only with the manufacturer‚Äôs help‚Äîto open a safe on their own in seconds, as well as found another security vulnerability in many newer versions of Securam‚Äôs locks that would allow a bad actor to insert a tool into a hidden port in the lock and instantly obtain a safe‚Äôs unlock code, WIRED reported. Securam is expected to fix the issues in future models of the ProLogic lock. UAC Bypass via eudcedit.exe
‚Äî An inventive User Account Control (UAC) bypass method exploits Windows‚Äô built-in Private Character Editor (‚Äúeudcedit.exe‚Äù), allowing attackers to gain elevated privileges without user consent.</p>

<p>The technique once again highlights how legitimate Windows utilities can be weaponized to circumvent critical security mechanisms. ‚ÄúIf eudcedit.exe is executed under a user context that already belongs to the Administrators group, and UAC is configured permissively (e.g., ‚ÄòElevate without prompting‚Äô), Windows will launch it immediately with high integrity, without showing a UAC dialog,‚Äù security researcher Matan Bahar
said
. Information Leak in Multi-User Linux Environments
‚Äî New research has
demonstrated
how basic Linux commands like ‚Äúps auxww‚Äù can be
weaponized
to extract database credentials, API keys, and administrative passwords in multi-user Linux environments, ‚Äúwithout ever escalating privileges or exploiting a single bug,‚Äù according to Ionut Cernica. Privacy Leaks Via Siri
‚Äî Privacy issues have been uncovered in Apple Siri, finding the chat assistant transmits metadata about installed and active open apps, as well as audio playback metadata (e.g., recording names) without the user‚Äôs ability to control these privacy settings or their consent.</p>

<p>What‚Äôs more, messages dictated via Siri to apps like iMessage and WhatsApp are sent to Apple‚Äôs servers, along with the recipient phone number and other identifiers. The issues have been codenamed
AppleStorm
by Lumia Security. Apple said the behavior stemmed from third-party services‚Äô use of SiriKit, its extension system for integrating external apps with Siri. OAuth Apps as a Privilege Escalation Tool
‚Äî Malicious
OAuth applications
could be used to escalate privileges or move laterally within a target environment.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs according to findings from Praetorian, which has open-sourced a red teaming tool called
OAuthSeeker
that performs phishing attacks using malicious OAuth applications to compromise user identities within Microsoft Azure and Office365. ‚ÄúIt is possible for external verified or internal unverified applications to request user_impersonation privileges within Microsoft Azure, which then allows the attacker to impersonate the user to cloud computing resources within Microsoft Azure, such as accessing compute infrastructure, such as virtual machines,‚Äù Praetorian
said
. ‚ÄúOperators can leverage OAuthSeeker for both gaining initial access into an environment, for lateral movement after obtaining initial access, and for persistence purposes after compromising an account leveraging other methods.‚Äù
Fake Minecraft Setup Leads to NjRAT
‚Äî A new malware campaign has been
observed
using fake Minecraft installers or mods to distribute a remote access trojan called
NjRAT
. ‚ÄúIt is written in .NET and allows attackers to fully control infected machines remotely, making it one of the most popular and persistent malware families used in cyber espionage, cybercrime, and surveillance operations,‚Äù Point Wild said.</p>

<p>The disclosure comes as the cybersecurity company
detailed
the inner workings of another RAT called
Sakula RAT
that has been employed in targeted intrusions since at least 2012. Besides harvesting sensitive data, the malware can connect to a command-and-control (C2) server to receive instructions from the attacker to run arbitrary commands and download additional payloads. Israel Targeted by PowerShell RAT Using ClickFix
‚Äî Speaking or RATs, multiple Israeli organizations have been targeted by spear-phishing attacks that direct users to fake landing pages mimicking Microsoft Teams invites, while using
ClickFix
-like lures to trick recipients into launching PowerShell commands under the guise of joining the conversation. The command initiates the retrieval and execution of a secondary PowerShell script from the attacker‚Äôs server, which, in turn, acts as a loader for a PowerShell remote access trojan that can run PowerShell commands from the C2 and run more malware.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe adversary leveraged compromised internal email infrastructure to distribute phishing messages across the regional business landscape,‚Äù Fortinet
said
. ‚ÄúThe attacker systematically compromised multiple Israeli companies over several consecutive days, using each breached environment as a launchpad to target additional organizations in the region. This tactic closely mirrors
MuddyWater
‚Äòs typical approach to lateral expansion.‚Äù The absence of remote management tools (RMMs), a hallmark of MuddyWater‚Äôs attacks, indicates a tactical deviation. The disclosure came as Profero said it
cracked
the encryption of the
DarkBit
(aka Storm-1084) ransomware gang‚Äôs encryptors, allowing victims to recover files for free without paying a ransom.</p>

<p>DarkBit is assessed to share overlaps with MuddyWater. The decrypter exploits a weak key generation algorithm used by the DarkBit group to brute-force the decryption key. Kimsuky Allegedly Suffers Data Breach
‚Äî The North Korean state-sponsored hackers known as
Kimsuky
have reportedly suffered a data breach after a pair of hackers, named Saber and cyb0rg, stole the group‚Äôs data and leaked it publicly online. ‚ÄúKimsuky, you are not a hacker.</p>

<p>You are driven by financial greed, to enrich your leaders, and to fulfill their political agenda,‚Äù the hackers remarked in an analysis
published
in the latest issue of Phrack magazine. ‚ÄúYou steal from others and favour your own. You value yourself above the others: You are morally perverted.‚Äù Among the leaked data are Kimsuky‚Äôs backend, exposing hacking tools, email addresses, internal manuals, and passwords that could provide insight into unknown campaigns and undocumented compromises. Saber and cyb0rg claim to have found evidence of Kimsuky compromising several South Korean government networks and companies.</p>

<p>The files also include the group‚Äôs Android Toybox modifications and use of exploits like Bushfire. Another program is a Loadable Kernel Module (LKM) style rootkit with the ability to hide from detection and operate on any network port. ‚ÄúThe main purpose of the rootkit is to create a persistent and stealthy backdoor,‚Äù Sandfly Security
said
. ‚ÄúThe backdoor is activated when a special magic packet is received, combined with a correct password to initiate an SSL connection.</p>

<p>The backdoor can be activated on any port. This is important to understand because a firewall alone may not protect the target system. If the magic packet is able to hit the victim, then the backdoor may be activated.‚Äù The tranche of data is said to have originated from a virtual workstation and virtual private server (VPS) used by the threat actor. That said,
indications
are that the dumps may have originated from a likely Chinese actor who has knowledge of Kimsuky‚Äôs tradecraft.</p>

<p>2 Founder of Samourai Wallet Plead Guilty to Money Laundering
‚Äî Two senior executives and founders of the Samourai Wallet cryptocurrency mixer have pleaded guilty to charges involving washing more than $200 million worth of crypto assets from criminal proceeds and concealing the nature of illicit transactions using services like Whirlpool and Ricochet. Samourai CEO Keonne Rodriguez and CTO William Lonergan Hill were arrested last year after the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) took down their service. As part of their plea agreements, Rodriguez and Hill have also agreed to forfeit $237,832,360.55.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe defendants created and operated a cryptocurrency mixing service that they knew enabled criminals to wash millions in dirty money, including proceeds from cryptocurrency thefts, drug trafficking operations, and fraud schemes,‚Äù the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ)
said
. ‚ÄúThey did not just facilitate this illicit movement of money, but also encouraged it.‚Äù
Tornado Cash Founder Convicted of Operating a Money Transmitting Business
‚Äî Roman Storm, a co-founder of the cryptocurrency mixing service Tornado Cash, was found guilty of conspiring to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business. However, the jury failed to reach a ruling on the more significant charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering and to violate sanctions.</p>

<p>‚ÄúRoman Storm and Tornado Cash provided a service for North Korean hackers and other criminals to move and hide more than $1 billion of dirty money,‚Äù the DoJ
said
. Storm is set to be sentenced later this year and faces a maximum prison sentence of five years. The development came as the U.S. Treasury Department
dropped
its appeal against a court ruling that forced it to lift sanctions against Tornado Cash last month.</p>

<p>Tornado Cash was
delisted
from the Specially Designated National and Blocked Persons (SDN) list earlier this March. The service was sanctioned in 2022 for its alleged links to cybercriminals and for having ‚Äúrepeatedly failed to impose effective controls‚Äù to prevent money laundering. India‚Äôs UPI to Stop P2P Money Requests to Tackle Fraud
‚Äî The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI)
announced
it will discontinue the person-to-person (P2P) Collect Request feature from the country‚Äôs instant payment system, Unified Payments Interface (UPI), starting October 1, 2025, aiming to strengthen security and prevent payment-related fraud. The feature allows users to request money from another individual via UPI, but has been misused by fraudsters by sending fake money transfer requests that can be inadvertently approved by a simple tap, thereby tricking unwitting users into authorizing payments.</p>

<p>The change, however, does not apply to merchants. Microsoft Plans to Block Dangerous File Types in Teams
‚Äî Microsoft revealed it‚Äôs planning to block
dangerous file types
and
malicious URLs
in Teams chats and channels. ‚ÄúMicrosoft Teams now blocks messages containing weaponizable file types, such as executables, in chats and channels, increasing protection against malware and other file-based attacks,‚Äù the company said. ‚ÄúMicrosoft Teams can now detect and warn users on malicious URLs sent in Teams chat and channels, increasing protection against malware attacks.‚Äù Separately, the tech giant
said
it‚Äôs also integrating Teams with Defender for Office 365 Tenant Allow/Block List to allow administrators to centrally manage blocked external domains in Teams.</p>

<p>USB Worm Delivers Crypto Miner
‚Äî A USB-based worm is being used to deliver the XMRig cryptocurrency miner as part of a global campaign targeting financial, education, healthcare, manufacturing, telecom, and oil and gas sectors in Australia, India, the U.S., and other countries. ‚ÄúThe infection starts with execution of a VB script file from a USB drive (using a file name that starts with x and random 6 digits) from a folder named ‚Äòrootdir,‚Äô‚Äù CyberProof
said
. The attack chain subsequently leverages DLL side-loading techniques to launch a malicious DLL that‚Äôs responsible for starting the mining process. In a related development, Russian companies have become the
target
of the
Kinsing
(aka H2Miner and Resourceful Wolf) cryptojacking group as part of large-scale attacks that brute-force SSH instances or scan internet-exposed servers for known vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2017-9841) in order to drop the Monero cryptocurrency miner.</p>

<p>SMM Flaws in AMI Aptio UEFI Firmware
‚Äî System Management Mode (
SMM
) memory corruption vulnerabilities (
CVE-2025-33043
) have been
identified
in UEFI modules present in AMI Aptio UEFI firmware that could be exploited by an attacker to elevate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the highly privileged SMM environment. ‚ÄúThis could bypass certain firmware-level protections, such as those protecting the SPI flash memory, and enable persistent modifications to the firmware that operate independently of the OS,‚Äù CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC)
said
. Former Intel Engineer Sentenced to 2 Years of Probation for Stealing Trade Secrets
‚Äî An engineer who stole trade secrets from Intel and shared them with his new employer, Microsoft, was
sentenced
to two years of probation and ordered to pay a fine of more than $34,000. Varun Gupta was employed at Intel from July 2010 to January 2020, when he secured his new job at Microsoft.</p>

<p>Gupta pleaded guilty to possessing trade secrets back in February 2025. ‚ÄúBetween February and July 2020, while employed by the company in Washington, Gupta possessed and accessed his previous employer‚Äôs trade secrets and proprietary information without authorization,‚Äù the Justice Department
noted
at the time. ‚ÄúGupta accessed information related to customized product design and pricing for significant purchases of computer processors, which Gupta used, as a representative of the Washington company, during head-to-head negotiations with his previous employer.‚Äù He was sued by Intel in early 2021. GitHub Repositories Deliver Stealer Malware
‚Äî GitHub repositories
disguised
as legitimate projects, including game cheats, software cracks, and automation tools, have been used to distribute a malware loader called SmartLoader.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs believed that users searching for such tools on search engines are the target of the campaign. The loader acts as a conduit for the Rhadamanthys information stealer malware, which is retrieved from a remote server. Users who
search for tools
to download YouTube videos for free have also been found to be served fake sites like YTMP4, where those who enter a video URL are displayed a ‚ÄúDownload Now‚Äù button that drops DigitalPulse proxyware on the victim‚Äôs host by means of an executable hosted on GitHub. In a separate campaign, Facebook ads are
being used
to redirect users to fake landing pages that aim to deceive users into
installing phony versions
of cryptocurrency exchange apps like Binance that contain malware.</p>

<p>The activity overlaps with a threat cluster dubbed
WEEVILPROXY
. Phishing Attacks Use Personalized Subject Lines and Links
‚Äî Phishing attacks have been observed crafting personalized subject lines, attachment names, and embedded links to create a sense of familiarity or urgency, and increase the likelihood that the recipients engage with the email messages. ‚ÄúThis strategy is not limited to the subject line; it is often extended to the email attachments, links, and message body,‚Äù Cofense
said

Clipboard Permissions ‚Äî A Hidden Data Leak Waiting to Happen ‚Äî
Most people think of their clipboard as a harmless convenience ‚Äî copy some text, paste it where you need it, done.</p>

<p>But in modern browsers like Chrome, the clipboard is a shared space between your computer and any website you grant permission to. Once allowed, a site can read whatever is currently in your clipboard ‚Äî not just what you copied from that site, but from anywhere: your password manager, a PDF, a corporate document, or even secure notes. The danger isn‚Äôt just ‚Äútechnical paranoia‚Äù ‚Äî clipboard access is a known target for attackers because it bypasses a lot of security boundaries. If you‚Äôve allowed a site to read your clipboard:
It can read sensitive data from other apps
‚Äî (e.g., passwords, personal IDs, bank info) if that data is in your clipboard while the site is open.</p>

<p>It can read more than what you paste
‚Äî Once permission is granted, a site can read your clipboard when you interact with it (e.g., clicking a button). It can see data copied from anywhere, not just from that site. It‚Äôs silent
‚Äî there‚Äôs no pop-up or alert for each read. You won‚Äôt know it‚Äôs happening.</p>

<p>For example, you allow design-tool[.]com to read your clipboard because you want to paste an image directly into the site. Later in the day, you copy:
A password from your password manager,
A confidential client email snippet,
Or a crypto wallet address. While you‚Äôre still working in design-tool[.]com, its code could (maliciously or due to a compromise) send each clipboard read to a remote server ‚Äî without you ever pressing ‚Äúpaste.‚Äù
Unlike file downloads or microphone access, Chrome‚Äôs clipboard permission is ‚Äúall or nothing‚Äù for that site. Once allowed, the site can read at will until you manually revoke the permission.</p>

<p>What You Can Do
Grant Access Only When Needed:
Go to chrome://settings/content/clipboard and set permissions to ‚ÄúAsk before accessing.‚Äù
Revoke Access After Use:
Click the lock icon next to the address bar ‚Üí Site settings ‚Üí Block clipboard access. Use Separate Profiles:
Keep clipboard-trusted sites in a dedicated Chrome profile; close it when not in use. Avoid Copying Sensitive Data While a Site is Open:
If you must copy sensitive info, close the tab for any site with clipboard permissions first. Clipboard access is like giving a stranger a window into your desk ‚Äî you may only want them to look once, but if you leave the window open, they can keep peeking without asking.</p>

<p>Treat clipboard permissions as carefully as camera or microphone access. Conclusion
The pace isn‚Äôt slowing down, and the risks aren‚Äôt waiting. Every delay, every blind spot, becomes an opening someone else is ready to use. What‚Äôs urgent isn‚Äôt just patching or reacting‚Äîit‚Äôs staying one step ahead.</p>

<h2 id="malicious-pypi-and-npm-packages-discovered-exploiting-dependencies-in-supply-chain-attacks"><a id="article-10"></a>Malicious PyPI and npm Packages Discovered Exploiting Dependencies in Supply Chain Attacks</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a malicious package in the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository that introduces malicious behavior through a dependency that allows it to establish persistence and achieve code execution. The package, named
termncolor
, realizes its nefarious functionality through a dependency package called
colorinal
by means of a multi-stage malware operation, Zscaler ThreatLabz
said
. While termncolor was downloaded 355 times, colorinal attracted 529 downloads. Both libraries are no longer available on PyPI.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis attack could leverage DLL side-loading to facilitate decryption, establish persistence, and conduct command-and-control (C2) communication, ending in remote code execution,‚Äù according to researchers Manisha Ramcharan Prajapati and Satyam Singh. Once installed and executed, termncolor is designed to import colorinal, which, in turn, loads a rogue DLL that‚Äôs responsible for decrypting and running the next-stage payload. Specifically, the payload deploys a legitimate binary ‚Äúvcpktsvr.exe‚Äù and a DLL called ‚Äúlibcef.dll‚Äù that‚Äôs launched using DLL side-loading. The DLL, for its part, is capable of harvesting system information and communicating with the C2 server using
Zulip
, an open-source chat application, to conceal the activity.</p>

<p>‚ÄúPersistence is achieved by creating a registry entry under the Windows Run key to ensure automatic execution of the malware at system startup,‚Äù Zscaler said. The malware is also capable of infecting Linux systems, with the Python libraries dropping a shared object file called ‚Äúterminate.so‚Äù to unleash the same functionality. Further analysis of the threat actor‚Äôs Zulip activity has revealed three active users within the
created organization
, with a total of 90,692 messages exchanged within the platform. It‚Äôs believed that the malware author has been active since July 10, 2025.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe termncolor package and its malicious dependency colorinal highlight the importance of monitoring open-source ecosystems for potential supply chain attacks,‚Äù the company said. The disclosure comes as SlowMist
revealed
that threat actors are targeting developers under the guise of a job assessment to trick them into cloning a GitHub repository containing a booby-trapped npm package that‚Äôs capable of harvesting iCloud Keychain, web browser, and cryptocurrency wallet data, and exfiltrating the details to an external server. The npm packages are also engineered to download and run Python scripts, capture system information, scan the file system for sensitive files, steal credentials, log keystrokes, take screenshots, and monitor clipboard content. The list of identified packages, now removed from npm, is below -
redux-ace (163 Downloads)
rtk-logger (394 Downloads)
In recent months, malicious npm packages have been spotted targeting the cybersecurity community to facilitate data theft and cryptocurrency mining through a dependent package, using legitimate services like Dropbox to exfiltrate the information from infected systems.</p>

<p>These packages, Datadog researchers Christophe Tafani-Dereeper and Matt Muir
noted
, are distributed to targets under the guise of malicious proof-of-concept (PoC) code for security flaws, or a kernel patch that supposedly offers performance improvements. The activity has been attributed to a threat actor it tracks as
MUT-1244
. The development also follows a report from ReversingLabs that has revealed the risks associated with automated dependency upgrades, particularly when a compromised project is used by thousands of other projects, amplifying risks to the software supply chain. This is exemplified by the
recent compromise
of the eslint-config-prettier npm package by means of a phishing attack that allowed unnamed attackers to push poisoned versions directly to the npm registry without any source code commits or pull requests on its corresponding GitHub repository.</p>

<p>The software supply chain security company found that more than 14,000 packages have declared eslint-config-prettier as a direct dependency, instead of declaring it as a
devDependency
, causing automated actions like GitHub Actions to automatically merge the dependency update alerts issued by Dependabot without scrutinizing them. ‚ÄúSince this is a configuration for a development tool used for code formatting, it can be expected that it should be declared as a devDependency across packages in which it is used, and, as such, it shouldn‚Äôt be automatically installed when the npm install command is executed like with regular dependencies,‚Äù security researcher Karlo Zanki
said
. ‚ÄúAutomated version management tools like Dependabot are designed to remove the risk of having dependencies with security issues in your code base, but [‚Ä¶] ironically they can end up introducing even bigger security issues like malicious compromise.‚Äù

<h2 id="ermac-v30-banking-trojan-source-code-leak-exposes-full-malware-infrastructure"><a id="article-12"></a>ERMAC V3.0 Banking Trojan Source Code Leak Exposes Full Malware Infrastructure</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have detailed the inner workings of an Android banking trojan called ERMAC 3.0, uncovering serious shortcomings in the operators‚Äô infrastructure. ‚ÄúThe newly uncovered version 3.0 reveals a significant evolution of the malware, expanding its form injection and data theft capabilities to target more than 700 banking, shopping, and cryptocurrency applications,‚Äù Hunt.io
said
in a report. The latest iteration of the malware can send SMS or initiate phone calls to a phone number, set up call forwarding to a specified number, display custom push notification with, fetch Gmail email subject lines, take pictures using the front camera, launch overlays on top of financial apps, capture contact lists, SMS messages, installed apps, and remove itself from the device. ERMAC was
first documented
by ThreatFabric in September 2021, detailing its ability to conduct overlay attacks against hundreds of banking and cryptocurrency apps across the world.</p>

<p>Attributed to a threat actor named DukeEugene, it‚Äôs assessed to be an evolution of Cerberus and BlackRock. Other commonly
observed
malware families
‚Äì including Hook (ERMAC 2.0), Pegasus, and Loot ‚Äì possess a shared lineage: An ancestor in the form of ERMAC from which source code components have been passed down and modified through generations. Hunt.io said it managed to obtain the complete source code associated with the malware-as-a-service (MaaS) offering from an open directory on 141.164.62[.]236:443, right down to its PHP and Laravel backend, React-based frontend, Golang exfiltration server, and Android builder panel. The functions of each of the components are listed below -
Backend C2 server - Provides operators the ability to manage victim devices and access compromised data, such as SMS logs, stolen accounts, and device data
Frontend panel - Allows operators to interact with connected devices by issuing commands, managing overlays, and accessing stolen data
Exfiltration server - A Golang server used for exfiltrating stolen data and managing information related to compromised devices
ERMAC backdoor - An Android implant written in Kotlin that offers the ability to control the compromised device and collect sensitive data based on incoming commands from the C2 server, while ensuring that the infections don‚Äôt touch devices located in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) nations
ERMAC builder - A tool to help customers configure and create builds for their malware campaigns by providing the application name, server URL, and other settings for the Android backdoor
Besides an expanded set of app targets, ERMAC 3.0 adds new form injection methods, an overhauled command-and-control (C2) panel, a new Android backdoor, and AES-CBC encrypted communications.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe leak revealed critical weaknesses, such as a hardcoded JWT secret and a static admin bearer token, default root credentials, and open account registration on the admin panel,‚Äù the company said. ‚ÄúBy correlating these flaws with live ERMAC infrastructure, we provide defenders with concrete ways to track, detect, and disrupt active operations.‚Äù
