<h2 id="nvidia-triton-bugs-let-unauthenticated-attackers-execute-code-and-hijack-ai-servers"><a id="article-1"></a>NVIDIA Triton Bugs Let Unauthenticated Attackers Execute Code and Hijack AI Servers</h2>

<p>A newly disclosed set of security flaws in
NVIDIA‚Äôs Triton Inference Server
for Windows and Linux, an open-source platform for running artificial intelligence (AI) models at scale, could be exploited to take over susceptible servers. ‚ÄúWhen chained together, these flaws can potentially allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to gain complete control of the server, achieving remote code execution (RCE),‚Äù Wiz researchers Ronen Shustin and Nir Ohfeld
said
in a report published today. The
vulnerabilities
are listed below -
CVE-2025-23319
(CVSS score: 8.1) - A vulnerability in the Python backend, where an attacker could cause an out-of-bounds write by sending a request
CVE-2025-23320
(CVSS score: 7.5) - A vulnerability in the Python backend, where an attacker could cause the shared memory limit to be exceeded by sending a very large request
CVE-2025-23334
(CVSS score: 5.9) - A vulnerability in the Python backend, where an attacker could cause an out-of-bounds read by sending a request
Successful exploitation of the aforementioned vulnerabilities could result in information disclosure, as well as remote code execution, denial of service, data tampering in the case of CVE-2025-23319. The issues have been addressed in version 25.07.</p>

<p>The cloud security company said the three shortcomings could be combined together that transforms the problem from an information leak to a full system compromise without requiring any credentials. Specifically, the problems are rooted in the Python backend that‚Äôs designed to handle inference requests for Python models from any major AI frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. In the attack outlined by Wiz, a threat actor could exploit CVE-2025-23320 to leak the full, unique name of the backend‚Äôs internal IPC shared memory region, a key that should have remained private, and then leverage the remaining two flaws to gain full control of the inference server. ‚ÄúThis poses a critical risk to organizations using Triton for AI/ML, as a successful attack could lead to the theft of valuable AI models, exposure of sensitive data, manipulating the AI model‚Äôs responses, and a foothold for attackers to move deeper into a network,‚Äù the researchers said.</p>

<p>NVIDIA‚Äôs August bulletin for Triton Inference Server also highlights fixes for three critical bugs (CVE-2025-23310, CVE-2025-23311, and CVE-2025-23317) that, if successfully exploited, could result in remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, and data tampering. While there is no evidence that any of these vulnerabilities have been exploited in the wild, users are advised to apply the latest updates for optimal protection. Found this article interesting?

<h2 id="vietnamese-hackers-use-pxa-stealer-hit-4000-ips-and-steal-200000-passwords-globally"><a id="article-2"></a>Vietnamese Hackers Use PXA Stealer, Hit 4,000 IPs and Steal 200,000 Passwords Globally</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers are calling attention to a new wave of campaigns distributing a Python-based information stealer called PXA Stealer. The malicious activity has been assessed to be the work of Vietnamese-speaking cybercriminals who monetize the stolen data through a subscription-based underground ecosystem that automates the resale and reuse via Telegram APIs, according to a joint report published by Beazley Security and SentinelOne and shared with The Hacker News. ‚ÄúThis discovery showcases a leap in tradecraft, incorporating more nuanced anti-analysis techniques, non-malicious decoy content, and a hardened command-and-control pipeline that frustrates triage and attempts to delay detection,‚Äù security researchers Jim Walter, Alex Delamotte, Francisco Donoso, Sam Mayers, Tell Hause, and Bobby Venal
said
. The campaigns have infected over 4,000 unique IP addresses spanning 62 countries, including South Korea, the United States, the Netherlands, Hungary, and Austria.</p>

<p>Data captured via the stealer includes more than 200,000 unique passwords, hundreds of credit card records, and more than 4 million harvested browser cookies. PXA Stealer was
first documented
by Cisco Talos in November 2024, attributing it to attacks targeting government and education entities in Europe and Asia. It‚Äôs capable of harvesting passwords, browser autofill data, information from cryptocurrency wallets and financial institutions. Data stolen by the malware using Telegram as an exfiltration channel is fed into criminal platforms like Sherlock, a purveyor of stealer logs, from where downstream threat actors can purchase the information to engage in cryptocurrency theft or infiltrate organizations for follow-on purposes, fueling a cybercriminal ecosystem that runs at scale.</p>

<p>Campaigns distributing the malware in 2025 have witnessed a steady tactical evolution, with the threat actors employing DLL side-loading techniques and elaborate staging layers in an effort to fly under the radar. The malicious DLL takes care of conducting the rest of the steps in the infection sequence, ultimately paving the way for the deployment of the stealer, but not before taking steps to display a decoy document, such as a copyright infringement notice, to the victim. The stealer is an updated version boasting capabilities to extract cookies from Chromium-based web browsers by injecting a DLL into running instances with an aim to defeat
app-bound encryption safeguards
. It also plunders data from VPN clients, cloud command-line interface (CLI) utilities, connected fileshares, and applications like Discord.</p>

<p>‚ÄúPXA Stealer uses the BotIDs (stored as TOKEN_BOT) to establish the link between the main bot and the various ChatID (stored as CHAT_ID),‚Äù the researchers said. ‚ÄúThe ChatIDs are Telegram channels with various properties, but they primarily serve to host exfiltrated data and provide updates and notifications to the operators.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis threat has since matured into a highly evasive, multi-stage operation driven by Vietnamese-speaking actors with apparent ties to an organized cybercriminal Telegram-based marketplace that sells stolen victim data.‚Äù

<p>Malware isn‚Äôt just trying to hide anymore‚Äîit‚Äôs trying to belong. We‚Äôre seeing code that talks like us, logs like us, even documents itself like a helpful teammate. Some threats now look more like developer tools than exploits. Others borrow trust from open-source platforms, or quietly build themselves out of AI-written snippets.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not just about being malicious‚Äîit‚Äôs about being believable. In this week‚Äôs cybersecurity recap, we explore how today‚Äôs threats are becoming more social, more automated, and far too sophisticated for yesterday‚Äôs instincts to catch. ‚ö° Threat of the Week
Secret Blizzard Conduct ISP-Level AitM Attacks to Deploy ApolloShadow
‚Äî Russian cyberspies are abusing local internet service providers‚Äô networks to target foreign embassies in Moscow and likely collect intelligence from diplomats‚Äô devices. The activity has been attributed to the Russian advanced persistent threat (APT) known as Secret Blizzard (aka Turla).</p>

<p>It likely involves using an adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) position within domestic telecom companies and ISPs that diplomats are using for Internet access to push a piece of malware called ApolloShadow. This indicates that the ISP may be
working
with the threat actor to facilitate the attacks using the System for Operative Investigative activities (SORM) systems. Microsoft declined to say how many organizations were targeted, or successfully infected, in this campaign. Inside the 2025 Security Shift: What Every Cloud Leader Must Know Now

üîî Top News
Companies that Employed Hafnium Hackers Linked to Over a Dozen Patents
‚Äî Threat actors linked to the notorious Hafnium hacking group have worked for companies that registered several patents for highly intrusive forensics and data collection technologies. The findings highlight China‚Äôs diverse private sector offensive ecosystem and an underlying problem with mapping tradecraft to a specific cluster, which may not accurately reflect the true organizational structure of the attackers.</p>

<p>The fact that the threat actors have been attributed to three different companies shows that multiple companies may be working in tandem to conduct the intrusions and those companies may be providing their tools to other actors, leading to incomplete or misleading attribution. It‚Äôs currently not known how the threat actors came to possess the Microsoft Exchange Server flaws that were used to target various entities in a widespread campaign in early 2021. But their close relationship with the Shanghai State Security Bureau (SSSB) has raised the possibility that the bureau may have obtained access to information about the zero-days through some evidence collection method and passed it on to the attackers. The discovery also highlights another important aspect: China-based Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) may actually consist of different companies that serve many clients owing to the contracting ecosystem, which forces these companies to collaborate on intrusions.</p>

<p>In June 2025, Recorded Future
revealed
that a Chinese state-owned defense research institute filed a patent in late December 2024 that analyzes various kinds of intelligence, including OSINT, HUMINT, SIGINT, GEOINT, and TECHINT, to train a military-specific large language model in order to ‚Äúsupport every phase of the intelligence cycle and improve decision-making during military operations.‚Äù
Likely 0-Day SonicWall SSL VPN Flaw Used in Akira Ransomware Attacks
‚Äî SonicWall SSL VPN devices have become the target of Akira ransomware attacks as part of a newfound surge in activity observed in late July 2025. Arctic Wolf Labs said that the attacks could be exploiting an as-yet-undetermined security flaw in the appliances, meaning a zero-day vulnerability, given that some of the incidents affected fully-patched SonicWall devices. However, the possibility of credential-based attacks for initial access hasn‚Äôt been ruled out. The development came as watchTowr Labs detailed multiple vulnerabilities in SonicWall SMA 100 Series appliances (
CVE-2025-40596, CVE-2025-40597, and CVE-2025-40598
) that an attacker could exploit to cause denial-of-service or code execution.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe stumbled across vulnerabilities that feel like they were preserved in amber from a more na√Øve era of C programming,‚Äù security researcher Sina Kheirkhah
said
. ‚ÄúWhile we understand (and agree) that these vulnerabilities are ultimately difficult - or in some cases, currently not exploitable ‚Äì the fact that they exist at all is, frankly, disappointing. Pre-auth stack and heap overflows triggered by malformed HTTP headers aren‚Äôt supposed to happen anymore.‚Äù
UNC2891 Breaches ATM Network via 4G Raspberry Pi in Cyber-Physical Attack
‚Äî The threat actor known as UNC2891 has been observed targeting Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) infrastructure using a 4G-equipped Raspberry Pi as part of a covert attack. The cyber-physical attack involved the adversary leveraging their physical access to install the Raspberry Pi device and have it connected directly to the same network switch as the ATM, effectively placing it within the target bank‚Äôs network.</p>

<p>The end goal of the infection was to deploy the CAKETAP rootkit on the ATM switching server and facilitate fraudulent ATM cash withdrawals. UNC2891 is assessed to share tactical overlaps with another threat actor called UNC1945 (aka LightBasin), which was previously identified compromising managed service providers and striking targets within the financial and professional consulting industries. UNC1945 is also known for its attacks aimed at the telecom sector. Active Exploitation of Alone WordPress Theme Flaw
‚Äî Threat actors are actively exploiting a critical security flaw in ‚ÄúAlone ‚Äì Charity Multipurpose Non-profit WordPress Theme‚Äù to take over susceptible sites.</p>

<p>The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-5394 (CVSS score: 9.8), is an arbitrary file upload affecting all versions of the plugin prior to and including 7.8.3. It has been fixed in version 7.8.5 released on June 16, 2025. In the observed attacks, the flaw is averaged to upload a ZIP archive containing a PHP-based backdoor to execute remote commands and upload additional files. Alternatively, the flaw has also been weaponized to deliver fully-featured file managers and backdoors capable of creating rogue administrator accounts.</p>

<p>Multiple Flaws Patched in AI Code Editor Cursor
‚Äî Several security vulnerabilities have been addressed in Cursor, including one high-severity bug (CVE-2025-54135 aka CurXecute) that could result in remote code execution (RCE) when processing external content from a third-party model context protocol (MCP) server. ‚ÄúIf chained with a separate prompt injection vulnerability, this could allow the writing of sensitive MCP files on the host by the agent,‚Äù Cursor
said
. ‚ÄúThis can then be used to directly execute code by adding it as a new MCP server.‚Äù Also addressed in Cursor version 1.3 is CVE-2025-54136 (CVSS score of 7.2), which could have allowed attackers to swap harmless MCP configuration files for a malicious command, without triggering a warning. ‚ÄúIf an attacker has write permissions on a user‚Äôs active branches of a source repository that contains existing MCP servers the user has previously approved, or an attacker has arbitrary file-write locally, the attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution,‚Äù the company
said

Critical RCE in @nestjs/devtools-integration
‚Äî A critical remote code execution flaw (CVE-2025-54782, CVSS score: 9.4) has been uncovered in @nestjs/devtools-integration, a NestJS npm package downloaded over 56,000 times per week. The package sets up a local development server with an endpoint that executes arbitrary code inside a JavaScript ‚Äúsandbox‚Äù built with node:vm module and the now-abandoned safe-eval, ultimately allowing for execution of untrusted user code in a sandboxed environment, Socket
said
. Further analysis has found that the sandbox is trivially escapable and because the server is
accessible on localhost
, any malicious website can trigger code execution on a developer‚Äôs machine via CSRF using the inspector/graph/interact endpoint.</p>

<p>‚ÄúDue to improper sandboxing and missing cross-origin protections, any malicious website visited by a developer can execute arbitrary code on their local machine,‚Äù Nestjs maintainer Kamil Mysliwiec
said
in an advisory. ‚ÄúBy chaining these issues, a malicious website can trigger the vulnerable endpoint and achieve arbitrary code execution on a developer‚Äôs machine running the NestJS devtools integration.‚Äù
Attackers Exploit Compromised Email Accounts for Attacks
‚Äî Threat actors are increasingly using compromised internal or trusted business partner email accounts to send malicious emails to obtain initial access. ‚ÄúUsing a legitimate trusted account affords an attacker numerous advantages, such as potentially bypassing an organization‚Äôs security controls as well as appearing more trustworthy to the recipient,‚Äù Talos
said
. The disclosure comes as bad actors are also
continuing to exploit
Microsoft 365‚Äôs Direct Send feature to deliver phishing emails that appear to originate from within the organization by using a spoofed internal From address and increases the likelihood of success of social engineering attacks.</p>

<p>The messages are injected into Microsoft 365 tenants via unsecured third-party email security appliances used as SMTP relays. ‚ÄúThis tactic allows attackers to send malicious payloads to Microsoft 365 users with increased credibility, often resulting in successful delivery despite failed authentication checks,‚Äù Proofpoint
said
. Signal Warns it Will Exit Australia Over Encryption Backdoor Push
‚Äî Signal Foundation president Meredith Whittaker
said
the secure messaging application will leave Australia if the government forces it to incorporate a backdoor into its encryption algorithm or demand access to encrypted user data. Earlier this year, the U.K.</p>

<p>government issued a secret order demanding that Apple allow it access to encrypted user data to assist in investigations, resulting in Apple
removing
its Advanced Data Protection (ADP) feature for users in the region. While the U.K. government
appears to be backing down
from its earlier demand, Google
told
TechCrunch that, unlike Apple, it did not receive any request from the U.K. to build a secret backdoor.</p>

<p>This is the first time Google has formally commented on the matter. Google Hardens Chrome Extension Supply Chain Against Account Compromise
‚Äî Google has rolled out a new security feature called Verified CRX Upload for Chrome extension developers that enforces cryptographic signatures for all Chrome extension updates and prevents bad actors from compromising developer accounts and publishing malicious updates to the Chrome Web Store (CWS). The security protection is also designed to address scenarios where CWS code reviews may not always flag such malicious attacks. ‚ÄúWhen opting an extension into Verified CRX Upload, the developer gives Google a public key.</p>

<p>After that, the developer can no longer upload unsigned ZIP files for that extension and must instead upload a CRX file signed with the corresponding private key,‚Äù Google
said
[PDF]. ‚ÄúVerified upload acts as a second factor for the act of uploading to CWS. A malicious actor who compromises a developer‚Äôs account password, session cookies, or even an OAuth token, would not be able to upload a malicious update unless they also gain access to the developer‚Äôs private signing key.‚Äù
Kimsuky Targets South Korea with Stealer Malware
‚Äî The North Korea-linked
Kimsuky
hacking group has been linked to a spear-phishing campaign that targets South Korean entities using Windows shortcut (LNK) files as an initial access vector to trigger a multi-stage infection chain to deploy a keylogger, information stealer, establish persistent control over compromised hosts, and deliver unknown next-stage payloads. In parallel, users are displayed with lure PDF documents related to tax notices and government alerts about alleged sex offenders in the area.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOnce inside, the malware performs extensive system profiling, steals credentials and sensitive documents, monitors user activity through keylogging and clipboard capture, and exfiltrates data in discreet segments over standard web traffic‚Äîhelping it blend into normal network operations,‚Äù Aryaka
said
. Apple macOS Flaw Can Bypass TCC
‚Äî Attackers could have used a recently patched macOS vulnerability to bypass Transparency, Consent, and Control (
TCC
) security checks and steal sensitive user information from locations such as the Downloads directory and Apple Intelligence caches. The flaw, dubbed
Sploitlight
by Microsoft and tracked as CVE-2025-31199, was addressed by Apple with the release of macOS Sequoia 15.4 in March 2025. The attack is so named because it exploits Spotlight plugins called importers, which are used to index data found on a device and surface it via its built-in search tool.</p>

<p>Sploitlight turns these plugins into a TCC bypass, allowing valuable data to be leaked without a user‚Äôs consent. Improved Version of XWorm Spotted
‚Äî A new version of a remote access trojan called
XWorm
(version 6.0) has been
discovered
with new features such as process protection and enhanced anti-analysis capabilities, indicating continued attempts by the developers to iterate and refine their tactics. The starting point of the attack is a Visual Basic Script that‚Äôs likely delivered to targets via social engineering, which then proceeds to set up persistence on the host via Windows Registry (as opposed to scheduled tasks in the previous version), although it‚Äôs important to note that the builder offers three different methods, including the aforementioned techniques and the adding the payload to the Startup folder. It‚Äôs also designed to run a PowerShell script that includes the ability to bypass Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) via in-memory modification of ‚Äúclr.dll‚Äù to sidestep detection.</p>

<p>Some of the new features observed in the latest version of XWorm are its ability to prevent process termination by marking itself as a critical process and killing itself if the compromised host is running Windows XP. Mozilla Warns Add-ons Devs Against Phishing Attack
‚Äî Browser maker Mozilla is
warning
of a phishing campaign targeting its Firefox Add-ons infrastructure that aims to trick developers into parting with their account credentials as part of emails containing messages like ‚ÄúYour Mozilla Add-ons account requires an update to continue accessing developer features‚Äù that are designed to provoke engagement. The disclosure follows the
emergence
of bogus Firefox add-ons that masquerade as TronLink, Solflare, Rabby Wallet and are
designed to steal cryptocurrency wallet secrets
, security researcher Lukasz Olejnik said. New Stealer Malware Dissected
‚Äî Cybersecurity researchers have detailed three new stealer malware families called
Cyber Stealer
,
Raven Stealer
, and
SHUYAL Stealer
that combine extensive credential theft capabilities with advanced system reconnaissance and evasion tactics.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBeyond credential theft, SHUYAL captures system screenshots and clipboard content, exfiltrating this data alongside stolen Discord tokens through a Telegram bot infrastructure,‚Äù Hybrid Analysis said. ‚ÄúThe malware maintains operational stealth through self-deletion mechanisms, removing traces of its activity using a batch file after completing its primary functions.‚Äù Cyber Stealer, for its part, maintains communication with its command-and-control (C2) server through heartbeat checks, XMR miner configuration, task checks, and data exfiltration. It also comes with a clipper, remote shell, reverse proxy, DDoS, XMR mining, and DNS poisoning capabilities based on the subscription tier chosen by a customer. ‚ÄúThe C2 URL can be dynamically updated through Pastebin, with a hardcoded backup URL if that fails,‚Äù eSentire said.</p>

<p>While there are a number of stealers on the cybercrime scene already, the emergence of new stealers demonstrates the lucrative nature of such tools to enable data theft at scale. The third new infostealer malware is Raven Stealer, which is actively distributed through GitHub repositories and promoted via a Telegram channel operated by the threat actors. The stealer is consistent with other stealers, facilitating credential theft, browser data harvesting, and real-time data exfiltration via Telegram bot integration. NOVABLIGHT Node.js Stealer Spotted in the Wild
‚Äî Developed and sold by the Sordeal Group, a threat actor demonstrating French-language proficiency, NOVABLIGHT is marketed as an ‚Äúeducational tool‚Äù on platforms like Telegram and Discord from ‚Ç¨25 for a month to ‚Ç¨140 for six months ($28 to $162).</p>

<p>However, this aspect masks its true intent: A modular, feature-rich NodeJS-based malware built on the Electron framework, designed to steal sensitive information, including login credentials and cryptocurrency wallet data. The malware is said to be distributed via fake websites advertising video game installers. ‚ÄúNOVABLIGHT is a modular and feature-rich information stealer built on Node.js with the Electron framework,‚Äù Elastic Security Labs
said
. ‚ÄúIts capabilities go beyond simple credential theft, incorporating methods for data collection and exfiltration, sandbox detection, and heavy obfuscation.‚Äù
$3.5B LuBian Bitcoin Theft Goes Undetected for Nearly Five Years
‚Äî A previously undisclosed theft of
127,426 Bitcoin
, valued at $3.5 billion at the time (presently approximately $14.5 billion), has been traced back to a December 2020 attack on a little-known Chinese mining pool called LuBian, making it as the largest cryptocurrency theft to date, surpassing the
$1.5 billion Bybit hack
that occurred in February 2025.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThey appear to have been first hacked on December 28th, 2020, for over 90% of their BTC,‚Äù Arkham Intelligence
said
. ‚ÄúSubsequently, on December 29th, around $6M of additional BTC and USDT was stolen from a Lubian address active on the Bitcoin Omni layer. On the 31st, LuBian rotated their remaining funds to recovery wallets.‚Äù It‚Äôs believed that the unknown attackers may have exploited a flawed private key generation algorithm that left it susceptible to brute-force attacks. ‚ÄúLuBian preserved 11,886 BTC, currently worth $1.35B, which they still hold,‚Äù Arkham said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe hacker also still holds the stolen BTC, with their last known movement being a wallet consolidation in July 2024.‚Äù Neither LuBian nor the suspected hacker has ever publicly acknowledged the breach. Russia Blocks Access to Speedtest
‚Äî Russia
blocked
access to Speedtest, a popular internet speed testing tool developed by U.S. company Ookla, claiming the service poses a national security threat and could aid cyber attacks. The restriction is due to the ‚Äúidentified threats to the security of the public communication network and the Russian segment of the internet,‚Äù Roskomnadzor, country‚Äôs communications watchdog,
said
, adding it ‚Äúcollects data on the layout and capacity of Russian communications nodes‚Äù that could be used to ‚Äúplan, conduct, and assess attacks on Russian networks and related systems.‚Äù
CISA Releases Thorium
‚Äî The U.S.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
announced
the public availability of
Thorium
, an open-source platform for malware and forensic analysts across the government, public, and private sectors. ‚ÄúThorium enhances cybersecurity teams‚Äô capabilities by automating analysis workflows through seamless integration of commercial, open-source, and custom tools,‚Äù CISA said. ‚ÄúIt supports various mission functions, including software analysis, digital forensics, and incident response, allowing analysts to efficiently assess complex malware threats.‚Äù The agency has also
released
the Eviction Strategies Tool, which helps security teams during the incident response by providing the necessary actions to contain and evict adversaries from compromised networks and devices. Russian Entities Targeted to Deploy Cobalt Strike
‚Äî The Russian information technology (IT) sector, and to a certain extent companies in China, Japan, Malaysia, and Peru, has been at the receiving end of a spear-phishing email campaign that
delivers
the Cobalt Strike Beacon by means of intermediate payloads that reach out to fake profiles on social media platforms to obtain the URL hosting the post-exploitation toolkit.</p>

<p>The accounts, created on GitHub, Quora, and Russian-language social networks, are said to have been created specifically for the attacks and act as
dead drop resolvers
to facilitate operational resiliency. The activity was first recorded in the second half of 2024, reaching its peak in November and December. The campaign has not been attributed to any known threat actor or group. APT36 Targets Indian Railways, Oil &amp; Gas Sectors
‚Äî A suspected Pakistani threat actor known as APT36 (aka Transparent Tribe) has been attributed to attacks targeting Indian railway systems, oil and gas infrastructure, and the Ministry of External Affairs via spear-phishing attacks to deliver a known malware called
Poseidon
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThey use .desktop files disguised as PDF documents to execute scripts that download malware and establish persistence using cron jobs,‚Äù Hunt.io
said
. ‚ÄúThe Poseidon backdoor, built on the Mythic framework and written in Go, is used to maintain access and support lateral movement.‚Äù
Qilin Ransomware Attack Leverages BYOVD Technique
‚Äî Threat actors associated with
Qilin
ransomware have been observed leveraging a previously unknown driver, TPwSav.sys, to stealthily disable security tools using a custom version of EDRSandblast as part of a Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) attack. ‚ÄúThis driver, originally developed for power-saving features on Toshiba laptops, is a signed Windows kernel driver, making it an attractive choice for bypassing EDR protections through a BYOVD attack,‚Äù Blackpoint Cyber
said
. Prior to this incident, there has been no evidence of in-the-wild exploitation of the driver.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCompiled in 2015 and holding a valid signature, this driver is an appealing candidate for BYOVD attacks aimed at disabling EDR. While interacting with the driver requires only low-level privileges, loading it and enumerating physical memory demand administrative privileges,‚Äù the company added. Phishing Campaign Distributes 0bj3ctivity Stealer
‚Äî Phishing emails bearing purchase order-lures are being used to distribute via JavaScript files a
stealer
called
0bj3ctivity Stealer
, which has been propagated via Ande Loader in the past. ‚ÄúThe further stages are uncommon, including custom PowerShell scripts to deploy the next stages and steganography to hide some of the payloads,‚Äù Trellix
said
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOnce decoded, the PowerShell script will download from archive.org a JPG image, which contains the next stage hidden using steganography.‚Äù The United States, Germany, and Montenegro exhibit a high volume of detections, although telemetry data has also revealed noticeable activity in Europe, North America, Southeast Asia, and Australia, indicating the global nature of the threat. Increasing Number of Flaws Leveraged as 0- or 1-Days
‚Äî A third of flaws leveraged by attackers this year have been zero-day or 1-day flaws, indicating that threat actors are becoming faster at exploiting vulnerabilities. ‚ÄúWe observed an 8.5% increase in the percentage of KEVs [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities] that had exploitation evidence disclosed on or before the day a CVE was published ‚Äî 32.1% in H1-2025 as compared to the 23.6% we reported in 2024,‚Äù VulnCheck
said
. In total, the company added 432 new vulnerabilities to its KEV list in the first half of 2025, with 92 unique threat actors linked to the exploitation efforts.</p>

<p>Of these, 56 (60.8%) were attributed to specific countries, including China (20), Russia (11), North Korea (9), and Iran (6). In a related development, a GreyNoise report
found
that in 80% of reconnaissance spikes against enterprise gear, the increase in activity was followed by the publication of a new CVE within six weeks, suggesting threat actors or researchers are testing their exploits ahead of time. ‚ÄúThese patterns were exclusive to enterprise edge technologies like VPNs, firewalls, and remote access tools ‚Äì the same kinds of systems increasingly targeted by advanced threat actors,‚Äù the threat intelligence firm said. BreachForums Comes Back Online
‚Äî BreachForums
appears to be back again
after it went offline in April.</p>

<p>The popular cybercrime forum was
shut down
and
resurrected
several times over the past year. According to DataBreaches.Net, the official site appears to be back online on its dark web address, while preserving the original user database, reputation, credits, and posts. What‚Äôs more, the site seems to have returned under new leadership ‚Äì a user with the online moniker ‚ÄúN/A.‚Äù In an introductory post, N/A also claimed that none of its administrators have been arrested and that it‚Äôs ‚Äúbusiness as usual.‚Äù
RedCurl‚Äôs New Attacks Deliver RedLoader
‚Äî The threat actor known as
Gold Blade
(aka Earth Kapre, RedCurl, and Red Wolf) has been
linked to a new set of attacks
in July 2025 that combine malicious LNK files and WebDAV to execute remotely hosted DLLs to ultimately launch RedLoader using DLL side-loading. The LNK files, disguised as cover letters in the PDF format, are distributed via phishing emails via third-party job search sites like Indeed.</p>

<p>Mimo Exploits SharePoint Flaws to Deliver Ransomware
‚Äî The threat actor known as
Mimo
is
exploiting
the recently disclosed Microsoft SharePoint flaws to deliver the Go-based 4L4MD4r ransomware. The hacking group was
recently linked
to the abuse of a critical Craft CMS flaw to drop miners. The development marks the first time the hacking group has deployed ransomware in the wild. Silver Fox APT Uses Fake Flash Plugin to Deliver Malware
‚Äî The threat actor tracked as Silver Fox has been observed delivering the
Winos
trojan under the guise of popular tools like Adobe Flash, Google Translate, and WPS.</p>

<p>Typical distribution vectors include email,
phishing websites
, and instant messaging software. ‚ÄúHowever, with the leakage of core remote control Trojan source code (such as Winos 4.0) in the cybercrime circle, Silver Fox has gradually transformed from a single organization into a malicious family widely redeveloped by cybercrime groups and even APT organizations,‚Äù the Knownsec 404 team
said
. ‚ÄúWinos has a rich set of functional plug-ins that enable various remote control functions and data theft on the target host.‚Äù
Girona Hacker Arrested
‚Äî Spanish authorities have
apprehended
a cybercriminal who allegedly stole sensitive data from major financial institutions, educational organizations, and private companies across the country. The accused, described as a man with advanced computer programming skills, stands accused of targeting Spanish banks, a driving school, and a public university, among others.</p>

<p>The suspect is alleged to have stolen personal databases of employees and customers, as well as internal documents of companies and organizations, and then sold them for profit. ShadowSyndicate Infrastructure Analyzed
‚Äî Cybersecurity researchers have found connections between
ShadowSyndicate
infrastructure and various malware families like AMOS Stealer, TrueBot, and a number of ransomware strains such as Cl0p, BlackCat, LockBit, Play, Royal, CACTUS, and RansomHub. Aside from having access to a network of bulletproof hosters (BPHs) in Europe, it‚Äôs believed that ShadowSyndicate functions as an initial access broker (IAB) fueling Russian, North Korean, and Chinese APTs. ‚ÄúIt remains unclear whether ShadowSyndicate has a structured business model with formal clients or partners in cybercrime, or whether it represents a more fluid, hybrid threat actor,‚Äù Intrinsec
said
.</p>

<p>Who is Lionishackers? ‚Äî Threat hunters have ripped the cover off Lionishackers, a corporate database seller and a financially motivated threat actor focused on exfiltrating and selling corporate databases through Telegram and underground forums since July 2024. ‚ÄúEven though they seem to have an opportunistic approach when choosing their targets, there seems to be a certain preference for victims located in Asian countries,‚Äù Outpost24
said
. ‚ÄúThey have shown a high level of collaboration with the ‚ÄòHunt3r Kill3rs‚Äô group and extensive participation in relevant underground communities‚Äô Telegram channels.</p>

<p>Furthermore, they also worked on and offered other services such as pen testing, the commercialization of the Ghost botnet, and the launch of a forum project dubbed Stressed Forums.‚Äù
EdskManager RAT, Pulsar RAT, and Retro-C2 RAT Exposed
‚Äî Three new remote access trojans called EdskManager RAT, Pulsar RAT, and Retro-C2 RAT have been flagged by cybersecurity researchers, flagging their ability to evade detection and maintain control over compromised systems. ‚ÄúThe malware employs a downloader disguised as legitimate software, followed by in-memory decryption and stealth communication with command-and-control servers,‚Äù CYFIRMA
said
about EdskManager RAT. ‚ÄúIts use of HVNC (Hidden Virtual Network Computing), advanced persistence techniques, and anti-analysis measures indicates a strong focus on long-term, covert access to infected systems.‚Äù
Pulsar RAT
, on the other hand, is an Android trojan that exploits
accessibility services
to gain near-total control of the device, accessing messages, calls, GPS data, the camera, microphone, and other sensitive data. Developed by a Turkish-speaking threat actor known as ZeroTrace, Retro-C2 RAT employs reflective loading techniques to evade detection and siphon data from compromised machines.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe command-and-control infrastructure is fully web-based and provides threat actors with real-time client monitoring, action management such as CMD, PowerShell, Remote Desktop, keylogging, clipboard capture, file and process management, registry and network operations, audio recording, wallet scanning, persistence operations, and credential recovery,‚Äù ThreatMon
said
. Apple to Enable Advanced Fingerprinting Protection for All Safari Browsing Sessions
‚Äî Apple has
revealed
that it intends to make advanced fingerprinting protection the default for all browsing sessions in Safari with the release of iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26 in September 2025. Currently, the option is limited to Private Browsing mode. The feature was
first introduced
in Safari 17.0.</p>

<p>Security Flaw Uncovered in Catwatchful Spyware
‚Äî An SQL injection vulnerability in an Android stalkerware operation called
Catwatchful
has
exposed
more than 62,000 of its customers, including its Uruguay-based administrator, Omar Soca Charcov. The bug, discovered by researcher Eric Daigle, could be exploited to leak the application‚Äôs database, compromising customers‚Äô email addresses and plaintext passwords. Google has since
added protections
to flag such malicious apps and
suspended the developer‚Äôs Firebase account
for abusing its infrastructure to operate the monitoring software. Ransomware Continues to be a Threat
‚Äî DragonForce has claimed more than 250 victims on its dark web leak site, with 58 in the second quarter of 2025 alone, indicating that the ransomware cartel is gaining traction after purportedly absorbing RansomHub.</p>

<p>Some of the groups that appear to have exited the scene include RansomHub, Babuk-Bjorka, FunkSec, BianLian, 8Base, Cactus, and Hunters International. ‚ÄúWith major RaaS services shutting down, many affiliates are operating independently or seeking new partnerships,‚Äù Check Point
said
. ‚ÄúThe result is a growing number of smaller, often short-lived, ransomware entities. At the same time, established players are actively competing to recruit these ‚Äòorphaned‚Äô affiliates.‚Äù Ransomware attacks have also been observed evolving beyond double extortion to coerce victims into paying up with threats of data leaks and DDoS attacks.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>‚ÄúDouble, triple, and quadruple extortion tactics add pressure by threatening to expose customer information, disrupting operations with distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and sending harassing messages to business partners, customers, and others ‚Äì including informing media of the breach,‚Äù Akamai</dt>
  <dt>said</dt>
  <dt>. Threat Actors Hide Malware in DNS Records</dt>
  <dt>‚Äî While it‚Äôs known that threat actors have leveraged the Domain Name System (DNS) for command-and-control purposes using a technique called</dt>
  <dt>DNS tunneling</dt>
  <dt>, it has been observed that cybercriminals are</dt>
  <dt>evolving their tactics</dt>
  <dt>further by</dt>
  <dt>concealing malicious commands in DNS TXT records</dt>
  <dt>by converting them into their hexadecimal representation and storing them in chunks. The practice is both clever and sneaky as it allows malicious scripts and early-stage malware to fetch binary files without having to download them from attacker-controlled sites or attach them to emails, which have a higher chance of being detected by antivirus software. üé• Cybersecurity Webinars</dt>

Your Keyboard Could Be Spying on You ‚Äî Here‚Äôs How to Tell ‚Äî
Most people don‚Äôt realize it, but your smartphone keyboard can do more than just type.</p>

<p>Some of them quietly connect to the internet, sending back what you type, when you type, and even what‚Äôs in your clipboard. Even trusted apps like Gboard and SwiftKey have cloud sync features that share your typing patterns. And in worse cases, rogue keyboards can log passwords or steal crypto wallet seeds without any visible signs. The fix isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúdon‚Äôt use shady keyboards.‚Äù It‚Äôs knowing how to control what they can do.</p>

<p>Start by using a firewall app like NetGuard or RethinkDNS to block your keyboard from sending data over the internet. Go into your keyboard‚Äôs settings and turn off ‚Äúpersonalization‚Äù or sync features. Watch out for weird behavior like a keyboard asking for access to your mic, contacts, or location ‚Äî those are red flags. On newer Android versions, clipboard alerts will warn you if a keyboard is snooping.</p>

<p>If you want full peace of mind, switch to a keyboard that respects your privacy by design. Options like OpenBoard or Simple Keyboard have no internet access at all. They‚Äôre fast, clean, and open source ‚Äî meaning their code can be audited for hidden behavior. In short: if your keyboard wants to ‚Äúlearn from you,‚Äù make sure it‚Äôs not learning too much.</p>

<p>Conclusion
Every threat we covered this week tells the same story: attackers are evolving faster because they‚Äôre learning from us. From how we code to how we trust, they‚Äôre watching closely. But the flipside? So are we.</p>

<h2 id="man-in-the-middle-attack-prevention-guide"><a id="article-5"></a>Man-in-the-Middle Attack Prevention Guide</h2>

<p>Some of the most devastating cyberattacks don‚Äôt rely on brute force, but instead succeed through stealth. These quiet intrusions often go unnoticed until long after the attacker has disappeared. Among the most insidious are man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where criminals exploit weaknesses in communication protocols to silently position themselves between two unsuspecting parties
Fortunately, protecting your communications from MITM attacks doesn‚Äôt require complex measures. By taking a few simple steps, your security team can go a long way in securing users‚Äô data and keeping silent attackers at bay.</p>

<p>Know your enemy
In a
MITM attack
, a malicious actor intercepts communications between two parties (such as a user and a web app) to steal sensitive information. By secretly positioning themselves between the two ends of the conversation, MITM attackers can capture data like credit card numbers,
login credentials
, and account details. This stolen information often fuels further crimes, including unauthorized purchases, financial account takeovers, and identity theft. The widespread use of MITM attacks speaks to their effectiveness, with several high-profile incidents making headlines and showcasing just how damaging these attacks can be.</p>

<p>Notable examples include the
Equifax data breach
, the
Lenovo Superfish
scandal, and the
DigiNotar
compromise ‚Äì all of which highlight how devastating MitM attacks can be when security controls fail. Common MITM threat vectors
MITM attacks are especially common in environments with unsecured Wi-Fi and a high volume of potential victims (e.g., coffee shops, hotels, or airports). Cybercriminals will look to exploit misconfigured or unsecured networks or deploy rogue hardware that mimics legitimate access points. Once the rogue access point is active, the attacker spoofs the Wi-Fi name (i.e., service set identifier or SSID) to closely resemble a trusted network.</p>

<p>Unsuspecting users, whose devices automatically connect to familiar or strong-signal networks, often join without realizing they‚Äôre on a malicious connection. The role of spoofing in MITM attacks
Spoofing is what allows attackers to disguise themselves as a trusted entity within the environment. This deception enables them to intercept, monitor, or manipulate the data being exchanged without raising suspicion. mDNS and DNS spoofing
mDNS and DNS spoofing are common tactics that trick devices into trusting malicious sources.</p>

<p>Attackers exploit mDNS on local networks by replying to name requests with fake addresses, while DNS spoofing injects false data to redirect users to harmful websites, where sensitive information can be stolen. ARP spoofing
Hackers may intercept local network traffic by exploiting the address resolution protocol (ARP). By replying to a device‚Äôs request for a MAC address with their own, attackers redirect data meant for another device to themselves. This lets them capture and analyze private communications, potentially stealing sensitive information like session tokens and gaining unauthorized access to accounts.</p>

<p>Protecting against MITM attacks
Despite seeming complicated, MITM attacks can be effectively thwarted with the following set of best practices. Encrypt everything
To prevent your data from being intercepted or tampered with, enforce HTTPS and TLS across all web traffic. Use HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to ensure browsers connect only over secure channels, and apply secure cookie flags to protect sensitive information from exposure on unencrypted connections. For mobile and desktop apps, implement certificate pinning to bind apps to specific server certificates ‚Äì this makes it harder for attackers to impersonate trusted services and intercept communications.</p>

<p>Secure your network
Avoid public Wi-Fi when possible, or use a trusted VPN to
encrypt
your traffic and shield it from eavesdroppers. Within your network, segmenting internal systems and isolating untrusted zones helps contain breaches and restrict attackers‚Äô lateral movement. Additionally, deploying DNSSEC cryptographically validates DNS responses, while DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over TLS (DoT) make it harder for attackers to tamper with or spoof domain resolutions by encrypting DNS queries. Authenticate and validate
Implement mutual TLS to require both clients and servers to authenticate each other before connecting, blocking impersonation and interception.</p>

<p>Enforcing
strong multi-factor authentication (MFA)
on critical services adds another layer of protection, making it harder for attackers to exploit stolen credentials. Regularly auditing and rotating TLS certificates and encryption keys is also vital to close security gaps caused by compromised or outdated cryptographic materials. Endpoint and traffic monitoring
To mitigate MITM attacks, security teams should implement a layered defense strategy. Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) can be configured to flag unusual SSL/TLS handshake patterns.</p>

<p>External attack surface management (EASM)
tools are crucial for uncovering vulnerabilities and expired or misconfigured certificates on unknown or unmanaged internet-facing assets. Continuous monitoring for certificate mismatches or unexpected certificate authorities can expose spoofed services and fraudulent intermediaries. Also, advanced endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions can detect common MITM tactics such as ARP spoofing and rogue proxy use, enabling faster investigation and remediation. Educate users
Educating users to heed invalid certificate warnings helps them avoid connecting to malicious or spoofed servers.</p>

<p>At the same time, developers must follow secure-by-default coding practices that never disable certificate validation, as skipping these checks creates critical vulnerabilities. Incorporating both static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST) into the development cycle ensures issues like weak encryption or improper certificate handling are detected and fixed early. Strengthen your Active Directory security today
By focusing on strong, unique passphrases; actively scanning AD for breached credentials; and enforcing MFA everywhere it matters, you eliminate the easiest avenue for attackers to exploit intercepted data. Specops Password Policy
augments Active Directory‚Äôs native password mechanisms by embedding a real-time check against both global breached-password feeds and any custom ban‚Äêlists you configure.</p>

<p>Because it hooks directly into your domain controllers via a lightweight password filter, it intercepts and blocks risky passwords at the moment of creation ‚Äì stopping attackers from leveraging exposed credentials. With granular OU-based policy objects, centralized reporting dashboards, and integration points for MFA and
Self Service Password Resets (SSPR)
, it provides a comprehensive, low-overhead way to ensure that nobody in your organization is reusing or choosing weak or breached passwords. Reach out for a live demo

<h2 id="new-plague-pam-backdoor-exposes-critical-linux-systems-to-silent-credential-theft"><a id="article-6"></a>New ‚ÄòPlague‚Äô PAM Backdoor Exposes Critical Linux Systems to Silent Credential Theft</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have flagged a previously undocumented Linux backdoor dubbed
Plague
that has managed to evade detection for a year. ‚ÄúThe implant is built as a malicious
PAM
(Pluggable Authentication Module), enabling attackers to silently bypass system authentication and gain persistent SSH access,‚Äù Nextron Systems researcher Pierre-Henri Pezier
said
. Pluggable Authentication Modules refers to a suite of shared libraries used to manage user authentication to applications and services in Linux and UNIX-based systems. Given that PAM modules are loaded into privileged authentication processes, a rogue PAM can
enable
theft of user credentials, bypass authentication checks, and remain undetected by security tools.</p>

<p>The cybersecurity company said it uncovered multiple Plague artifacts uploaded to VirusTotal since July 29, 2024, with none of them detected by antimalware engines as malicious. What‚Äôs more, the presence of several samples signals active development of the malware by the unknown threat actors behind it. Plague boasts of four prominent features: Static credentials to allow covert access, resist analysis and reverse engineering using anti-debugging and string obfuscation; and enhanced stealth by erasing evidence of an SSH session. This, in turn, is accomplished by unsetting environment variables such as
SSH_CONNECTION and SSH_CLIENT
using unsetenv, and redirecting
HISTFILE
to /dev/null to prevent shell command logging, in order otherwise avoid leaving an audit trail.</p>

<p>‚ÄúPlague integrates deeply into the authentication stack, survives system updates, and leaves almost no forensic traces,‚Äù Pezier noted. ‚ÄúCombined with layered obfuscation and environment tampering, this makes it exceptionally hard to detect using traditional tools.‚Äù

<h2 id="the-wild-west-of-shadow-it"><a id="article-7"></a>The Wild West of Shadow IT</h2>

<p>Everyone‚Äôs an IT decision-maker now. The employees in your organization can install a plugin with just one click, and they don‚Äôt need to clear it with your team first. It‚Äôs great for productivity, but it‚Äôs a serious problem for your security posture. When the floodgates of SaaS and AI opened, IT didn‚Äôt just get democratized, its security got outpaced.</p>

<p>Employees are onboarding apps faster than security teams can say, ‚ÄúWe need to check this out first.‚Äù The result is a sprawling mess of shadow IT, embedded AI, and OAuth permissions that would make any CISO break into a cold sweat. Here are five ways IT democratization can undermine your organization‚Äôs security posture and how to prevent it from doing so. 1. You can‚Äôt secure what you can‚Äôt see
Remember when IT security used to control what was allowed to pass the firewall?</p>

<p>Good times. Today, anyone can find an app to do the heavy lifting for them. They won‚Äôt notice or care when the app requires access to your company‚Äôs Google Drive or has embedded AI. These apps are entering your stack right under your nose.</p>

<p>The process is fast, decentralized, and a security nightmare. How to solve it:
You need full visibility into the entire application stack, including any shadow IT or shadow AI in use. How can this be achieved? This comes down to one question: How good is your discovery?</p>

<p>Wing automatically discovers every app in use, whether its SaaS, internal app, if it has embedded AI or if it‚Äôs an AI agent, even the ones hiding behind personal logins, OAuth connections, and browser extensions. It surfaces the risk levels, flags redundant or suspicious tools, and gives you the power to review, restrict, or remove them. 2. The growing attack surface of Shadow AI
AI tools are tech‚Äôs new shiny object and your organization‚Äôs users are all in.</p>

<p>From copy to deck generators, code assistants, and data crunchers, most of them were never reviewed or approved. The productivity gains of AI are huge. Productivity has been catapulted forward in every department and across every vertical. So what could go wrong?</p>

<p>Oh, just sensitive data leaks, uncontrolled API connections, persistent OAuth tokens, and no monitoring, audit logs, or privacy policies‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs just to name a few of the very real and dangerous issues. How to solve it:
You need a discovery tool that detects where AI is being used and how, even when it‚Äôs embedded within applications. Wing continuously detects apps with embedded AI, AI agents and Agetic AI across your environment, not just the ones you‚Äôre aware of, but also the ones that snuck into your stack unnoticed. It even alerts you when an app in use suddenly adds AI capabilities, so you are aware of this and not caught by surprise.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Supply chain breaches: your weakest link
Modern SaaS stacks form an interconnected ecosystem. Applications integrate with each other through OAuth tokens, API keys, and third-party plug-ins to automate workflows and enable productivity. But every integration is a potential entry point ‚Äî and attackers know it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Compromising a lesser-known SaaS tool with broad integration permissions can serve as a stepping stone into more critical systems. Shadow integrations, unvetted AI tools, and abandoned apps connected via OAuth can create a fragmented, risky supply chain. Worse, many of these connections operate outside the security team‚Äôs visibility, especially when installed by end users without formal review or approval. This supply chain sprawl introduces hidden dependencies and expands your attack surface ‚Äî turning SaaS connectivity from a productivity driver into a threat vector.</p>

<p>How to solve it:
You need complete visibility into your app-to-app ecosystem. Wing Security maps every integration across your stack, showing not just which SaaS and internal apps are connected, but how. This includes OAuth tokens, API scopes, and data access levels. Shadow and user-installed integrations are flagged so you can assess their security posture at a glance.</p>

<p>With Wing, you can monitor third-party access continuously, enforce integration policies, and revoke risky connections before they become threats. 4. Compliance: yours and your vendors‚Äô
Let‚Äôs be honest - compliance has become a jungle due to IT democratization. From GDPR to SOC 2‚Ä¶ your organization‚Äôs compliance is hard to gauge when your employees use hundreds of SaaS tools and your data is scattered across more AI apps than you even know about.</p>

<p>You have two compliance challenges on the table: You need to make sure the apps in your stack are compliant and you also need to assure that your environment is under control should an audit take place. How to solve it:
You need visibility into all of the apps in your stack, but also how they add up when it comes to compliance. Wing gives you what you need by identifying all apps in use and if they are compliant with industry regulations like SOC2. Bottom line?</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre subject to an audit, you‚Äôll be ready. 5. Offboarding: the users you forgot about
IT democratization didn‚Äôt just change how tools get adopted, but how access gets removed. When employees leave, their personal app accounts, browser extensions, and third-party integrations often stick around.</p>

<p>Still active, connected and accessing corporate data. This creates a serious security risk. Former employees often retain active OAuth tokens connected to corporate systems. Tools connected through personal accounts may continue to sync sensitive company data to external environments, creating hidden data exposure risks.</p>

<p>Even if the employee left the company on good terms, their leftover access can later be exploited if their accounts are compromised. And because many of these apps aren‚Äôt visible to IT security, they are extra risky. How to solve it:
You need to be able to see all identities connected to applications in your system - both human and non-human. Both active and stale, including those no longer with the company.</p>

<p>Wing detects lingering accounts, tokens, and app access tied to former employees, even across apps you didn‚Äôt know they used, ensuring nothing stays connected that shouldn‚Äôt be. The bottom line
You can‚Äôt put the IT democratization genie back in the bottle. Your teams will keep exploring new tools, connecting apps, and experimenting with AI. But you also can‚Äôt turn a blind eye.</p>

<p>You need continuous visibility that helps you take back control over your quickly expanding attack surface. More than just having a list of all unsanctioned apps, you need to know who has access to them, if they pose a risk to your organization, and you need the ability to act fast if a response is necessary. Context is key when it comes to securing the application attack surface. Wing helps you embrace agility without sacrificing safety.</p>

<p>We bring visibility to your chaos and control back to your team, without slowing your organization down. Ready to see what‚Äôs hiding in your stack? See what Wing can show you. Found this article interesting?</p>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a nascent Android remote access trojan (RAT) called
PlayPraetor
that has infected more than 11,000 devices, primarily across Portugal, Spain, France, Morocco, Peru, and Hong Kong. ‚ÄúThe botnet‚Äôs rapid growth, which now exceeds 2,000 new infections per week, is driven by aggressive campaigns focusing on Spanish and French speakers, indicating a strategic shift away from its previous common victim base,‚Äù Cleafy researchers Simone Mattia, Alessandro Strino, and Federico Valentini
said
in an analysis of the malware. PlayPraetor, managed by a Chinese command-and-control (C2) panel, doesn‚Äôt significantly deviate from other Android trojans in that it abuses accessibility services to gain remote control and can serve fake overlay login screens atop nearly 200 banking apps and cryptocurrency wallets in an attempt to hijack victim accounts. PlayPraetor was
first documented
by CTM360 in March 2025, detailing the operation‚Äôs use of thousands of fraudulent Google Play Store download pages to perpetrate an interconnected large-scale scam campaign that can harvest banking credentials, monitor clipboard activity, and log keystrokes.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe links to the impersonated Play Store pages are distributed through Meta Ads and SMS messages to effectively reach a wide audience,‚Äù the Bahrain-based company noted at the time. ‚ÄúThese deceptive ads and messages trick users to click on the links, leading them to the fraudulent domains hosting the malicious APKs.‚Äù
Assessed to be a globally coordinated operation, PlayPraetor
comes
in five different variants that install deceptive Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), WebView-based apps (Phish), exploit accessibility services for persistent and C2 (Phantom), facilitate invite code-based phishing and trick users into purchasing counterfeit products (Veil), and grant full remote control via EagleSpy and SpyNote (RAT). The Phantom variant of PlayPraetor, per the Italian fraud prevention company, is capable of on-device fraud (
ODF
) and is dominated by two principal affiliate operators who control about 60% of the botnet (roughly 4,500 compromised devices) and appear to center their efforts around Portuguese-speaking targets. ‚ÄúIts core functionality relies on abusing Android‚Äôs accessibility services to gain extensive, real-time control over a compromised device,‚Äù Cleafy said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis allows an operator to perform fraudulent actions directly on the victim‚Äôs device.‚Äù

Once installed, the malware beacons out to the C2 server via HTTP/HTTPS and makes use of a WebSocket connection to create a bidirectional channel to issue commands. It also sets up a Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) connection to initiate a video livestream of the infected device‚Äôs screen. The evolving nature of the supported commands indicates that PlayPraetor is being actively developed by its operators, allowing for comprehensive data theft. In recent weeks, attacks distributing the malware have increasingly targeted Spanish- and Arabic-speaking victims, signaling a broader expansion of the malware-as-a-service (MaaS) offering.</p>

<p>The C2 panel, for its part, is not only used to actively interact with compromised devices in real-time, but also enable the creation of bespoke malware delivery pages that mimic Google Play Store on both desktop and mobile devices. ‚ÄúThe campaign‚Äôs success is built upon a well-established operational methodology, leveraging a multi-affiliate MaaS model,‚Äù Cleafy said. ‚ÄúThis structure allows for broad and highly targeted campaigns.‚Äù
PlayPraetor is the latest malware originating from Chinese-speaking threat actors with an aim to conduct financial fraud, a trend exemplified by the emergence of
ToxicPanda
and
SuperCard X
over the past year. ToxicPanda Evolves
According to data from Bitsight, ToxicPanda has compromised around 3,000 Android devices in Portugal, followed by Spain, Greece, Morocco and Peru.</p>

<p>Campaigns distributing the malware have leveraged TAG-1241, a traffic distribution system (TDS), for malware distribution using
ClickFix
and fake Google Chrome update lures. ‚ÄúThis carefully orchestrated redirection is part of the TDS‚Äôs design to ensure that only selected targets are funneled to these malicious endpoints,‚Äù security researcher Pedro Fal√©
said
in a report last week. The latest version of ToxicPanda improves upon its predecessors by incorporating a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) to establish C2 and enhance operational resilience in the face of infrastructure takedowns. Also baked into the malware are new commands to set a fallback C2 domain and better control malicious overlays.</p>

<p>DoubleTrouble Rises
The findings come as Zimperium disclosed another sophisticated Android banking trojan dubbed DoubleTrouble that has evolved beyond overlay attacks to record the device screen, log keystrokes, and run various commands for data exfiltration and entrenched device control. Besides leaning heavily on abusing Android‚Äôs accessibility services to carry out its fraudulent activities, DoubleTrouble‚Äôs distribution strategy involves leveraging bogus websites that host malware samples directly within Discord channels. ‚ÄúThe new functionalities include: displaying malicious UI overlays to steal PIN codes or unlock patterns, comprehensive screen recording capabilities, the ability to block the opening of specific applications, and advanced keylogging functionality,‚Äù Zimperium zLabs researcher Vishnu Madhav
said

<h2 id="cl-sta-0969-installs-covert-malware-in-telecom-networks-during-10-month-espionage-campaign"><a id="article-9"></a>CL-STA-0969 Installs Covert Malware in Telecom Networks During 10-Month Espionage Campaign</h2>

<p>Telecommunications organizations in Southeast Asia have been targeted by a state-sponsored threat actor known as
CL-STA-0969
to facilitate remote control over compromised networks. Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 said it observed multiple incidents in the region, including one aimed at critical telecommunications infrastructure between February and November 2024. The attacks are characterized by the use of several tools to enable remote access, as well as the deployment of Cordscan, which can collect location data from mobile devices. However, the cybersecurity company said it found no evidence of data exfiltration from the networks and systems it investigated.</p>

<p>Nor were any efforts made by the attackers to track or communicate with target devices within mobile networks. ‚ÄúThe threat actor behind CL-STA-0969 maintained high operational security (OPSEC) and employed various defense evasion techniques to avoid detection,‚Äù security researchers Renzon Cruz, Nicolas Bareil, and Navin Thomas
said
. CL-STA-0969, per Unit 42, shares significant overlaps with a cluster tracked by CrowdStrike under the name
Liminal Panda
, a China-nexus espionage group that has been attributed to attacks directed against telecommunications entities in South Asia and Africa since at least 2020 with the goal of intelligence gathering. It‚Äôs worth noting that some aspects of Liminal Panda‚Äôs tradecraft were previously attributed to another threat actor called
LightBasin
(aka UNC1945), which has also singled out the telecom sector since 2016.</p>

<p>LightBasin, for its part, overlaps with a third cluster dubbed
UNC2891
, a financially motivated crew known for its attacks on Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) infrastructure. ‚ÄúWhile this cluster significantly overlaps with Liminal Panda, we have also observed overlaps in attacker tooling with other reported groups and activity clusters, including Light Basin,
UNC3886
, UNC2891, and UNC1945,‚Äù the researchers pointed out. In at least one case, CL-STA-0969 is believed to have employed brute-force attacks against SSH authentication mechanisms for initial compromise, leveraging the access to drop various implants such as -
AuthDoor
, a malicious Pluggable Authentication Module (
PAM
) that works similar to SLAPSTICK (originally attributed to UNC1945) to conduct credential theft and provide persistent access to the compromised host via a hard-coded magic password
Cordscan
, a network scanning and packet capture utility (previously attributed to Liminal Panda)
GTPDOOR
, a malware explicitly
designed
to be deployed in telecom networks that are adjacent to GPRS roaming exchanges
EchoBackdoor
, a passive backdoor that listens for ICMP echo request packets containing command-and-control (C2) instructions to extract the command and send the results of the execution back to the server via an unencrypted ICMP Echo Reply packet
Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) Emulator (
sgsnemu
)
, an emulation software to tunnel traffic via the telecommunications network and bypass firewall restrictions (previously attributed to Liminal Panda)
ChronosRAT
, a modular ELF binary that‚Äôs capable of shellcode execution, file operations, keylogging, port forwarding, remote shell, screenshot capture, and proxy capabilities
NoDepDNS
(internally referred to as MyDns), a Golang backdoor that creates a raw socket and passively listens for UDP traffic on port 53 to parse incoming commands via DNS messages
‚ÄúCL-STA-0969 leveraged different shell scripts that established a reverse SSH tunnel along with other functionalities,‚Äù Unit 42 researchers noted. ‚ÄúCL-STA-0969 systematically clears logs and deletes executables when they are no longer needed, to maintain a high degree of OPSEC.‚Äù
Adding to the already broad portfolio of malicious tools that the threat actor has deployed are
Microsocks proxy
, Fast Reverse Proxy (
FRP
),
FScan
,
Responder
, and
ProxyChains
, as well as programs to exploit flaws in Linux and UNIX-based systems (CVE-2016-5195, CVE-2021-4034, and CVE-2021-3156) to achieve privilege escalation.</p>

<p>Besides using a combination of bespoke and publicly available tooling, the threat actors have been found to adopt a number of strategies to fly under the radar. This encompasses DNS tunneling of traffic, routing traffic through compromised mobile operators, erasing authentication logs, disabling Security-Enhanced Linux (
SELinux
), and disguising process names with convincing names that match the target environment. ‚ÄúCL-STA-0969 demonstrates a deep understanding of telecommunications protocols and infrastructure,‚Äù Unit 42 said. ‚ÄúIts malware, tools and techniques reveal a calculated effort to maintain persistent, stealthy access.</p>

<p>It achieved this by proxying traffic through other telecom nodes, tunneling data using less-scrutinized protocols and employing various defense evasion techniques.‚Äù
China Accuses U.S. Agencies of Targeting Military and Research Institutions
The disclosure comes as the National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team/Coordination Center of China (CNCERT)
accused
U.S. intelligence agencies of weaponizing a Microsoft Exchange zero-day exploit to steal defense-related information and hijack more than 50 devices belonging to a ‚Äúmajor Chinese military enterprise‚Äù between July 2022 and July 2023. The agency also said high-tech military-related universities, scientific research institutes, and enterprises in the country were targeted as part of these attacks to siphon valuable data from compromised hosts.</p>

<p>Among those targeted was a Chinese military enterprise in the communications and satellite internet sectors that was attacked from July to November of 2024 by exploiting vulnerabilities in electronic file systems, CNCERT alleged. The attribution effort
mirrors tactics from the West
, which has repeatedly blamed China for major cyber attacks, counting the latest zero-day exploitation of Microsoft SharePoint Server vulnerabilities. Asked last month about Chinese hacking into U.S. telecom systems and theft of intellectual property on Fox News, U.S.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump
said
, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think we do that to them? We do. We do a lot of things. That‚Äôs the way the world works.</p>

<h2 id="akira-ransomware-exploits-sonicwall-vpns-in-likely-zero-day-attack-on-fully-patched-devices"><a id="article-10"></a>Akira Ransomware Exploits SonicWall VPNs in Likely Zero-Day Attack on Fully-Patched Devices</h2>

<p>SonicWall SSL VPN devices have become the target of Akira ransomware attacks as part of a newfound surge in activity observed in late July 2025. ‚ÄúIn the intrusions reviewed, multiple pre-ransomware intrusions were observed within a short period of time, each involving VPN access through SonicWall SSL VPNs,‚Äù Arctic Wolf Labs researcher Julian Tuin
said
in a report. The cybersecurity company suggested that the attacks could be exploiting an as-yet-undetermined security flaw in the appliances, meaning a zero-day vulnerability, given that some of the incidents affected fully-patched SonicWall devices. However, the possibility of credential-based attacks for initial access hasn‚Äôt been ruled out.</p>

<p>The uptick in attacks involving SonicWall SSL VPNs was first registered on July 15, 2025, although Arctic Wolf said that it has observed similar malicious VPN logins
as far back as October 2024
, suggesting sustained efforts to target the devices. ‚ÄúA short interval was observed between initial SSL VPN account access and ransomware encryption,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúIn contrast with legitimate VPN logins which typically originate from networks operated by broadband internet service providers, ransomware groups often use Virtual Private Server hosting for VPN authentication in compromised environments.‚Äù
Queries sent to SonicWall for further details on the activity did not elicit a response until the publishing of this article. As mitigations, organizations are advised to consider disabling the SonicWall SSL VPN service until a patch is made available and deployed, given the likelihood of a zero-day vulnerability.</p>

<p>Other best practices include enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for remote access, deleting inactive or unused local firewall user accounts, and following password hygiene. As of early 2024, Akira ransomware actors are
estimated
to have extorted approximately $42 million in illicit proceeds after targeting more than 250 victims. It first emerged in March 2023. Statistics shared by Check Point show that Akira was the second most active group in the second quarter of 2025 after Qilin, claiming 143 victims during the time period.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAkira ransomware maintains a special focus on Italy, with 10% of its victims from Italian companies compared to 3% in the general ecosystem,‚Äù the cybersecurity company

<h2 id="cursor-ai-code-editor-fixed-flaw-allowing-attackers-to-run-commands-via-prompt-injection"><a id="article-11"></a>Cursor AI Code Editor Fixed Flaw Allowing Attackers to Run Commands via Prompt Injection</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a now-patched, high-severity security flaw in Cursor, a popular artificial intelligence (AI) code editor, that could result in remote code execution (RCE). The vulnerability, tracked as
CVE-2025-54135
(CVSS score: 8.6), has been addressed in
version 1.3
released on July 29, 2025. It has been codenamed CurXecute by Aim‚ÄØLabs, which previously disclosed
EchoLeak
. ‚ÄúCursor runs with developer‚Äëlevel privileges, and when paired with an MCP server that fetches untrusted external data, that data can redirect the agent‚Äôs control flow and exploit those privileges,‚Äù the Aim Labs Team
said
in a report shared with The Hacker News.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBy feeding poisoned data to the agent via MCP, an attacker can gain full remote code execution under the user privileges, and achieve any number of things, including opportunities for ransomware, data theft, AI manipulation and hallucinations, etc.‚Äù
In other words, the remote code execution can triggered by a single externally‚Äëhosted prompt‚Äëinjection that silently rewrites‚ÄØthe ‚Äú~/.cursor/mcp.json‚Äù file and runs attacker‚Äëcontrolled commands. The vulnerability is similar to EchoLeak in that the tools, which are exposed by Model Control Protocol (MCP) servers for use by AI models and facilitate interaction with external systems, such as querying databases or invoking APIs, could fetch untrusted data that can poison the agent‚Äôs expected behavior. Specifically, Aim Security found that the
mcp.json file
used to configure custom MCP servers in Cursor can trigger the execution of any new entry (e.g., adding a Slack MCP server) without requiring any confirmation. This
auto-run mode
is particularly dangerous because it can lead to the automatic execution of a malicious payload that‚Äôs injected by the attacker via a Slack message.</p>

<p>The attack sequence proceeds as follows -
User adds Slack MCP server via Cursor UI
Attacker posts message in a public Slack channel with the command injection payload
Victim opens a new chat and asks Cursor‚Äôs agent to use the newly configured Slack MCP server to summarize their messages in a prompt: ‚ÄúUse Slack tools to summarize my messages‚Äù
The agent encounters a specially crafted message designed to inject malicious commands to its context, for instance, altering the configuration file to add another MCP server containing a rogue instruction (‚Äútouch ~/&lt;file_containing_RCE_payload‚Äù)
‚ÄúThe core cause of the flaw is that new entries to the global MCP JSON file are starting automatically,‚Äù Aim Security said. ‚ÄúEven if the edit is rejected, the code execution had already happened.‚Äù
The entire attack is noteworthy for its simplicity. But it also highlights how AI-assisted tools can open up new attack surfaces when processing external content, in this case, any third-party MCP server. ‚ÄúAs AI agents keep bridging external, internal, and interactive worlds, security models must assume external context may affect the agent runtime - and monitor every hop,‚Äù the company added.</p>

<p>Version 1.3 of Cursor also addresses another issue with auto-run mode that can easily circumvent the platform‚Äôs denylist-based protections using methods like Base64-encoding, shell scripts, and enclosing shell commands within quotes (e.g., ‚Äúe‚Äùcho bypass) to execute unsafe commands. Following responsible disclosure by the BackSlash Research Team, Cursor has taken the step of altogether deprecating the denylist feature for auto-run in favor of an allowlist. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt expect the built-in security solutions provided by
vibe coding platforms
to be comprehensive or foolproof,‚Äù researchers Mustafa Naamneh and Micah Gold
said
. ‚ÄúThe onus is on end-user organizations to ensure agentic systems are equipped with proper guardrails.‚Äù
The disclosure comes as HiddenLayer also found that Cursor‚Äôs ineffective denylist approach can be weaponized by embedding hidden malicious instructions with a GitHub README.md file, allowing an attacker to steal API keys, SSH credentials, and even run blocked system commands.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhen the victim viewed the project on GitHub, the prompt injection was not visible, and they asked Cursor to git clone the project and help them set it up, a common occurrence for an IDE-based agentic system,‚Äù researchers Kasimir Schulz, Kenneth Yeung, and Tom Bonner
noted
. ‚ÄúHowever, after cloning the project and reviewing the readme to see the instructions to set up the project, the prompt injection took over the AI model and forced it to use the grep tool to find any keys in the user‚Äôs workspace before exfiltrating the keys with curl.‚Äù
HiddenLayer said it also found additional weaknesses that could be abused to leak Cursor‚Äôs system prompt by overriding the base URL provided for OpenAI API requests to a proxied model, as well as exfiltrate a user‚Äôs private SSH keys by leveraging two benign tools, read_file and create_diagram, in what‚Äôs called a tool combination attack. This essentially involves inserting a prompt injection command within a GitHub README.md file that‚Äôs parsed by Cursor when the victim user asks the code editor to summarize the file, resulting in the execution of the command. The hidden instruction, for its part, uses the read_file tool to read private SSH keys belonging to the user and then utilizes the create_diagram tool to exfiltrate the keys to an attacker-controlled webhook.site URL.</p>

<p>All the identified shortcomings have been remediated by Cursor in version 1.3. News of various vulnerabilities in Cursor comes as Tracebit devised an attack targeting Google‚Äôs
Gemini CLI
, an open-source command-line tool fine-tuned for coding tasks, that exploited a default configuration of the tool to surreptitiously exfiltrate sensitive data to an attacker-controlled server using curl. Like observed in the case of Cursor, the attack requires the victim to (1) instruct Gemini CLI to interact with an attacker-created GitHub codebase containing a nefarious
indirect prompt injection
in the
GEMINI.md context file
and (2) add a benign command to an allowlist (e.g., grep). ‚ÄúPrompt injection targeting these elements, together with significant validation and display issues within Gemini CLI could cause undetectable arbitrary code execution,‚Äù Tracebit founder and CTO Sam Cox
said
.</p>

<p>To mitigate the risk posed by the attack, Gemini CLI users are advised to upgrade their installations to
version 0.1.14

<h2 id="attackers-use-fake-oauth-apps-with-tycoon-kit-to-breach-microsoft-365-accounts"><a id="article-12"></a>Attackers Use Fake OAuth Apps with Tycoon Kit to Breach Microsoft 365 Accounts</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have detailed a new cluster of activity where threat actors are impersonating enterprises with fake
Microsoft OAuth applications
to facilitate credential harvesting as part of account takeover attacks. ‚ÄúThe fake Microsoft 365 applications impersonate various companies, including RingCentral, SharePoint, Adobe, and Docusign,‚Äù Proofpoint
said
in a Thursday report. The ongoing campaign, first detected in early 2025, is designed to use the OAuth applications as a gateway to obtain unauthorized access to users‚Äô Microsoft 365 accounts by means of
phishing kits
like
Tycoon
and ODx that are capable of conducting multi-factor authentication (MFA) phishing. The enterprise security company said it observed the approach being used in email campaigns with more than 50 impersonated applications.</p>

<p>The attacks begin with phishing emails sent from compromised accounts and aim to trick recipients into clicking on URLs under the pretext of sharing requests for quotes (RFQ) or business contract agreements. Clicking on these links directs the victim to a Microsoft OAuth page for an application named ‚ÄúiLSMART‚Äù that asks them to grant it permissions to view their basic profile and maintain continued access to the data that they have been granted access to. What makes this attack notable is the impersonation of ILSMart, a legitimate online marketplace for aviation, marine, and defense industries to buy and sell parts and repair services. ‚ÄúThe applications‚Äô permissions would provide limited use to an attacker, but it is used for setting up the next stage of the attack,‚Äù Proofpoint said.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether the target accepted or denied the permissions requested, they are first redirected to a CAPTCHA page and then to a phony Microsoft account authentication page once the verification is complete. This fake Microsoft page makes use of adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) phishing techniques powered by the Tycoon Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS) platform to harvest the victim‚Äôs credentials and MFA codes. As recently as last month, Proofpoint said it detected another campaign impersonating Adobe in which the emails are sent via Twilio SendGrid, an email marketing platform, and are engineered with the same goal in mind: To gain user authorization or trigger a cancellation flow that redirects the victim to a phishing page. The campaign represents just a drop in the bucket when compared to overall Tycoon-related activity, with the multiple clusters leveraging the toolkit to perform account takeover attacks.</p>

<p>In 2025 alone, attempted account compromises affecting nearly 3,000 user accounts spanning more than 900 Microsoft 365 environments have been observed. ‚ÄúThreat actors are creating increasingly innovative attack chains in an attempt to bypass detections and obtain access to organizations globally,‚Äù the company said, adding it ‚Äúanticipates threat actors will increasingly target users‚Äô identity, with AiTM credential phishing becoming the criminal industry standard.‚Äù
As of last month, Microsoft has
announced
plans to update default settings to improve security by blocking legacy authentication protocols and requiring admin consent for third-party app access. The updates are expected to be completed by August 2025. ‚ÄúThis update will have a positive impact on the landscape overall and will hamstring threat actors that use this technique,‚Äù Proofpoint pointed out.</p>

<p>The disclosure follows Microsoft‚Äôs
decision
to disable external workbook links to blocked file types by default between October 2025 and July 2026 in an attempt to enhance workbook security. The findings also come as spear-phishing emails bearing purported payment receipts are used to deploy by means of an AutoIt-based injector a piece of .NET malware called
VIP Keylogger
that can steal sensitive data from compromised hosts, Seqrite
said
. Over the course of several months, spam campaigns have been spotted concealing installation links to remote desktop software inside PDF files so as to bypass email and malware defenses. The campaign is believed to have been ongoing since November 2024, primarily targeting entities in France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and Germany.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThese PDFs are often disguised to look like invoices, contracts, or property listings to enhance credibility and lure victims into clicking the embedded link,‚Äù WithSecure
said
. ‚ÄúThis design was intended to create the illusion of legitimate content that has been obscured, prompting the victim to install a program. In this case, the program was FleetDeck RMM.‚Äù
Other Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) tools deployed as part of the activity cluster include Action1, OptiTune, Bluetrait, Syncro, SuperOps, Atera, and ScreenConnect. ‚ÄúAlthough no post-infection payloads have been observed, the use of RMM tools strongly suggests their role as an initial access vector, potentially enabling further malicious activity,‚Äù the Finnish company added.</p>

<p>‚ÄúRansomware operators in particular have favoured this approach.‚Äù

<h2 id="ai-generated-malicious-npm-package-drains-solana-funds-from-1500-before-takedown"><a id="article-13"></a>AI-Generated Malicious npm Package Drains Solana Funds from 1,500+ Before Takedown</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have flagged a malicious npm package that was generated using artificial intelligence (AI) and concealed a cryptocurrency wallet drainer. The package, @kodane/patch-manager, claims to offer ‚Äúadvanced license validation and registry optimization utilities for high-performance Node.js applications.‚Äù It was uploaded to npm by a user named ‚ÄúKodane‚Äù on July 28, 2025. The package is no longer available for download from the registry, but not before it attracted over 1,500 downloads. Software supply chain security company Safety, which
discovered
the library, said the malicious features are advertised directly in the source code, calling it an ‚Äúenhanced stealth wallet drainer.‚Äù
Specifically, the behavior is triggered as part of a postinstall script that drops its payload within hidden directories across Windows, Linux, and macOS systems, and then proceeds to connect to a command-and-control (C2) server at ‚Äúsweeper-monitor-production.up.railway[.]app.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe script generates a unique machine ID code for the compromised host and shares that with the C2 server,‚Äù Paul McCarty, head of research at Safety, said, noting that the C2 server lists two compromised machines.</p>

<p>In the npm ecosystem, postinstall scripts are often overlooked attack vectors‚Äîthey run automatically after a package is installed, meaning users can be compromised without ever executing the package manually. This creates a dangerous blind spot, especially in CI/CD environments where dependencies are updated routinely without direct human review. The malware is designed to scan the system for the presence of a wallet file, and if found, it proceeds to drain all funds from the wallet to a hard-coded wallet address on the Solana blockchain. While this is not the first time
cryptocurrency drainers
have been
identified
in open-source repositories, what makes @kodane/patch-manager stand out are clues that suggest the use of Anthropic‚Äôs Claude AI chatbot to generate it.</p>

<p>This includes the presence of emojis, extensive JavaScript console logging messages, well-written and descriptive comments, the README.md markdown file written in a style that‚Äôs consistent with Claude-generated markdown files, and Claude‚Äôs pattern of calling code changes as ‚ÄúEnhanced.‚Äù
The discovery of the npm package highlights ‚Äúhow threat actors are leveraging AI to create more convincing and dangerous malware,‚Äù McCarty said. The incident also underlines growing concerns in software supply chain security, where AI-generated packages may bypass conventional defenses by appearing clean or even helpful. This raises the stakes for package maintainers and security teams, who now need to monitor not just known malware, but increasingly polished, AI-assisted threats that exploit trusted ecosystems like npm.
