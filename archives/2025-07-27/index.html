<h2 id="us-sanctions-firm-behind-n-korean-it-scheme-arizona-woman-jailed-for-running-laptop-farm"><a id="article-1"></a>U.S. Sanctions Firm Behind N. Korean IT Scheme; Arizona Woman Jailed for Running Laptop Farm</h2>

<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury‚Äôs Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned a North Korean front company and three associated individuals for their involvement in the fraudulent remote
information technology (IT) worker scheme
designed to generate illicit revenues for Pyongyang. The sanctions target Korea Sobaeksu Trading Company (aka Sobaeksu United Corporation), and Kim Se Un, Jo Kyong Hun, and Myong Chol Min for evading sanctions imposed by the U.S. and the United Nations against the Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea (DPRK) government.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOur commitment is clear: Treasury, as part of a whole-of-government effort, will continue to hold accountable those who seek to infiltrate global supply chains and enable the sanctions evasion activities that further the Kim regime‚Äôs destabilizing agenda,‚Äù
said
Director of OFAC Bradley T. Smith. The latest action marks the U.S. government‚Äôs
continued efforts
to dismantle North Korea‚Äôs wide-ranging revenue generation schemes and fund its illegal nuclear and ballistic missile programs.</p>

<p>The IT worker scheme, which has mutated into a global threat, entails the DPRK regime dispatching highly skilled IT workers to various locations, including China, Russia, and Vietnam, to obtain remote jobs and infiltrate U.S. companies and elsewhere using a combination of fraudulent documents, stolen identities, and false personas, often with help from facilitators who run laptop farms. In what has been described as a recurring, if ‚Äúbaffling,‚Äù theme, many of these fake workers have been
found
to use Minions and other Despicable Me characters in social-media profiles and email addresses. ‚ÄúThe DPRK government withholds most of the wages earned by IT workers, generating hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue to support the North Korean regime‚Äôs unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs,‚Äù the Treasury said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIn some cases, these DPRK IT workers have introduced malware into company networks to exfiltrate proprietary and sensitive data.‚Äù
The development comes merely weeks after OFAC
sanctioned
Song Kum Hyok, a 38-year-old member of a North Korean hacking group called Andariel, for their role in the IT worker scheme. In related news, Christina Marie Chapman, 50, of Arizona, was sentenced to 8.5 years in prison for running a laptop farm for IT workers to give the impression that they were working remotely within the U.S. when, in reality, they were logging into those machines remotely. Chapman
pleaded guilty
earlier this February.</p>

<p>The impacted companies included a top-five major television network, a Silicon Valley technology company, an aerospace manufacturer, an American car maker, a luxury retail store, and a U.S. media and entertainment company. The IT workers also unsuccessfully attempted to land jobs at two different U.S. government agencies.</p>

<p>The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) seized more than 90 laptops from Chapman‚Äôs home during an October 2023 raid. Chapman is also said to have 49 laptops at locations overseas, including multiple shipments to a Chinese city on the North Korean border. In all, the elaborate counterfeit operation netted more than $17 million in illicit revenue for Chapman and North Korea from October 2020 to October 2023.</p>

<p>Chapman has also been ordered to serve three years of supervised release, to forfeit $284,556 that was to be paid to the North Koreans, and to pay a judgment of $176,850. ‚ÄúChristina Chapman perpetrated a years‚Äô long scheme that resulted in millions of dollars raised for the DPRK regime, exploited more than 300 American companies and government agencies, and stole dozens of identities of American citizens,‚Äù

<h2 id="patchwork-targets-turkish-defense-firms-with-spear-phishing-using-malicious-lnk-files"><a id="article-2"></a>Patchwork Targets Turkish Defense Firms with Spear-Phishing Using Malicious LNK Files</h2>

<p>The threat actor known as
Patchwork
has been attributed to a new spear-phishing campaign targeting Turkish defense contractors with the goal of gathering strategic intelligence. ‚ÄúThe campaign employs a five-stage execution chain delivered via malicious LNK files disguised as conference invitations sent to targets interested in learning more about unmanned vehicle systems,‚Äù Arctic Wolf Labs
said
in a technical report published this week. The activity, which also singled out an unnamed manufacturer of precision-guided missile systems, appears to be geopolitically motivated as the timing coincides amid deepening defense cooperation between Pakistan and T√ºrkiye, and the recent India-Pakistan military skirmishes. Patchwork, also called APT-C-09, APT-Q-36, Chinastrats, Dropping Elephant, Operation Hangover, Quilted Tiger, and Zinc Emerson, is assessed to be a state-sponsored actor of Indian origin.</p>

<p>Known to be active since at least 2009, the hacking group has a
track record
of striking entities in China, Pakistan, and other countries in South Asia. Exactly a year ago, the Knownsec 404 Team
documented
Patchwork‚Äôs targeting entities with ties to Bhutan to deliver the Brute Ratel C4 framework and an updated version of a backdoor called PGoShell. Since the start of 2025, the threat actor has been linked to various campaigns
aimed at Chinese universities
, with recent attacks
using baits
related to power grids in the country to deliver a Rust-based loader that, in turn, decrypts and launches a C# trojan called Protego to harvest a wide range of information from compromised Windows systems. Another report published by Chinese cybersecurity firm QiAnXin back in May
said
it identified infrastructure overlaps between Patchwork and
DoNot Team
(aka APT-Q-38 or Bellyworm), suggesting potential operational connections between the two threat clusters.</p>

<p>The targeting of T√ºrkiye by the hacking group points to an expansion of its targeting footprint, using malicious Windows shortcut (LNK) files distributed via phishing emails as a starting point to kick-off the multi-stage infection process. Specifically, the LNK file is designed to invoke PowerShell commands that are responsible for fetching additional payloads from an external server (‚Äúexpouav[.]org‚Äù), a domain created on June 25, 2025, that hosts a PDF lure mimicking an international conference on unmanned vehicle systems, details of which are hosted on the legitimate waset[.]org website. ‚ÄúThe PDF document serves as a visual decoy, designed to distract the user while the rest of the execution chain runs silently in the background,‚Äù Arctic Wolf said. ‚ÄúThis targeting occurs as T√ºrkiye commands 65% of the global UAV export market and develops critical hypersonic missile capabilities, while simultaneously strengthening defense ties with Pakistan during a period of heightened India-Pakistan tensions.‚Äù
Among the downloaded artifacts is a malicious DLL that‚Äôs launched using DLL side-loading by means of a scheduled task, ultimately leading to the execution of shellcode that carries out extensive reconnaissance of the compromised host, including taking screenshots, and exfiltrating the details back to the server.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis represents a significant evolution of this threat actor‚Äôs capabilities, transitioning from the x64 DLL variants observed in November 2024, to the current x86 PE executables with enhanced command structures,‚Äù the company said. ‚ÄúDropping Elephant demonstrates continued operational investment and development through architectural diversification from x64 DLL to x86 PE formats, and enhanced C2 protocol implementation through impersonation of legitimate websites.‚Äù

<h2 id="cyber-espionage-campaign-hits-russian-aerospace-sector-using-eaglet-backdoor"><a id="article-3"></a>Cyber Espionage Campaign Hits Russian Aerospace Sector Using EAGLET Backdoor</h2>

<p>Russian aerospace and defense industries have become the target of a cyber espionage campaign that delivers a backdoor called EAGLET to facilitate data exfiltration. The activity, dubbed Operation
CargoTalon
, has been assigned to a threat cluster tracked as
UNG0901
(short for Unknown Group 901). ‚ÄúThe campaign is aimed at targeting employees of Voronezh Aircraft Production Association (VASO), one of the major aircraft production entities in Russia via using —Ç–æ–≤–∞—Ä–Ω–æ-—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å–ø–æ—Ä—Ç–Ω–∞—è –Ω–∞–∫–ª–∞–¥–Ω–∞—è (TTN) documents ‚Äî critical to Russian logistics operations,‚Äù Seqrite Labs researcher Subhajeet Singha
said
in an analysis published this week. The attack commences with a spear-phishing email bearing cargo delivery-themed lures that contain a ZIP archive, within which is a Windows shortcut (LNK) file that uses PowerShell to display a decoy Microsoft Excel document, while also deploying the EAGLET DLL implant on the host.</p>

<p>The decoy document, per Seqrite, references Obltransterminal, a Russian railway container terminal operator that was
sanctioned
by the U.S. Department of the Treasury‚Äôs Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in February 2024. EAGLET is designed to gather system information and establish a connection to a hard-coded remote server (‚Äú185.225.17[.]104‚Äù) in order to process the HTTP response from the server and extract the commands to be executed on the compromised Windows machine. The implant supports shell access and the ability to upload/download files, although the exact nature of the next-stage payloads delivered through this method is unknown, given that the command-and-control (C2) server is currently offline.</p>

<p>Seqrite said it also uncovered similar campaigns targeting the Russian military sector with EAGLET, not to mention source code and targeting overlaps with another threat cluster tracked as
Head Mare
that‚Äôs known to target Russian entities. This includes the functional parallels between EAGLET and
PhantomDL
, a Go-based backdoor with a shell and file download/upload feature, as well as the similarities in the naming scheme used for the phishing message attachments. The disclosure comes as the Russian state-sponsored hacking group called
UAC-0184
(aka Hive0156) has been attributed to a fresh attack wave targeting victims in Ukraine with Remcos RAT as recently as this month. While the threat actor has a history of delivering Remcos RAT since early 2024, newly spotted
attack chains distributing the malware
have been simplified, employing weaponized LNK or PowerShell files to retrieve the decoy file and the Hijack Loader (aka IDAT Loader) payload, which then launches Remcos RAT.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHive0156 delivers weaponized Microsoft LNK and PowerShell files, leading to the download and execution of Remcos RAT,‚Äù IBM X-Force
said
, adding it ‚Äúobserved key decoy documents featuring themes that suggest a focus on the Ukrainian military and evolving to a potential wider audience.‚Äù

<h2 id="soco404-and-koske-malware-target-cloud-services-with-cross-platform-cryptomining-attacks"><a id="article-5"></a>Soco404 and Koske Malware Target Cloud Services with Cross-Platform Cryptomining Attacks</h2>

<p>Threat hunters have disclosed two different malware campaigns that have targeted vulnerabilities and misconfigurations across cloud environments to deliver cryptocurrency miners. The threat activity clusters have been codenamed
Soco404
and
Koske
by cloud security firms Wiz and Aqua, respectively. Soco404 ‚Äútargets both Linux and Windows systems, deploying platform-specific malware,‚Äù Wiz researchers Maor Dokhanian, Shahar Dorfman, and Avigayil Mechtinger
said
. ‚ÄúThey use process masquerading to disguise malicious activity as legitimate system processes.‚Äù
The activity is a reference to the fact that payloads are embedded in fake 404 HTML pages hosted on websites built using Google Sites.</p>

<p>The bogus sites have since been taken down by Google. Wiz posited that the campaign, which has been previously observed going after
Apache Tomcat services
with weak credentials, as well as susceptible
Apache Struts and Atlassian Confluence servers
using the
Sysrv
botnet, is part of a broader crypto-scam infrastructure, including fraudulent cryptocurrency trading platforms. The latest campaign has also been found to target publicly-accessible PostgreSQL instances, with the attackers also abusing compromised Apache Tomcat servers to host payloads tailored for both Linux and Windows environments. Also hacked by the attackers is a legitimate Korean transportation website for malware delivery.</p>

<p>Once initial access is obtained, PostgreSQL‚Äôs
COPY ‚Ä¶ FROM PROGRAM SQL command
is
exploited
to run arbitrary shell commands on the host and achieve remote code execution. ‚ÄúThe attacker behind Soco404 appears to be conducting automated scans for exposed services, aiming to exploit any accessible entry point,‚Äù Wiz said. ‚ÄúTheir use of a wide range of ingress tools, including Linux utilities like wget and curl, as well as Windows-native tools such as certutil and PowerShell, highlights an opportunistic strategy.‚Äù
On Linux systems, a dropper shell script is executed directly in memory to download and launch a next-stage payload, while simultaneously taking steps to terminate competing miners to maximize financial gain and limit forensic visibility by overwriting logs associated with cron and wtmp.</p>

<p>The payload executed in the next-stage is a binary that serves as a loader for the miner by contacting an external domain (‚Äúwww.fastsoco[.]top‚Äù) that‚Äôs based on Google Sites. The attack chain for Windows leverages the initial post-exploitation command to download and execute a Windows binary, which, like its Linux counterpart, functions akin to a loader that embeds both the miner and the
WinRing0.sys driver
, the latter being used to obtain NT\SYSTEM privileges. On top of that, the malware attempts to stop the Windows event log service and executes a self-deletion command to evade detection. ‚ÄúRather than relying on a single method or operating system, the attacker casts a wide net, deploying whichever tool or technique is available in the environment to deliver their payload,‚Äù the company said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis flexible approach is characteristic of a broad, automated cryptomining campaign focused on maximizing reach and persistence across varied targets.‚Äù
The discovery of Soco404 dovetails with the emergence of a new Linux threat dubbed Koske that‚Äôs suspected to be developed with assistance from a large language model (LLM) and uses seemingly innocuous images of pandas to propagate the malware. The attack starts with the exploitation of a misconfigured server, such as
JupyterLab
, to install various scripts from two JPEG images, including a C-based rootkit that‚Äôs used to hide malicious malware-related files using
LD_PRELOAD
and a shell script that ultimately downloads cryptocurrency miners on the infected system. Both payloads are directly executed in memory to avoid leaving traces on disk. Koske‚Äôs end goal is to deploy CPU and GPU-optimized cryptocurrency miners that take advantage of the host‚Äôs computational resources to mine 18 distinct coins, such as Monero, Ravencoin, Zano, Nexa, and Tari, among others.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThese images are polyglot files, with malicious payloads appended to the end. Once downloaded, the malware extracts and executes the malicious segments in memory, bypassing antivirus tools,‚Äù Aqua researcher Assaf Morag
said
. ‚ÄúThis technique isn‚Äôt steganography but rather polyglot file abuse or malicious file embedding. This technique uses a valid JPG file with malicious shellcode hidden at the end.</p>

<p>Only the last bytes are downloaded and executed, making it a sneaky form of polyglot abuse.‚Äù

<h2 id="overcoming-risks-from-chinese-genai-tool-usage"><a id="article-6"></a>Overcoming Risks from Chinese GenAI Tool Usage</h2>

<p>A recent analysis of enterprise data suggests that generative AI tools developed in China are being used extensively by employees in the US and UK, often without oversight or approval from security teams. The study, conducted by Harmonic Security, also identifies hundreds of instances in which sensitive data was uploaded to platforms hosted in China, raising concerns over compliance, data residency, and commercial confidentiality. Over a 30-day period, Harmonic examined the activity of a sample of 14,000 employees across a range of companies. Nearly 8 percent were found to have used China-based GenAI tools, including DeepSeek, Kimi Moonshot, Baidu Chat, Qwen (from Alibaba), and Manus.</p>

<p>These applications, while powerful and easy to access, typically provide little information on how uploaded data is handled, stored, or reused. The findings underline a widening gap between AI adoption and governance, especially in developer-heavy organizations where time-to-output often trumps policy compliance. If you‚Äôre looking for a way to enforce your AI usage policy with granular controls, contact
Harmonic Security
. Data Leakage at Scale
In total, over 17 megabytes of content were uploaded to these platforms by 1,059 users.</p>

<p>Harmonic identified 535 separate incidents involving sensitive information. Nearly one-third of that material consisted of source code or engineering documentation. The remainder included documents related to mergers and acquisitions, financial reports, personally identifiable information, legal contracts, and customer records. Harmonic‚Äôs study singled out DeepSeek as the most prevalent tool, associated with 85 percent of recorded incidents.</p>

<p>Kimi Moonshot and Qwen are also seeing uptake. Collectively, these services are reshaping how GenAI appears inside corporate networks. It‚Äôs not through sanctioned platforms, but through quiet, user-led adoption. Chinese GenAI services frequently operate under permissive or opaque data policies.</p>

<p>In some cases, platform terms allow uploaded content to be used for further model training. The implications are substantial for firms operating in regulated sectors or handling proprietary software and internal business plans. Policy Enforcement Through Technical Controls
Harmonic Security has developed tools to help enterprises regain control over how GenAI is used in the workplace. Its platform monitors AI activity in real time and enforces policy at the moment of use.</p>

<p>Companies have granular controls to block access to certain applications based on their HQ location, restrict specific types of data from being uploaded, and educate users through contextual prompts. Governance as a Strategic Imperative
The rise of unauthorized GenAI use inside enterprises is no longer hypothetical. Harmonic‚Äôs data show that nearly one in twelve employees is already interacting with Chinese GenAI platforms, often with no awareness of data retention risks or jurisdictional exposure. The findings suggest that awareness alone is insufficient.</p>

<p>Firms will require active, enforced controls if they are to enable GenAI adoption without compromising compliance or security. As the technology matures, the ability to govern its use may prove just as consequential as the performance of the models themselves. Harmonic makes it possible to embrace the benefits of GenAI without exposing your business to unnecessary risk. Learn more about how Harmonic helps enforce AI policies and protect sensitive data at

<h2 id="critical-mitel-flaw-lets-hackers-bypass-login-gain-full-access-to-mivoice-mx-one-systems"><a id="article-7"></a>Critical Mitel Flaw Lets Hackers Bypass Login, Gain Full Access to MiVoice MX-ONE Systems</h2>

<p>Mitel has released security updates to address a critical security flaw in MiVoice MX-ONE that could allow an attacker to bypass authentication protections. ‚ÄúAn authentication bypass vulnerability has been identified in the Provisioning Manager component of Mitel MiVoice MX-ONE, which, if successfully exploited, could allow an unauthenticated attacker to conduct an authentication bypass attack due to improper access control,‚Äù the company
said
in an advisory released Wednesday. ‚ÄúA successful exploit of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to user or admin accounts in the system.‚Äù
The shortcoming, which is yet to be assigned a CVE identifier, carries a CVSS score of 9.4 out of a maximum of 10.0. It affects MiVoice MX-ONE versions from 7.3 (7.3.0.0.50) to 7.8 SP1 (7.8.1.0.14).</p>

<p>Patches for the issue have been made available in MXO-15711_78SP0 and MXO-15711_78SP1 for MX-ONE versions 7.8 and 7.8 SP1, respectively. Customers using MiVoice MX-ONE version 7.3 and above are recommended to submit a patch request to their authorized service partner. As mitigations until fixes can be applied, it‚Äôs advised to limit direct exposure of MX-ONE services to the public internet and ensure that they are placed within a trusted network. Along with the authentication bypass flaw, Mitel has shipped updates to resolve a high-severity vulnerability in MiCollab (CVE-2025-52914, CVSS score: 8.8) that, if successfully exploited, could permit an authenticated attacker to carry out an SQL injection attack.</p>

<p>‚ÄúA successful exploit could allow an attacker to access user provisioning information and execute arbitrary SQL database commands with potential impacts on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system,‚Äù Mitel
said
. The vulnerability, which impacts MiCollab versions 10.0 (10.0.0.26) to 10.0 SP1 FP1 (10.0.1.101) and 9.8 SP3 (9.8.3.1) and earlier, has been resolved in versions 10.1 (10.1.0.10), 9.8 SP3 FP1 (9.8.3.103), and later. With shortcomings in Mitel devices
coming under
active attacks
in the past, it‚Äôs essential that users move quickly to update their installations as soon as possible to mitigate potential threats. Found this article interesting?</p>

<h2 id="fire-ant-exploits-vmware-flaws-to-compromise-esxi-hosts-and-vcenter-environments"><a id="article-8"></a>Fire Ant Exploits VMware Flaws to Compromise ESXi Hosts and vCenter Environments</h2>

<p>Virtualization and networking infrastructure have been targeted by a threat actor codenamed
Fire Ant
as part of a prolonged cyber espionage campaign. The activity, observed this year, is primarily designed Now to infiltrate organizations‚Äô VMware ESXi and vCenter environments as well as network appliances, Sygnia said in a new report published today. ‚ÄúThe threat actor leveraged combinations of sophisticated and stealthy techniques creating multilayered attack kill chains to facilitate access to restricted and segmented network assets within presumed to be isolated environments,‚Äù the cybersecurity company
said
. ‚ÄúThe attacker demonstrated a high degree of persistence and operational maneuverability, operating through eradication efforts, adapting in real time to eradication and containment actions to maintain access to the compromise infrastructure.‚Äù
Fire Ant is assessed to share tooling and targeting overlaps with prior campaigns orchestrated by
UNC3886
, a China-nexus cyber espionage group known for its persistent targeting of edge devices and virtualization technologies since at least 2022.</p>

<p>Attacks mounted by the threat actor have been found to establish entrenched control of VMware ESXi hosts and vCenter servers, demonstrating advanced capabilities to pivot into guest environments and bypass network segmentation by compromising network appliances. Another noteworthy aspect is the ability of the threat actor to maintain operational resilience by adapting to containment efforts, switching to different tools, dropping fallback backdoors for persistence, and altering network configurations to re-establish access to compromised networks. Fire Ant‚Äôs breach of the virtualization management layer is achieved by the exploitation of
CVE-2023-34048
, a known security flaw in VMware vCenter Server that has been exploited by UNC3886 as a zero-day for years prior to it being patched by Broadcom in October 2023. ‚ÄúFrom vCenter, they extracted the ‚Äòvpxuser‚Äô service account credentials and used them to access connected ESXi hosts,‚Äù Sygnia noted.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThey deployed multiple persistent backdoors on both ESXi hosts and the vCenter to maintain access across reboots. The backdoor filename, hash, and deployment technique aligned the VIRTUALPITA malware family.‚Äù
Also dropped is a Python-based implant (‚Äúautobackup.bin‚Äù) that provides remote command execution, and file download and upload capabilities. It runs in the background as a daemon. Upon gaining unauthorized access to the hypervisor, the attackers are said to have leveraged another flaw in VMware Tools (
CVE-2023-20867
) to interact directly with guest virtual machines via PowerCLI, as well as interfered with the functioning of security tools and extracted credentials from memory snapshots, including that of domain controllers.</p>

<p>Some of the other crucial aspects of the threat actor‚Äôs tradecraft are as follows -
Dropping V2Ray framework to facilitate guest network tunneling
Deploying unregistered virtual machines directly on multiple ESXi hosts
Breaking down network segmentation barriers by exploiting
CVE-2022-1388
to compromise F5 load balancers and establishing cross-segments persistence by deploying web shells
Resist incident response and remediation efforts by re-compromising assets and, in some cases, blend in by renaming their payloads to impersonate forensic tools
The attack chain ultimately opened up a pathway for Fire Ant to maintain persistent, covert access from the hypervisor to guest operating systems. Sygnia also described the adversary as possessing a ‚Äúdeep understanding‚Äù of the target environment‚Äôs network architecture and policies in order to reach otherwise isolated assets. Fire Ant is unusually focused on remaining undetected and leaves a minimal intrusion footprint. This is evidenced in the steps taken by the attackers to tamper with logging on ESXi hosts by terminating the ‚Äúvmsyslogd‚Äù process, effectively suppressing an audit trail and limiting forensic visibility.</p>

<p>The findings underscore a worrying trend involving the persistent and successful
targeting
of
network edge devices
by
threat actors
, particularly
those from China
, in recent years. ‚ÄúThis campaign underscores the importance of visibility and detection within the hypervisor and infrastructure layer, where traditional endpoint security tools are ineffective,‚Äù Sygnia said. ‚ÄúFire Ant consistently targeted infrastructure systems such as ESXi hosts, vCenter servers, and F5 load balancers. The targeted systems are rarely integrated into standard detection and response programs.</p>

<p>These assets lack detection and response solutions and generate limited telemetry, making them ideal long-term footholds for stealthy operation.‚Äù
The development comes a week after Singapore
pointed fingers at UNC3886
for carrying out cyber attacks targeting local critical infrastructure that delivers essential services. The government offered no further details. ‚ÄúUNC3886 poses a serious threat to us, and has the potential to undermine our national security,‚Äù Coordinating Minister for National Security, K. Shanmugam, said in a speech.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt is going after high value strategic threat targets, vital infrastructure that delivers essential services.‚Äù
In a Facebook post, the Chinese embassy in Singapore
said
such claims were ‚Äúgroundless smears and accusations,‚Äù and that the information systems of 9th Asian Winter Games were subjected to
over 270,000 cyber attacks
from abroad earlier this February. ‚ÄúIn addition to the recent context of the attribution disclosed by Singapore‚Äôs minister of national security, we can highlight that the group‚Äôs activity poses risks to critical infrastructure that extend beyond the regional borders of Singapore and the APJ region,‚Äù Yoav Mazor, Head of Incident Response at Sygnia, told The Hacker News. (The story was updated after publication to include a response from Sygnia.)

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have shed light on a new versatile malware loader called
CastleLoader
that has been put to use in campaigns distributing various information stealers and remote access trojans (RATs). The activity employs Cloudflare-themed
ClickFix
phishing attacks and fake GitHub repositories opened under the names of legitimate applications, Swiss cybersecurity company PRODAFT said in a report shared with The Hacker News. The malware loader, first observed in the wild earlier this year, has been used to distribute
DeerStealer
,
RedLine
,
StealC
,
NetSupport RAT
,
SectopRAT
, and even other loaders like
Hijack Loader
. ‚ÄúIt employs dead code injection and packing techniques to hinder analysis,‚Äù the company said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAfter unpacking itself at runtime, it connects to a C2 (command-and-control) server, downloads target modules, and executes them.‚Äù
CastleLoader‚Äôs modular structure allows it to act as both a delivery mechanism and a staging utility, enabling threat actors to separate initial infection from payload deployment. This separation complicates attribution and response because it decouples the infection vector from the eventual malware behavior, giving attackers more flexibility in adapting campaigns over time. CastleLoader payloads are distributed as portable executables containing an embedded shellcode, which then invokes the main module of the loader that, in turn, connects to the C2 server in order to fetch and execute the next-stage malware. Attacks distributing the malware have relied on the prevalent ClickFix technique on domains posing as software development libraries, videoconferencing platforms, browser update notifications, or document verification systems, ultimately tricking users into copying and executing PowerShell commands that activate the infection chain.</p>

<p>Victims are directed to the bogus domains through Google searches, at which point they are served pages containing fake error messages and CAPTCHA verification boxes developed by the threat actors, asking them to carry out a series of instructions to supposedly address the issue. Alternatively, CastleLoader leverages fake GitHub repositories mimicking legitimate tools as a distribution vector, causing users who unknowingly download them to compromise their machines with malware instead. ‚ÄúThis technique exploits developers‚Äô trust in GitHub and their tendency to run installation commands from repositories that appear reputable,‚Äù PRODAFT said. This strategic abuse of social engineering mirrors techniques used in initial access brokers (IABs), underscoring its role within a broader cybercrime supply chain.</p>

<p>PRODAFT said it has observed Hijack Loader being delivered via DeerStealer as well as CastleLoader, with the latter also propagating DeerStealer variants. This suggests the overlapping nature of these campaigns, despite them being orchestrated by different threat actors. Since May 2025, CastleLoader campaigns have leveraged seven distinct C2 servers, with over 1,634 infection attempts recorded during the time period. Analysis of its C2 infrastructure and its web-based panel‚Äîwhich is used to oversee and manage the infections ‚Äì shows that as many as 469 devices were compromised, resulting in an infection rate of 28.7%.</p>

<p>Researchers also observed elements of anti-sandboxing and obfuscation‚Äîfeatures typical in advanced loaders like SmokeLoader or IceID. Combined with PowerShell abuse, GitHub impersonation, and dynamic unpacking, CastleLoader reflects a growing trend in stealth-first malware loaders that operate as stagers in malware-as-a-service (MaaS) ecosystems. ‚ÄúCastle Loader is a new and active threat, rapidly adopted by various malicious campaigns to deploy an array of other loaders and stealers,‚Äù PRODAFT
said
. ‚ÄúIts sophisticated anti-analysis techniques and multi-stage infection process highlight its effectiveness as a primary distribution mechanism in the current threat landscape.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe C2 panel demonstrates operational capabilities typically associated with malware-as-a-service (MaaS) offerings, suggesting the operators have experience in cybercriminal infrastructure development.‚Äù

<h2 id="sophos-and-sonicwall-patch-critical-rce-flaws-affecting-firewalls-and-sma-100-devices"><a id="article-10"></a>Sophos and SonicWall Patch Critical RCE Flaws Affecting Firewalls and SMA 100 Devices</h2>

<p>Sophos and SonicWall have alerted users of critical security flaws in Sophos Firewall and Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 100 Series appliances that could be exploited to achieve remote code execution. The two vulnerabilities
impacting
Sophos Firewall are listed below -
CVE-2025-6704
(CVSS score: 9.8) - An arbitrary file writing vulnerability in the Secure PDF eXchange (SPX) feature can lead to pre-auth remote code execution, if a specific configuration of SPX is enabled in combination with the firewall running in High Availability (HA) mode
CVE-2025-7624
(CVSS score: 9.8) - An SQL injection vulnerability in the legacy (transparent) SMTP proxy can lead to remote code execution, if a quarantining policy is active for Email and SFOS was upgraded from a version older than 21.0 GA
Sophos said CVE-2025-6704 affects about 0.05% of devices, while CVE-2025-7624 impacts as many as 0.73% of devices. Both vulnerabilities have been addressed alongside a high-severity command injection vulnerability in the WebAdmin component (
CVE-2025-7382
, CVSS score: 8.8) that could result in pre-auth code execution on High Availability (HA) auxiliary devices, if OTP authentication for the admin user is enabled. Also patched by the company are two other vulnerabilities -
CVE-2024-13974
(CVSS score: 8.1) - A business logic vulnerability in the Up2Date component can lead to attackers controlling the firewall‚Äôs DNS environment to achieve remote code execution
CVE-2024-13973
(CVSS score: 6.8) - A post-auth SQL injection vulnerability in WebAdmin can potentially lead to administrators achieving arbitrary code execution
The U.K.</p>

<p>National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has been credited with discovering and reporting both CVE-2024-13974 and CVE-2024-13973. The issues affect the following versions -
CVE-2024-13974 - Affects Sophos Firewall v21.0 GA (21.0.0) and older
CVE-2024-13973 - Affects Sophos Firewall v21.0 GA (21.0.0) and older
CVE-2025-6704 - Affects Sophos Firewall v21.5 GA (21.5.0) and older
CVE-2025-7624 - Affects Sophos Firewall v21.5 GA (21.5.0) and older
CVE-2025-7382 - Affects Sophos Firewall v21.5 GA (21.5.0) and older
The disclosure comes as SonicWall
detailed
a critical bug in the SMA 100 Series web management interface (CVE-2025-40599, CVSS score: 9.1) that a remote attacker with administrative privileges can exploit to upload arbitrary files and potentially achieve remote code execution. The flaw impacts SMA 100 Series products (SMA 210, 410, 500v) and has been addressed in version 10.2.2.1-90sv. SonicWall also pointed out that while the vulnerability has not been exploited, there exists a potential risk in light of a
recent report
from the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG), which found evidence of a threat actor dubbed UNC6148 leveraging fully-patched SMA 100 series devices to deploy a backdoor called
OVERSTEP
.</p>

<p>Besides applying the fixes, the company is also recommending that customers of SMA 100 Series devices carry out the following steps -
Disable remote management access on the external-facing interface (X1) to reduce the attack surface
Reset all passwords and reinitialize OTP (One-Time Password) binding for users and administrators on the appliance
Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users
Enable Web Application Firewall (WAF) on SMA 100
Organizations using SMA 100 Series devices are also advised to review appliance logs and connection history for anomalies and check for any signs of unauthorized access. Organizations using the SMA 500v virtual product are required to backup the OVA file, export the configuration, remove the existing virtual machine and all associated virtual disks and snapshots, reinstall the new OVA from SonicWall using a hypervisor, and restore the configuration.

<h2 id="pentests-once-a-year-nope-its-time-to-build-an-offensive-soc"><a id="article-12"></a>Pentests once a year? Nope. It‚Äôs time to build an offensive SOC</h2>

<p>You wouldn‚Äôt run your blue team once a year, so why accept this substandard schedule for your offensive side? Your cybersecurity teams are under intense pressure to be proactive and to find your network‚Äôs weaknesses before adversaries do. But in many organizations, offensive security is still treated as a one-time event: an annual pentest, a quarterly red team engagement,
maybe an audit sprint before a compliance deadline
. That‚Äôs not defense.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a theater. In the real world,
adversaries don‚Äôt operate in bursts. Their recon is continuous, their tools and tactics are always evolving, and new vulnerabilities are often reverse-engineered into working exploits within hours of a patch release. So, if your offensive validation isn‚Äôt just as dynamic,
you‚Äôre not just lagging, you‚Äôre exposed.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs time to move
beyond the once a year pentest. It‚Äôs time to build an
Offensive Security Operations Center
. Why annual pentesting falls short
Point-in-time penetration tests still serve a role, and are here to remain a compliance requirement. But they fall short in environments that change faster than they can be assessed.</p>

<p>This is true for a number of reasons:
The scope is limited. Most enterprise pentests are scoped to avoid business disruption, but we all know that attackers don‚Äôt care about your scope, or unless they‚Äôre in stealth mode, disrupting your business. Controls decay silently. Drift is constant.</p>

<p>An EDR policy gets loosened. A SIEM rule breaks. And annual pentests are not built to catch these problems. The security control that ‚Äúpassed‚Äù in the test may very well fail when it really matters, two weeks later.</p>

<p>Access escalates quietly. In Active Directory environments, misconfigurations accumulate silently over time, nested groups, stale accounts, over-privileged service identities, and well-known privilege escalation paths are commonplace. These aren‚Äôt just theoretical risks; they‚Äôve been actively leveraged for decades. Attackers don‚Äôt need zero-days to succeed.</p>

<p>They rely on weak trust relationships, configuration drift, and a lack of visibility. Timing lags. By the time a pentest report is delivered, your environment has already changed. You‚Äôre chasing what
was
, not what
is
.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs like looking at last month‚Äôs video from your door camera to see what‚Äôs happening today. However, this is not a call to abolish pentesting. Quite the opposite, manual pentests bring human creativity, contextual awareness, and adversarial thinking that no automation can replicate. But relying on them alone, especially when performed only once or twice a year, limits their impact.</p>

<p>By building an Offensive SOC and operationalizing continuous validation, organizations enable pentesters to focus on what they do best:
uncover edge cases
,
bypass defenses creatively
, and
explore complex scenarios
beyond the reach of automation. In short: an Offensive SOC doesn‚Äôt replace pentesting, it gives it room to evolve. Without continuous validation, a security posture becomes a snapshot, not a source of truth. From point-in-time defense to persistent offense
The
Offensive Security Operations Center (Offensive SOC)
flips the model from a one-off pentest as part of a decidedly defensive SOC to a team continuously out-maneuvering adversaries by thinking and acting like an attacker, every single day.</p>

<p>Instead of waiting for trouble to respond to, the Offensive SOC is collaborative, transparent, and built to uncover tangible risks and drive actual fixes, in real time. Think of it this way: If a traditional SOC raises alerts on attacks that
reach
you, the Offensive SOC raises alerts on vulnerabilities that
could
. And the tools that power it? It‚Äôs time to toss your outdated clipboards, and checklists, and power up
Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS)
and
Automated Penetration Testing
solutions.</p>

<p>The core pillars of the offensive SOC</p>
<ol>
  <li>Continuously discovering what‚Äôs exposed
You can‚Äôt validate what you haven‚Äôt found. Your organization‚Äôs attack surface is rife with sprawling with cloud workloads, unmanaged assets, shadow IT, stale DNS records, and public S3 buckets. It‚Äôs time to accept that periodic scans just don‚Äôt cut it anymore.</li>
</ol>

<p>Discovery must be persistent and continuous, just like an attacker would do. 2. Real-world attack simulation with BAS
Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS)
doesn‚Äôt guess. It simulates real-world TTPs mapped to industry-recognized frameworks like
MITRE ATT&amp;CK¬Æ
across the kill chain.</p>

<p>BAS answers a series of practical yet high-stakes questions:
Can your SIEM catch a credential dumping attack? Will your EDR block known ransomware? Does your WAF stop critical web attacks like Citrix Bleed or IngressNightmare? BAS is about controlled, safe, production-aware testing and executing the same techniques attackers use, against your actual controls without actually putting your data, bottom line, and reputation at risk.</p>

<p>BAS will show you exactly what works, what fails, and where to best focus your efforts. 3. Exploit Chain Testing with Automated Pentesting
Sometimes individual vulnerabilities may not be harmful on their own. However, adversaries carefully chain multiple vulnerabilities and misconfigurations together to achieve their objectives.</p>

<p>With
Automated Penetration Testing
, security teams can validate how a real compromise could unfold, step by step, end to end. Automated Pentesting simulates an assumed breach from a domain-joined system, starting with access to a low-privileged or system-level user. From this foothold, it discovers and validates the shortest, stealthiest attack paths to critical assets, such as domain admin privileges, by chaining real techniques like credential theft, lateral movement, and privilege escalation. Here‚Äôs an example:
Initial access to an HR workstation exposes a Kerberoasting opportunity, triggered by misconfigured service account permissions.</p>

<p>Offline password cracking reveals plaintext credentials. Those credentials enable lateral movement to another machine. Eventually, the simulation captures a domain admin‚Äôs NTLM hash, with no alerts triggered and no controls intervening. This is just one scenario among thousands, but it mirrors the real tactics adversaries use to escalate their privileges
inside your network
.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Drift Detection and Posture Tracking
Security isn‚Äôt static. Rules change. Configurations shift.</li>
</ol>

<p>Controls fail quietly. The Offensive SOC keeps score over time. It tracks when your prevention and detection layer solutions start to slip, like:
An EDR policy update that disables known malware signatures
A SIEM alert that quietly stops firing after a rule modification
A firewall rule that‚Äôs altered during maintenance, leaving a port exposed
The Offensive SOC doesn‚Äôt just tell you what failed, it tells you when it started failing. And this is how you stay ahead: not by reacting to alerts, but by catching your vulnerabilities before they‚Äôre exploited.</p>

<p>Where Picus fits in
Picus helps security teams operationalize the
Offensive SOC
, with a unified platform that continuously validates exposures across prevention, detection, and response layers. We combine:
BAS to test how your controls respond to real-world threats. Automated penetration testing to simulate attacker movement post-access, and identify high-risk paths. Known threat and mitigation libraries to simulate attacks and close gaps faster.</p>

<p>Seamless integration with your existing SOC stack. And Picus isn‚Äôt just making promises. The Blue Report 2024
found that:
Organizations using Picus
reduced critical vulnerabilities by over 50%
. Customers
doubled their prevention effectiveness
in 90 days.</p>

<p>Teams
mitigated security gaps 81% faster using Picus
. With Picus, you can boldly move beyond assumptions and make decisions backed by validation. That‚Äôs the value of an Offensive SOC: focused, efficient, and continuous security improvement. Final thought: Validation isn‚Äôt a report, it‚Äôs a practice
Building an
Offensive SOC
isn‚Äôt about adding more dashboards, solutions, or noise; it‚Äôs about turning your reactive security operations center into a
continuous validation engine.</p>

<p>It means proving what‚Äôs exploitable, what‚Äôs protected, and what needs attention. Picus helps your security teams do exactly that, operationalizing validation across your entire stack. Ready to explore the details? Download

<h2 id="china-based-apts-deploy-fake-dalai-lama-apps-to-spy-on-tibetan-community"><a id="article-13"></a>China-Based APTs Deploy Fake Dalai Lama Apps to Spy on Tibetan Community</h2>

<p>The Tibetan community has been targeted by a China-nexus cyber espionage group as part of two campaigns conducted last month ahead of the Dalai Lama‚Äôs 90th birthday on July 6, 2025. The multi-stage attacks have been codenamed
Operation GhostChat
and
Operation PhantomPrayers
by Zscaler ThreatLabz. ‚ÄúThe attackers compromised a legitimate website, redirecting users via a malicious link and ultimately installing either the Gh0st RAT or PhantomNet (aka SManager) backdoor onto victim systems,‚Äù security researchers Sudeep Singh and Roy Tay
said
in a Wednesday report. This is not the first time Chinese threat actors have resorted to watering hole attacks (aka strategic web compromises), a technique where adversaries break into websites frequently visited by a specific group to infect their devices with malware.</p>

<p>Over the past two years, hacking groups like
EvilBamboo
,
Evasive Panda
, and
TAG-112
have all resorted to the approach to target the Tibetan diaspora with the ultimate goal of gathering sensitive information. Operation GhostChat
The latest set of attacks observed by Zscaler entails the compromise of a web page to replace the link pointing to ‚Äútibetfund[.]org/90thbirthday‚Äù with a fraudulent version (‚Äúthedalailama90.niccenter[.]net‚Äù). While the original web page is designed to send a message to the Dalai Lama, the replica page adds an option to send an encrypted message to the spiritual leader by downloading from ‚Äútbelement.niccenter[.]net‚Äù a secure chat application named TElement, which claims to be Tibetan version of
Element
. Hosted on the website is a backdoored version of the open-source encrypted chat software containing a malicious DLL that‚Äôs sideloaded to launch
Gh0st RAT
, a remote access trojan widely used by various Chinese hacking groups.</p>

<p>The web page also includes JavaScript code designed to collect the visitor‚Äôs IP address and user-agent information, and exfiltrate the details to the threat actor via an HTTP POST request. Operation PhantomPrayers
Gh0st RAT is a fully-featured malware that supports file manipulation, screen capture, clipboard content extraction, webcam video recording, keylogging, audio recording and playback, process manipulation, and remote shell. The second campaign, Operation PhantomPrayers, has been found to leverage another domain, ‚Äúhhthedalailama90.niccenter[.]net,‚Äù to distribute a phony ‚Äú90th Birthday Global Check-in‚Äù app (‚ÄúDalaiLamaCheckin.exe,‚Äù dubbed PhantomPrayers) that, when opened, displays an interactive map and urges victims to ‚Äúsend your blessings‚Äù for the Dalai Lama by tapping their location on the map. However, the malicious functionality is stealthily triggered in the background, using DLL side-loading techniques to launch
PhantomNet
, a backdoor that establishes contact with a command-and-control (C2) server over TCP to receive additional plugin DLLs for execution on the compromised machine.</p>

<p>‚ÄúPhantomNet can be set to operate only during specific hours or days, but this capability is not enabled in the current sample,‚Äù the researchers said. ‚ÄúPhantomNet used modular plugin DLLs, AES-encrypted C2 traffic, and configurable timed operations, to stealthily manage compromised systems.‚Äù
