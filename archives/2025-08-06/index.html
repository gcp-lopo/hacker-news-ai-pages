<h2 id="clickfix-malware-campaign-exploits-captchas-to-spread-cross-platform-infections"><a id="article-1"></a>ClickFix Malware Campaign Exploits CAPTCHAs to Spread Cross-Platform Infections</h2>

<p>A combination of propagation methods, narrative sophistication, and evasion techniques enabled the social engineering tactic known as
ClickFix
to take off the way it did over the past year, according to new findings from Guardio Labs. ‚ÄúLike a real-world virus variant, this new ‚Äò
ClickFix
‚Äò strain quickly outpaced and ultimately wiped out the infamous fake browser update scam that plagued the web just last year,‚Äù security researcher Shaked Chen
said
in a report shared with The Hacker News. ‚ÄúIt did so by removing the need for file downloads, using smarter social engineering tactics, and spreading through trusted infrastructure. The result - a wave of infections ranging from mass drive-by attacks to hyper-targeted spear-phishing lures.‚Äù
ClickFix
is the name given to a social engineering tactic where prospective targets are deceived into infecting their own machines under the guise of fixing a non-existent issue or a CAPTCHA verification.</p>

<p>It was first detected in the wild in early 2024. In these attacks, infection vectors as diverse as phishing emails, drive-by downloads, malvertising, and search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning are employed to direct users to fake pages that display the error messages. These messages have one goal: Guide victims to follow a series of steps that cause a covertly copied malicious command to their clipboard to be executed when pasted on the Windows Run dialog box or the Terminal app, in the case of
Apple macOS
. The nefarious command, in turn, triggers the execution of a multi-stage sequence that results in the deployment of various kinds of malware, such as stealers, remote access trojans, and loaders, underscoring the flexibility of the threat.</p>

<p>The tactic has
become
so
effective
and potent that it has led to what Guardio calls a CAPTCHAgeddon, with both cybercriminal and nation-state actors wielding it in
dozens of campaigns
in a short span of time. ClickFix is a more stealthy mutation of
ClearFake
, which involves leveraging compromised WordPress sites to serve fake browser update pop-ups that, in turn, deliver stealer malware. ClearFake subsequently went on to incorporate advanced evasion tactics like
EtherHiding
to conceal the next-stage payload using Binance‚Äôs Smart Chain (BSC) contracts. Guardio said the evolution of ClickFix and its success is the result of constant refinement in terms of propagation vectors, the diversification of the lures and messaging, and the different methods used to get ahead of the detection curve, so much so that it ultimately supplanted ClearFake.</p>

<p>‚ÄúEarly prompts were generic, but they quickly became more persuasive, adding urgency or suspicion cues,‚Äù Chen said. ‚ÄúThese tweaks increased compliance rates by exploiting basic psychological pressure.‚Äù
Some of the notable ways the attack approach has adapted include the abuse of Google Scripts to host the fake CAPTCHA flows, thereby leveraging the trust associated with Google‚Äôs domain, as well as embedding the payload within legitimate-looking file sources like socket.io.min.js. ‚ÄúThis chilling list of techniques ‚Äì obfuscation, dynamic loading, legitimate-looking files, cross-platform handling, third-party payload delivery, and abuse of trusted hosts like Google ‚Äì demonstrates how threat actors have continuously adapted to avoid detection,‚Äù Chen added. ‚ÄúIt is a stark reminder that these attackers are not just refining their phishing lures or social engineering tactics but are investing heavily in technical methods to ensure their attacks remain effective and resilient against security measures.‚Äù

<h2 id="googles-august-patch-fixes-two-qualcomm-vulnerabilities-exploited-in-the-wild"><a id="article-2"></a>Google‚Äôs August Patch Fixes Two Qualcomm Vulnerabilities Exploited in the Wild</h2>

<p>Google has
released
security updates to address multiple security flaws in Android, including fixes for two Qualcomm bugs that were flagged as actively exploited in the wild. The vulnerabilities include CVE-2025-21479 (CVSS score: 8.6) and CVE-2025-27038 (CVSS score: 7.5), both of which were
disclosed
alongside CVE-2025-21480 (CVSS score: 8.6), by the chipmaker back in June 2025. CVE-2025-21479 relates to an incorrect authorization vulnerability in the Graphics component that could lead to memory corruption due to unauthorized command execution in GPU microcode. CVE-2025-27038, on the other hand, use-after-free vulnerability in the Graphics component that could result in memory corruption while rendering graphics using Adreno GPU drivers in Chrome.</p>

<p>There are still no details on how these shortcomings have been weaponized in real-world attacks, but Qualcomm noted at the time that ‚Äúthere are indications from Google Threat Analysis Group that CVE-2025-21479, CVE-2025-21480, CVE-2025-27038 may be under limited, targeted exploitation.‚Äù
Given that similar flaws in Qualcomm chipsets have been exploited by commercial spyware vendors like Variston and Cy4Gate in the past, it‚Äôs suspected that the aforementioned shortcomings may also have been abused in a similar context. The three vulnerabilities have since been
added
to the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency‚Äôs (CISA) Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (
KEV
) catalog, requiring federal agencies to apply the updates by June 24, 2025. Google‚Äôs August 2025 patch also resolves two high-severity privilege escalation flaws in Android Framework (CVE-2025-22441 and CVE-2025-48533) and a critical bug in the System component (CVE-2025-48530) that could result in remote code execution when combined with other flaws without requiring any additional privileges or user interaction.</p>

<p>The tech giant has made available two patch levels, 2025-08-01 and 2025-08-05, with the latter also incorporating fixes for closed-source and third-party components from Arm and Qualcomm. Android device users are advised to apply the updates as and when they become available to stay protected against potential threats. Found this article interesting? Follow us on

<h2 id="cursor-ai-code-editor-vulnerability-enables-rce-via-malicious-mcp-file-swaps-post-approval"><a id="article-3"></a>Cursor AI Code Editor Vulnerability Enables RCE via Malicious MCP File Swaps Post Approval</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a high-severity security flaw in the artificial intelligence (AI)-powered code editor Cursor that could result in remote code execution. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-54136 (CVSS score: 7.2), has been codenamed
MCPoison
by Check Point Research, owing to the fact that it exploits a quirk in the way the software handles modifications to Model Context Protocol (MCP) server configurations. ‚ÄúA vulnerability in Cursor AI allows an attacker to achieve remote and persistent code execution by modifying an already trusted MCP configuration file inside a shared GitHub repository or editing the file locally on the target‚Äôs machine,‚Äù Cursor
said
in an advisory released last week. ‚ÄúOnce a collaborator accepts a harmless MCP, the attacker can silently swap it for a malicious command (e.g., calc.exe) without triggering any warning or re-prompt.‚Äù
MCP is an open-standard developed by Anthropic that allows large language models (LLMs) to interact with external tools, data, and services in a standardized manner.</p>

<p>It was introduced by the AI company in November 2024. CVE-2025-54136, per Check Point, has to do with how it‚Äôs possible for an attacker to alter the behavior of an MCP configuration after a user has approved it within Cursor. Specifically, it unfolds as follows -
Add a benign-looking MCP configuration (‚Äú.cursor/rules/mcp.json‚Äù) to a shared repository
Wait for the victim to pull the code and approve it once in Cursor
Replace the MCP configuration with a malicious payload, e.g., launch a script or run a backdoor
Achieve persistent code execution every time the victim opens the Cursor
The fundamental problem here is that once a configuration is approved, it‚Äôs trusted by Cursor indefinitely for future runs, even if it has been changed. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability not only exposes organizations to supply chain risks, but also opens the door to data and intellectual property theft without their knowledge.</p>

<p>Following responsible disclosure on July 16, 2025, the issue has been addressed by Cursor in version 1.3 released late July 2025 by requiring user approval every time an entry in the MCP configuration file is modified. ‚ÄúThe flaw exposes a critical weakness in the trust model behind AI-assisted development environments, raising the stakes for teams integrating LLMs and automation into their workflows,‚Äù
Check Point
said. The development comes days after Aim Labs, Backslash Security, and HiddenLayer
exposed
multiple weaknesses in the AI tool that could have been abused to obtain remote code execution and bypass its denylist-based protections. They have also been patched in version 1.3.</p>

<p>The findings also coincide with the growing adoption of AI in business workflows, including using LLMs for code generation, broadening the attack surface to
various emerging risks
like AI supply chain attacks, unsafe code, model poisoning, prompt injection, hallucinations, inappropriate responses, and data leakage -
A test of over 100 LLMs for their ability to write Java, Python, C#, and JavaScript code has
found
that 45% of the generated code samples failed security tests and introduced OWASP Top 10 security vulnerabilities. Java led with a 72% security failure rate, followed by C# (45%), JavaScript (43%), and Python (38%). An attack called
LegalPwn
has revealed that it‚Äôs possible to leverage legal disclaimers, terms of service, or privacy policies as a novel prompt injection vector, highlighting how malicious instructions can be embedded within legitimate, but often overlooked, textual components to trigger unintended behavior in LLMs, such as misclassifying malicious code as safe and offering unsafe code suggestions that can execute a reverse shell on the developer‚Äôs system. An attack called
man-in-the-prompt
that employs a rogue browser extension with no special permissions to open a new browser tab in the background, launch an AI chatbot, and inject them with malicious prompts to covertly extract data and compromise model integrity.</p>

<p>This takes advantage of the fact that any browser add-on with scripting access to the Document Object Model (DOM) can read from, or write to, the AI prompt directly. A jailbreak technique called
Fallacy Failure
that manipulates an LLM into accepting logically invalid premises and causes it to produce otherwise restricted outputs, thereby deceiving the model into breaking its own rules. An attack called
MAS hijacking
that manipulates the control flow of a multi-agent system (MAS) to execute arbitrary malicious code across domains, mediums, and topologies by weaponizing the agentic nature of AI systems. A technique called
Poisoned GPT-Generated Unified Format (GGUF) Templates
that targets the AI model inference pipeline by embedding malicious instructions within the
chat template files
that execute during the inference phase to compromise outputs.</p>

<p>By positioning the attack between input validation and model output, the approach is both sneaky and bypasses AI guardrails. With GGUF files distributed via services like Hugging Face, the attack exploits the supply chain trust model to trigger the attack. An attacker can
target
the machine learning (ML) training environments like MLFlow, Amazon SageMaker, and Azure ML to compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the models, ultimately leading to lateral movement, privilege escalation, as well as training data and model theft and poisoning. A study by Anthropic has uncovered that LLMs can learn hidden characteristics during distillation, a phenomenon called
subliminal learning
, that causes models to transmit behavioral traits through generated data that appears completely unrelated to those traits, potentially leading to misalignment and harmful behavior.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAs Large Language Models become deeply embedded in agent workflows, enterprise copilots, and developer tools, the risk posed by these jailbreaks escalates significantly,‚Äù Pillar Security‚Äôs Dor Sarig said. ‚ÄúModern jailbreaks can propagate through contextual chains, infecting one AI component and leading to cascading logic failures across interconnected systems.‚Äù
‚ÄúThese attacks highlight that AI security requires a new paradigm, as they bypass traditional safeguards without relying on architectural flaws or CVEs. The vulnerability lies in the very language and reasoning the model is designed to emulate.‚Äù

<h2 id="misconfigurations-are-not-vulnerabilities-the-costly-confusion-behind-security-risks"><a id="article-5"></a>Misconfigurations Are Not Vulnerabilities: The Costly Confusion Behind Security Risks</h2>

<p>In SaaS security conversations, ‚Äúmisconfiguration‚Äù and ‚Äúvulnerability‚Äù are often used interchangeably. But they‚Äôre not the same thing. And misunderstanding that distinction can quietly create real exposure. This confusion isn‚Äôt just semantics.</p>

<p>It reflects a deeper misunderstanding of the shared responsibility model, particularly in SaaS environments where the line between vendor and customer responsibility is often unclear. A Quick Breakdown
Vulnerabilities
are flaws in the codebase of the SaaS platform itself. These are issues only the vendor can patch. Think zero-days and code-level exploits.</p>

<p>Misconfigurations
, on the other hand, are user-controlled. They result from how the platform is set up‚Äîwho has access, what integrations are connected, and what policies are enforced (or not). A misconfiguration might look like a third-party app with excessive access, or a sensitive internal site that is accidentally public. A Shared Model, but Split Responsibilities
Most SaaS providers operate under a shared responsibility model.</p>

<p>They secure the infrastructure, deliver commitments on uptime, and provide platform-level protections. In SaaS, this model means the vendor handles the underlying hosting infrastructure and systems, while customers are responsible for how they configure the application, manage access, and control data sharing. It‚Äôs up to the customer to configure and use the application securely. This includes identity management, permissions, data sharing policies, and third-party integrations.</p>

<p>These are not optional layers of security. They‚Äôre foundational. That disconnect is reflected in the data: 53% of organizations say their SaaS security confidence is based on trust in the vendor, according to the
The State of SaaS Security 2025 Report
. In reality, assuming vendors are handling everything can create a dangerous blind spot, especially when the customer controls the most breach-prone settings.</p>

<p>Threat Detection Can‚Äôt Catch What Was Never Logged
Most incidents don‚Äôt involve advanced attacks, or even a threat actor triggering an alert. Instead, they originate from configuration or policy issues that go unnoticed. The State of SaaS Security 2025 Report
identifies that 41% of incidents were caused by permission issues and 29% by misconfigurations. These risks don‚Äôt appear in traditional detection tools (including SaaS threat detection platforms) because they‚Äôre not triggered by user behavior.</p>

<p>Instead, they‚Äôre baked into how the system is set up. You only see them by analyzing configurations, permissions, and integration settings directly‚Äînot through logs or alerts. Here‚Äôs what a typical SaaS attack path looks like‚Äîstarting with access attempts and ending in data exfiltration. Each step can be blocked by either posture controls (prevent) or detected through anomaly and event-driven alerts (detect).</p>

<p>But not every risk shows up in a log file. Some can only be addressed by hardening your environment before the attack even begins. Logs capture actions like logins, file access, or administrative changes. But excessive permissions, unsecured third-party connections, or overexposed data aren‚Äôt actions.</p>

<p>They are conditions. If no one interacts with them, they leave no trace in the log files. This gap is not just theoretical. Research into Salesforce‚Äôs OmniStudio platform
(designed for low-code customization in regulated industries like healthcare, financial services, and government workflows) revealed critical misconfigurations that traditional monitoring tools failed to detect.</p>

<p>These weren‚Äôt obscure edge cases. They included permission models that exposed sensitive data by default and low-code components that granted broader access than intended. The risks were real, but the signals were silent. While detection remains critical for responding to active threats, it must be layered on top of a secure posture, not as a substitute for it.</p>

<p>Build a Secure-by-Design SaaS Program
The bottom line is this: you can‚Äôt detect your way out of a misconfiguration problem. If the risk lives in how the system is set up, detection won‚Äôt catch it. Posture management needs to come first. Instead of reacting to breaches, organizations should focus on preventing the conditions that cause them.</p>

<p>That starts with visibility into configurations, permissions, third-party access, shadow AI, and the risky combinations that attackers exploit. Threat detection still matters, not because posture is weak, but because no system is ever bulletproof. AppOmni helps customers combine a strong preventive posture with high-fidelity detection to create a layered defense strategy that stops known risks and catches the unknowns. A Smarter Approach to SaaS Security
To build a modern SaaS security strategy, start with what‚Äôs actually in your control.</p>

<p>Focus on securing configurations, managing access, and establishing visibility, because the best time to address SaaS risk is before it becomes a problem. Ready to fix the gaps in your SaaS posture? If you want to see where most teams are falling short‚Äîand what leading organizations are doing differently‚Äîthe
2025 State of SaaS Security Report
breaks it down. From breach drivers to gaps in ownership and confidence, it‚Äôs a revealing look at how posture continues to shape outcomes.</p>

<h2 id="how-top-cisos-save-their-socs-from-alert-chaos-to-never-miss-real-incidents"><a id="article-6"></a>How Top CISOs Save Their SOCs from Alert Chaos to Never Miss Real Incidents</h2>

<p>Why do SOC teams still drown in alerts even after spending big on security tools? False positives pile up, stealthy threats slip through, and critical incidents get buried in the noise. Top CISOs have realized the solution isn‚Äôt adding more and more tools to SOC workflows but giving analysts the speed and visibility they need to catch real attacks before they cause damage. Here‚Äôs how they‚Äôre breaking the cycle and turning their SOCs into true threat-stopping machines.</p>

<p>Starting with Live, Interactive Threat Analysis
The first step to staying ahead of attackers is seeing threats as they happen. Static scans and delayed reports just can‚Äôt keep up with modern, evasive malware. Interactive sandboxes like ANY.RUN let analysts detonate suspicious files, URLs, and QR codes in a
fully isolated, safe environment
and actually
interact with the sample in real time
. Why CISOs give access to interactive sandboxes:
Analysts can click links, open files, and mimic real user actions to trigger hidden payloads that traditional scanners miss.</p>

<p>They get full visibility into execution flow, dropped files, network connections, and related TTPs in seconds. Immediate IOC extraction means teams can respond faster and block similar threats before they spread. Check this real case of phishing attack analyzed inside ANY.RUN‚Äôs interactive sandbox. View real case of phishing attack
Full phishing attack chain analyzed inside interactive sandbox in real time
A phishing attack with a malicious QR code was fully analyzed in under one minute inside ANY.RUN.</p>

<p>Analysts were able to watch the entire attack chain unfold, collect IOCs, and map behaviors to MITRE TTPs, all without leaving the sandbox. What once took hours of manual work now takes minutes, saving the team time and helping prevent repeat attacks. Give your analysts the speed, automation, and clarity they need with the ANY.RUN sandbox, trusted by CISOs to drive faster, smarter threat response. Start your 14-day trial
Automating Triage to Speed Up Response and Reduce Workload
Modern SOCs are turning to
automation
for one simple reason: it removes the slow, repetitive tasks that hold teams back.</p>

<p>By automating triage, SOCs gain several key benefits:
Faster investigations ‚Üí faster incident response:
Automated workflows shorten the time between alert and action. Reduced human error:
Machines handle routine steps consistently, so nothing gets overlooked. Confidence for junior analysts:
Automation handles the tricky parts, so new team members can contribute without constantly relying on seniors. Focus for senior specialists:
Freed from repetitive work, they can spend time on advanced threats, hunting, or improving detection rules.</p>

<p>Higher SOC efficiency overall:
Less fatigue, more accurate findings, and faster MTTR (Mean Time to Respond). The QR code phishing attack mentioned earlier is a perfect example of how
Automated Interactivity
in ANY.RUN changes the game. In this real case, the malicious URL was buried behind a QR code and protected by a CAPTCHA. Phishing attack with QR code exposed with the help of automation, saving time and resources
Normally, an analyst would have to manually scan the code, open the link in a safe browser, pass the CAPTCHA, and then try to trigger the hidden payload; a tedious and error‚Äëprone process.</p>

<p>With
automation enabled
, the sandbox handled everything on its own: it opened the hidden URL, passed the CAPTCHA, and exposed the malicious process in seconds. Malicious URL revealed inside ANY.RUN sandbox
Analysts didn‚Äôt have to wait for the analysis to finish; they could
interact with the sample live at any stage
, clicking through processes, opening files, or triggering additional behaviors in a fully safe environment. This dual approach,
automation plus interactivity,
means your SOC saves time on tedious tasks while still giving analysts complete control. Routine steps no longer drain resources, junior staff can contribute confidently, and investigations move faster, leading to quicker containment and a stronger overall security posture.</p>

<p>Boosting SOC Performance with Collaboration and a Connected Security Stack
Even the most advanced detection tools won‚Äôt fix a slow or fragmented SOC on their own. True performance comes from collaboration;
when analysts can work together seamlessly, share findings in real time, and avoid duplicate effort. That‚Äôs why top CISOs prioritize tools and platforms that
make teamwork part of the investigation process
. For example, solutions like ANY.RUN include
built‚Äëin teamwork features
that give SOC analysts a shared workspace.</p>

<p>Tasks are clearly assigned, progress is visible to managers, and analysts, whether in the same office or spread across time zones, stay fully aligned. This level of collaboration reduces friction, keeps investigations moving, and ensures that insights don‚Äôt get lost between handoffs. Team management displayed inside ANY.RUN sandbox
But collaboration is only half the picture. High‚Äëperforming SOCs also need their tools to
fit naturally into the existing stack
.</p>

<p>The best solutions integrate with SOAR, SIEM, and XDR platforms, allowing analysts to launch sandbox analyses, enrich alerts, and automate response steps without leaving the tools they already know. This not only speeds up onboarding but also
eliminates the learning curve;
your team works faster using familiar interfaces, and your SOC levels up without adding complexity. When collaboration and integration come together, the payoff is clear:
Faster investigations and decision‚Äëmaking
Smoother workflows with fewer handoff delays
A stronger, more efficient SOC without extra overhead
Protecting Privacy and Maintaining Compliance
CISOs know that speed and visibility are only part of the equation; investigations must
stay secure
. Handling suspicious files, internal documents, or client data in a shared environment can create risks if not managed carefully.</p>

<p>Modern SOC tools solve this by offering
private, isolated analysis environments
with
role-based access controls and SSO support
. This ensures that:
Sensitive artifacts never leave the organization
Only authorized team members can access specific investigations
Compliance requirements are met without slowing down response
Solutions like ANY.RUN‚Äôs sandbox make this simple. Analysts can detonate files and URLs in fully private sessions where no data is shared externally, and results are only visible to assigned team members. Even in collaborative investigations, managers can control who sees what, while SSO ensures smooth, secure access aligned with company policies.</p>

<p>Privacy management in ANY.RUN‚Äôs team settings
What CISOs Are Reporting After Putting These Strategies to Work
After implementing the strategies outlined above, real-time threat analysis, automated triage, streamlined collaboration, and privacy-first workflows, SOCs using ANY.RUN‚Äôs interactive sandbox are reporting measurable improvements across the board. Up to 3x improvement in SOC performance
, driven by faster investigations and fewer manual steps
90% of organizations report higher detection rates
, particularly for stealthy and evasive threats
50% reduction
in malware investigation time
Improved team collaboration, with shared reports and interactive analysis reducing handoff delays
Deeper threat visibility
, including multi-stage and fileless malware
These numbers reflect real operational gains: faster responses, sharper visibility, and stronger defense. For CISOs, it means fewer missed incidents, better use of analyst time, and a SOC that‚Äôs equipped to handle whatever comes next. Equip Your SOC with the Speed It Deserves
The best SOCs don‚Äôt wait.</p>

<p>They detect threats early, respond fast, and adapt quickly to whatever attackers throw at them. But none of that happens without the right foundation. By implementing interactive analysis, automating triage, enabling collaboration, and protecting sensitive workflows, top CISOs are building SOCs that lead. ANY.RUN‚Äôs sandbox brings all of that in one place.</p>

<p>It gives your team the visibility, control, and automation they need to cut through alert chaos, reduce workload, and never miss a real incident. Trusted by CISOs to deliver:
Reduced Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)
Lower risk of business disruption and data breaches
Fewer missed incidents and false negatives
Less analyst burnout and turnover
Better ROI from your existing security stack
Ready to see the difference in your own SOC? Start your 14-day trial
and give your team the power to investigate threats in real time, with clarity, speed, and confidence. Found this article interesting?</p>

<h2 id="15000-fake-tiktok-shop-domains-deliver-malware-steal-crypto-via-ai-driven-scam-campaign"><a id="article-7"></a>15,000 Fake TikTok Shop Domains Deliver Malware, Steal Crypto via AI-Driven Scam Campaign</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have lifted the veil on a widespread malicious campaign that‚Äôs targeting TikTok Shop users globally with an aim to steal credentials and distribute trojanized apps. ‚ÄúThreat actors are exploiting the official in-app e-commerce platform through a dual attack strategy that combines phishing and malware to target users,‚Äù CTM360
said
. ‚ÄúThe core tactic involves a deceptive replica of TikTok Shop that tricks users into thinking they ºre interacting with a legitimate affiliate or the real platform.‚Äù
The scam campaign has been codenamed
FraudOnTok
by the Bahrain-based cybersecurity company, calling out the threat actor‚Äôs multi-pronged distribution strategy that involves Meta ads and artificial intelligence (AI)-generated TikTok videos that mimic influencers or official brand ambassadors. Central to the effort is the use of lookalike domains that resemble legitimate TikTok URLs.</p>

<p>Over 15,000 such impersonated websites have been identified to date. The vast majority of these domains are hosted on top-level domains such as .top, .shop, and .icu. These domains are designed to host phishing landing pages that either steal user credentials or distribute bogus apps that deploy a variant of a known cross-platform malware called
SparkKitty
that‚Äôs capable of
harvesting data
from both Android and iOS devices. What‚Äôs more, a chunk of these phishing pages lure users into depositing cryptocurrency on fraudulent storefronts by advertising fake product listings and heavy discounts.</p>

<p>CTM360 said it identified no less than 5,000 URLs that are set up with an intent to download the malware-laced app by advertising it as TikTok Shop. ‚ÄúThe scam mimics legitimate TikTok Shop activity through fake ads, profiles, and AI-generated content, tricking users into engaging to distribute malware,‚Äù the company noted. ‚ÄúFake ads are widely circulated on Facebook and TikTok, featuring AI-generated videos that mimic real promotions to attract users with heavily discounted offers.‚Äù
The fraudulent scheme operates with three motives in mind, although the end goal is financial gain, regardless of the illicit monetization strategy employed:
Deceiving buyers and affiliate program sellers (creators who promote products in exchange for a commission on sales generated through the affiliate links) with bogus and discounted products and asking them to make payments in cryptocurrency
Convincing affiliate participants to ‚Äútop up‚Äù fake on-site wallets with cryptocurrency, under the promise of future commission payouts or withdrawal bonuses that never materialize
Using fake TikTok Shop login pages to steal user credentials or instruct them to download trojanized TikTok apps
The malicious app, once installed, prompts the victim to enter their credentials using their email-based account, only for it to repeatedly fail in a deliberate attempt on the part of the threat actors to present them with an alternative login using their Google account. This approach is likely meant to bypass traditional authentication flows and weaponize the session token created using the OAuth-based method for unauthorized access without requiring in-app email validation.</p>

<p>Should the logged-in victim attempt to access the TikTok Shop section, they are directed to a fake login page that asks for their credentials. Also embedded within the app is SparkKitty, a malware that‚Äôs capable of device fingerprinting and using optical character recognition (OCR) techniques to analyze screenshots in a user‚Äôs photo gallery for cryptocurrency wallet seed phrases, and exfiltrating them to an attacker-controlled server. The disclosure comes as the company also detailed another targeting phishing campaign dubbed CyberHeist Phish that‚Äôs using Google Ads and thousands of phishing links to dupe victims searching for corporate online banking sites to be redirected to seemingly benign pages that mimic the targeted banking login portal and are crafted to steal their credentials. ‚ÄúThis phishing operation is particularly sophisticated due to its evasive, selective nature and the threat actors‚Äô real-time interaction with the target to collect two-factor authentication on each stage of login, beneficiary creation and fund transfer,‚Äù CTM360
said
.</p>

<p>In recent months, phishing campaigns have also targeted Meta Business Suite users as part of a campaign called Meta Mirage that uses fake policy violation email alerts, ad account restriction notices, and deceptive verification requests distributed via email and direct messages to lead victims to credential and cookie harvesting pages are hosted on Vercel, GitHub Pages, Netlify, and Firebase. ‚ÄúThis campaign focuses on compromising high-value business assets, including ad accounts, verified brand pages, and administrator-level access within the platform,‚Äù the company
added
. These developments coincide with an advisory from the U.S. Department of the Treasury‚Äôs Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), urging financial institutions to be vigilant in identifying and reporting suspicious activity involving convertible virtual currency (CVC) kiosks in a bid to combat fraud and other illicit activities.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCriminals are relentless in their efforts to steal money from victims, and they‚Äôve learned to exploit innovative technologies like CVC kiosks,‚Äù
said
FinCEN Director Andrea Gacki. ‚ÄúThe United States is committed to safeguarding the digital asset ecosystem for legitimate businesses and consumers, and financial institutions are a critical partner in that effort.‚Äù

<h2 id="sonicwall-investigating-potential-ssl-vpn-zero-day-after-20-targeted-attacks-reported"><a id="article-8"></a>SonicWall Investigating Potential SSL VPN Zero-Day After 20+ Targeted Attacks Reported</h2>

<p>SonicWall said it‚Äôs actively investigating reports to determine if there is a new zero-day vulnerability following reports of a spike in Akira ransomware actors in late July 2025. ‚ÄúOver the past 72 hours, there has been a notable increase in both internally and externally reported cyber incidents involving Gen 7 SonicWall firewalls where SSLVPN is enabled,‚Äù the network security vendor
said
in a statement. ‚ÄúWe are actively investigating these incidents to determine whether they are connected to a previously disclosed vulnerability or if a new vulnerability may be responsible.‚Äù
While SonicWall is digging deeper, organizations using Gen 7 SonicWall firewalls are advised to follow the steps below until further notice -
Disable SSL VPN services where practical
Limit SSL VPN connectivity to trusted IP addresses
Activate services such as Botnet Protection and Geo-IP Filtering
Enforce multi-factor authentication
Remove inactive or unused local user accounts on the firewall, particularly those with SSL VPN access
Encourage regular password updates across all user accounts
The development comes shortly after Arctic Wolf
revealed
it had identified a surge in Akira ransomware activity targeting SonicWall SSL VPN devices for initial access since late last month. Huntress, in a follow-up analysis published Monday, also said it has observed threat actors pivoting directly to domain controllers merely a few hours after the initial breach.</p>

<p>Attack chains commence with the breach of the SonicWall appliance, followed by the attackers taking a ‚Äúwell-worn‚Äù post-exploitation path to conduct enumeration, detection evasion, lateral movement, and credential theft. The incidents also involve the bad actors methodically disabling Microsoft Defender Antivirus and deleting volume shadow copies prior to deploying Akira ransomware. Huntress said it detected around 20 different attacks tied to the latest attack wave starting on July 25, 2025, with variations observed in the tradecraft used to pull them off, including in the use of tools for reconnaissance and persistence, such as AnyDesk, ScreenConnect, or SSH. There is evidence to suggest that the activity may be limited to TZ and NSa-series SonicWall firewalls with SSL VPN enabled, and that the suspected flaw exists in firmware versions 7.2.0-7015 and earlier.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe speed and success of these attacks, even against environments with MFA enabled, strongly suggest a zero-day vulnerability is being exploited in the wild,‚Äù the cybersecurity company
said
. ‚ÄúThis is a critical, ongoing threat.‚Äù

<h2 id="nvidia-triton-bugs-let-unauthenticated-attackers-execute-code-and-hijack-ai-servers"><a id="article-9"></a>NVIDIA Triton Bugs Let Unauthenticated Attackers Execute Code and Hijack AI Servers</h2>

<p>A newly disclosed set of security flaws in
NVIDIA‚Äôs Triton Inference Server
for Windows and Linux, an open-source platform for running artificial intelligence (AI) models at scale, could be exploited to take over susceptible servers. ‚ÄúWhen chained together, these flaws can potentially allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to gain complete control of the server, achieving remote code execution (RCE),‚Äù Wiz researchers Ronen Shustin and Nir Ohfeld
said
in a report published today. The
vulnerabilities
are listed below -
CVE-2025-23319
(CVSS score: 8.1) - A vulnerability in the Python backend, where an attacker could cause an out-of-bounds write by sending a request
CVE-2025-23320
(CVSS score: 7.5) - A vulnerability in the Python backend, where an attacker could cause the shared memory limit to be exceeded by sending a very large request
CVE-2025-23334
(CVSS score: 5.9) - A vulnerability in the Python backend, where an attacker could cause an out-of-bounds read by sending a request
Successful exploitation of the aforementioned vulnerabilities could result in information disclosure, as well as remote code execution, denial of service, data tampering in the case of CVE-2025-23319. The issues have been addressed in version 25.07.</p>

<p>The cloud security company said the three shortcomings could be combined together that transforms the problem from an information leak to a full system compromise without requiring any credentials. Specifically, the problems are rooted in the Python backend that‚Äôs designed to handle inference requests for Python models from any major AI frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. In the attack outlined by Wiz, a threat actor could exploit CVE-2025-23320 to leak the full, unique name of the backend‚Äôs internal IPC shared memory region, a key that should have remained private, and then leverage the remaining two flaws to gain full control of the inference server. ‚ÄúThis poses a critical risk to organizations using Triton for AI/ML, as a successful attack could lead to the theft of valuable AI models, exposure of sensitive data, manipulating the AI model‚Äôs responses, and a foothold for attackers to move deeper into a network,‚Äù the researchers said.</p>

<p>NVIDIA‚Äôs August bulletin for Triton Inference Server also highlights fixes for three critical bugs (CVE-2025-23310, CVE-2025-23311, and CVE-2025-23317) that, if successfully exploited, could result in remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, and data tampering. While there is no evidence that any of these vulnerabilities have been exploited in the wild, users are advised to apply the latest updates for optimal protection. Found this article interesting?

<h2 id="vietnamese-hackers-use-pxa-stealer-hit-4000-ips-and-steal-200000-passwords-globally"><a id="article-10"></a>Vietnamese Hackers Use PXA Stealer, Hit 4,000 IPs and Steal 200,000 Passwords Globally</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers are calling attention to a new wave of campaigns distributing a Python-based information stealer called PXA Stealer. The malicious activity has been assessed to be the work of Vietnamese-speaking cybercriminals who monetize the stolen data through a subscription-based underground ecosystem that automates the resale and reuse via Telegram APIs, according to a joint report published by Beazley Security and SentinelOne and shared with The Hacker News. ‚ÄúThis discovery showcases a leap in tradecraft, incorporating more nuanced anti-analysis techniques, non-malicious decoy content, and a hardened command-and-control pipeline that frustrates triage and attempts to delay detection,‚Äù security researchers Jim Walter, Alex Delamotte, Francisco Donoso, Sam Mayers, Tell Hause, and Bobby Venal
said
. The campaigns have infected over 4,000 unique IP addresses spanning 62 countries, including South Korea, the United States, the Netherlands, Hungary, and Austria.</p>

<p>Data captured via the stealer includes more than 200,000 unique passwords, hundreds of credit card records, and more than 4 million harvested browser cookies. PXA Stealer was
first documented
by Cisco Talos in November 2024, attributing it to attacks targeting government and education entities in Europe and Asia. It‚Äôs capable of harvesting passwords, browser autofill data, information from cryptocurrency wallets and financial institutions. Data stolen by the malware using Telegram as an exfiltration channel is fed into criminal platforms like Sherlock, a purveyor of stealer logs, from where downstream threat actors can purchase the information to engage in cryptocurrency theft or infiltrate organizations for follow-on purposes, fueling a cybercriminal ecosystem that runs at scale.</p>

<p>Campaigns distributing the malware in 2025 have witnessed a steady tactical evolution, with the threat actors employing DLL side-loading techniques and elaborate staging layers in an effort to fly under the radar. The malicious DLL takes care of conducting the rest of the steps in the infection sequence, ultimately paving the way for the deployment of the stealer, but not before taking steps to display a decoy document, such as a copyright infringement notice, to the victim. The stealer is an updated version boasting capabilities to extract cookies from Chromium-based web browsers by injecting a DLL into running instances with an aim to defeat
app-bound encryption safeguards
. It also plunders data from VPN clients, cloud command-line interface (CLI) utilities, connected fileshares, and applications like Discord.</p>

<p>‚ÄúPXA Stealer uses the BotIDs (stored as TOKEN_BOT) to establish the link between the main bot and the various ChatID (stored as CHAT_ID),‚Äù the researchers said. ‚ÄúThe ChatIDs are Telegram channels with various properties, but they primarily serve to host exfiltrated data and provide updates and notifications to the operators.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis threat has since matured into a highly evasive, multi-stage operation driven by Vietnamese-speaking actors with apparent ties to an organized cybercriminal Telegram-based marketplace that sells stolen victim data.‚Äù

Secret Blizzard Conduct ISP-Level AitM Attacks to Deploy ApolloShadow
‚Äî Russian cyberspies are abusing local internet service providers‚Äô networks to target foreign embassies in Moscow and likely collect intelligence from diplomats‚Äô devices. The activity has been attributed to the Russian advanced persistent threat (APT) known as Secret Blizzard (aka Turla).</p>

<p>It likely involves using an adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) position within domestic telecom companies and ISPs that diplomats are using for Internet access to push a piece of malware called ApolloShadow. This indicates that the ISP may be
working
with the threat actor to facilitate the attacks using the System for Operative Investigative activities (SORM) systems. Microsoft declined to say how many organizations were targeted, or successfully infected, in this campaign. Inside the 2025 Security Shift: What Every Cloud Leader Must Know Now

Companies that Employed Hafnium Hackers Linked to Over a Dozen Patents
‚Äî Threat actors linked to the notorious Hafnium hacking group have worked for companies that registered several patents for highly intrusive forensics and data collection technologies. The findings highlight China‚Äôs diverse private sector offensive ecosystem and an underlying problem with mapping tradecraft to a specific cluster, which may not accurately reflect the true organizational structure of the attackers.</p>

<p>The fact that the threat actors have been attributed to three different companies shows that multiple companies may be working in tandem to conduct the intrusions and those companies may be providing their tools to other actors, leading to incomplete or misleading attribution. It‚Äôs currently not known how the threat actors came to possess the Microsoft Exchange Server flaws that were used to target various entities in a widespread campaign in early 2021. But their close relationship with the Shanghai State Security Bureau (SSSB) has raised the possibility that the bureau may have obtained access to information about the zero-days through some evidence collection method and passed it on to the attackers. The discovery also highlights another important aspect: China-based Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) may actually consist of different companies that serve many clients owing to the contracting ecosystem, which forces these companies to collaborate on intrusions.</p>

<p>In June 2025, Recorded Future
revealed
that a Chinese state-owned defense research institute filed a patent in late December 2024 that analyzes various kinds of intelligence, including OSINT, HUMINT, SIGINT, GEOINT, and TECHINT, to train a military-specific large language model in order to ‚Äúsupport every phase of the intelligence cycle and improve decision-making during military operations.‚Äù
Likely 0-Day SonicWall SSL VPN Flaw Used in Akira Ransomware Attacks
‚Äî SonicWall SSL VPN devices have become the target of Akira ransomware attacks as part of a newfound surge in activity observed in late July 2025. Arctic Wolf Labs said that the attacks could be exploiting an as-yet-undetermined security flaw in the appliances, meaning a zero-day vulnerability, given that some of the incidents affected fully-patched SonicWall devices. However, the possibility of credential-based attacks for initial access hasn‚Äôt been ruled out. The development came as watchTowr Labs detailed multiple vulnerabilities in SonicWall SMA 100 Series appliances (
CVE-2025-40596, CVE-2025-40597, and CVE-2025-40598
) that an attacker could exploit to cause denial-of-service or code execution.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe stumbled across vulnerabilities that feel like they were preserved in amber from a more na√Øve era of C programming,‚Äù security researcher Sina Kheirkhah
said
. ‚ÄúWhile we understand (and agree) that these vulnerabilities are ultimately difficult - or in some cases, currently not exploitable ‚Äì the fact that they exist at all is, frankly, disappointing. Pre-auth stack and heap overflows triggered by malformed HTTP headers aren‚Äôt supposed to happen anymore.‚Äù
UNC2891 Breaches ATM Network via 4G Raspberry Pi in Cyber-Physical Attack
‚Äî The threat actor known as UNC2891 has been observed targeting Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) infrastructure using a 4G-equipped Raspberry Pi as part of a covert attack. The cyber-physical attack involved the adversary leveraging their physical access to install the Raspberry Pi device and have it connected directly to the same network switch as the ATM, effectively placing it within the target bank‚Äôs network.</p>

<p>The end goal of the infection was to deploy the CAKETAP rootkit on the ATM switching server and facilitate fraudulent ATM cash withdrawals. UNC2891 is assessed to share tactical overlaps with another threat actor called UNC1945 (aka LightBasin), which was previously identified compromising managed service providers and striking targets within the financial and professional consulting industries. UNC1945 is also known for its attacks aimed at the telecom sector. Active Exploitation of Alone WordPress Theme Flaw
‚Äî Threat actors are actively exploiting a critical security flaw in ‚ÄúAlone ‚Äì Charity Multipurpose Non-profit WordPress Theme‚Äù to take over susceptible sites.</p>

<p>The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-5394 (CVSS score: 9.8), is an arbitrary file upload affecting all versions of the plugin prior to and including 7.8.3. It has been fixed in version 7.8.5 released on June 16, 2025. In the observed attacks, the flaw is averaged to upload a ZIP archive containing a PHP-based backdoor to execute remote commands and upload additional files. Alternatively, the flaw has also been weaponized to deliver fully-featured file managers and backdoors capable of creating rogue administrator accounts.</p>

<p>Multiple Flaws Patched in AI Code Editor Cursor
‚Äî Several security vulnerabilities have been addressed in Cursor, including one high-severity bug (CVE-2025-54135 aka CurXecute) that could result in remote code execution (RCE) when processing external content from a third-party model context protocol (MCP) server. ‚ÄúIf chained with a separate prompt injection vulnerability, this could allow the writing of sensitive MCP files on the host by the agent,‚Äù Cursor
said
. ‚ÄúThis can then be used to directly execute code by adding it as a new MCP server.‚Äù Also addressed in Cursor version 1.3 is CVE-2025-54136 (CVSS score of 7.2), which could have allowed attackers to swap harmless MCP configuration files for a malicious command, without triggering a warning. ‚ÄúIf an attacker has write permissions on a user‚Äôs active branches of a source repository that contains existing MCP servers the user has previously approved, or an attacker has arbitrary file-write locally, the attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution,‚Äù the company
said

Critical RCE in @nestjs/devtools-integration
‚Äî A critical remote code execution flaw (CVE-2025-54782, CVSS score: 9.4) has been uncovered in @nestjs/devtools-integration, a NestJS npm package downloaded over 56,000 times per week. The package sets up a local development server with an endpoint that executes arbitrary code inside a JavaScript ‚Äúsandbox‚Äù built with node:vm module and the now-abandoned safe-eval, ultimately allowing for execution of untrusted user code in a sandboxed environment, Socket
said
. Further analysis has found that the sandbox is trivially escapable and because the server is
accessible on localhost
, any malicious website can trigger code execution on a developer‚Äôs machine via CSRF using the inspector/graph/interact endpoint.</p>

<p>‚ÄúDue to improper sandboxing and missing cross-origin protections, any malicious website visited by a developer can execute arbitrary code on their local machine,‚Äù Nestjs maintainer Kamil Mysliwiec
said
in an advisory. ‚ÄúBy chaining these issues, a malicious website can trigger the vulnerable endpoint and achieve arbitrary code execution on a developer‚Äôs machine running the NestJS devtools integration.‚Äù
Attackers Exploit Compromised Email Accounts for Attacks
‚Äî Threat actors are increasingly using compromised internal or trusted business partner email accounts to send malicious emails to obtain initial access. ‚ÄúUsing a legitimate trusted account affords an attacker numerous advantages, such as potentially bypassing an organization‚Äôs security controls as well as appearing more trustworthy to the recipient,‚Äù Talos
said
. The disclosure comes as bad actors are also
continuing to exploit
Microsoft 365‚Äôs Direct Send feature to deliver phishing emails that appear to originate from within the organization by using a spoofed internal From address and increases the likelihood of success of social engineering attacks.</p>

<p>The messages are injected into Microsoft 365 tenants via unsecured third-party email security appliances used as SMTP relays. ‚ÄúThis tactic allows attackers to send malicious payloads to Microsoft 365 users with increased credibility, often resulting in successful delivery despite failed authentication checks,‚Äù Proofpoint
said
. Signal Warns it Will Exit Australia Over Encryption Backdoor Push
‚Äî Signal Foundation president Meredith Whittaker
said
the secure messaging application will leave Australia if the government forces it to incorporate a backdoor into its encryption algorithm or demand access to encrypted user data. Earlier this year, the U.K.</p>

<p>government issued a secret order demanding that Apple allow it access to encrypted user data to assist in investigations, resulting in Apple
removing
its Advanced Data Protection (ADP) feature for users in the region. While the U.K. government
appears to be backing down
from its earlier demand, Google
told
TechCrunch that, unlike Apple, it did not receive any request from the U.K. to build a secret backdoor.</p>

<p>This is the first time Google has formally commented on the matter. Google Hardens Chrome Extension Supply Chain Against Account Compromise
‚Äî Google has rolled out a new security feature called Verified CRX Upload for Chrome extension developers that enforces cryptographic signatures for all Chrome extension updates and prevents bad actors from compromising developer accounts and publishing malicious updates to the Chrome Web Store (CWS). The security protection is also designed to address scenarios where CWS code reviews may not always flag such malicious attacks. ‚ÄúWhen opting an extension into Verified CRX Upload, the developer gives Google a public key.</p>

<p>After that, the developer can no longer upload unsigned ZIP files for that extension and must instead upload a CRX file signed with the corresponding private key,‚Äù Google
said
[PDF]. ‚ÄúVerified upload acts as a second factor for the act of uploading to CWS. A malicious actor who compromises a developer‚Äôs account password, session cookies, or even an OAuth token, would not be able to upload a malicious update unless they also gain access to the developer‚Äôs private signing key.‚Äù
Kimsuky Targets South Korea with Stealer Malware
‚Äî The North Korea-linked
Kimsuky
hacking group has been linked to a spear-phishing campaign that targets South Korean entities using Windows shortcut (LNK) files as an initial access vector to trigger a multi-stage infection chain to deploy a keylogger, information stealer, establish persistent control over compromised hosts, and deliver unknown next-stage payloads. In parallel, users are displayed with lure PDF documents related to tax notices and government alerts about alleged sex offenders in the area.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOnce inside, the malware performs extensive system profiling, steals credentials and sensitive documents, monitors user activity through keylogging and clipboard capture, and exfiltrates data in discreet segments over standard web traffic‚Äîhelping it blend into normal network operations,‚Äù Aryaka
said
. Apple macOS Flaw Can Bypass TCC
‚Äî Attackers could have used a recently patched macOS vulnerability to bypass Transparency, Consent, and Control (
TCC
) security checks and steal sensitive user information from locations such as the Downloads directory and Apple Intelligence caches. The flaw, dubbed
Sploitlight
by Microsoft and tracked as CVE-2025-31199, was addressed by Apple with the release of macOS Sequoia 15.4 in March 2025. The attack is so named because it exploits Spotlight plugins called importers, which are used to index data found on a device and surface it via its built-in search tool.</p>

<p>Sploitlight turns these plugins into a TCC bypass, allowing valuable data to be leaked without a user‚Äôs consent. Improved Version of XWorm Spotted
‚Äî A new version of a remote access trojan called
XWorm
(version 6.0) has been
discovered
with new features such as process protection and enhanced anti-analysis capabilities, indicating continued attempts by the developers to iterate and refine their tactics. The starting point of the attack is a Visual Basic Script that‚Äôs likely delivered to targets via social engineering, which then proceeds to set up persistence on the host via Windows Registry (as opposed to scheduled tasks in the previous version), although it‚Äôs important to note that the builder offers three different methods, including the aforementioned techniques and the adding the payload to the Startup folder. It‚Äôs also designed to run a PowerShell script that includes the ability to bypass Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) via in-memory modification of ‚Äúclr.dll‚Äù to sidestep detection.</p>

<p>Some of the new features observed in the latest version of XWorm are its ability to prevent process termination by marking itself as a critical process and killing itself if the compromised host is running Windows XP. Mozilla Warns Add-ons Devs Against Phishing Attack
‚Äî Browser maker Mozilla is
warning
of a phishing campaign targeting its Firefox Add-ons infrastructure that aims to trick developers into parting with their account credentials as part of emails containing messages like ‚ÄúYour Mozilla Add-ons account requires an update to continue accessing developer features‚Äù that are designed to provoke engagement. The disclosure follows the
emergence
of bogus Firefox add-ons that masquerade as TronLink, Solflare, Rabby Wallet and are
designed to steal cryptocurrency wallet secrets
, security researcher Lukasz Olejnik said. New Stealer Malware Dissected
‚Äî Cybersecurity researchers have detailed three new stealer malware families called
Cyber Stealer
,
Raven Stealer
, and
SHUYAL Stealer
that combine extensive credential theft capabilities with advanced system reconnaissance and evasion tactics.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBeyond credential theft, SHUYAL captures system screenshots and clipboard content, exfiltrating this data alongside stolen Discord tokens through a Telegram bot infrastructure,‚Äù Hybrid Analysis said. ‚ÄúThe malware maintains operational stealth through self-deletion mechanisms, removing traces of its activity using a batch file after completing its primary functions.‚Äù Cyber Stealer, for its part, maintains communication with its command-and-control (C2) server through heartbeat checks, XMR miner configuration, task checks, and data exfiltration. It also comes with a clipper, remote shell, reverse proxy, DDoS, XMR mining, and DNS poisoning capabilities based on the subscription tier chosen by a customer. ‚ÄúThe C2 URL can be dynamically updated through Pastebin, with a hardcoded backup URL if that fails,‚Äù eSentire said.</p>

<p>While there are a number of stealers on the cybercrime scene already, the emergence of new stealers demonstrates the lucrative nature of such tools to enable data theft at scale. The third new infostealer malware is Raven Stealer, which is actively distributed through GitHub repositories and promoted via a Telegram channel operated by the threat actors. The stealer is consistent with other stealers, facilitating credential theft, browser data harvesting, and real-time data exfiltration via Telegram bot integration. NOVABLIGHT Node.js Stealer Spotted in the Wild
‚Äî Developed and sold by the Sordeal Group, a threat actor demonstrating French-language proficiency, NOVABLIGHT is marketed as an ‚Äúeducational tool‚Äù on platforms like Telegram and Discord from ‚Ç¨25 for a month to ‚Ç¨140 for six months ($28 to $162).</p>

<p>However, this aspect masks its true intent: A modular, feature-rich NodeJS-based malware built on the Electron framework, designed to steal sensitive information, including login credentials and cryptocurrency wallet data. The malware is said to be distributed via fake websites advertising video game installers. ‚ÄúNOVABLIGHT is a modular and feature-rich information stealer built on Node.js with the Electron framework,‚Äù Elastic Security Labs
said
. ‚ÄúIts capabilities go beyond simple credential theft, incorporating methods for data collection and exfiltration, sandbox detection, and heavy obfuscation.‚Äù
$3.5B LuBian Bitcoin Theft Goes Undetected for Nearly Five Years
‚Äî A previously undisclosed theft of
127,426 Bitcoin
, valued at $3.5 billion at the time (presently approximately $14.5 billion), has been traced back to a December 2020 attack on a little-known Chinese mining pool called LuBian, making it as the largest cryptocurrency theft to date, surpassing the
$1.5 billion Bybit hack
that occurred in February 2025.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThey appear to have been first hacked on December 28th, 2020, for over 90% of their BTC,‚Äù Arkham Intelligence
said
. ‚ÄúSubsequently, on December 29th, around $6M of additional BTC and USDT was stolen from a Lubian address active on the Bitcoin Omni layer. On the 31st, LuBian rotated their remaining funds to recovery wallets.‚Äù It‚Äôs believed that the unknown attackers may have exploited a flawed private key generation algorithm that left it susceptible to brute-force attacks. ‚ÄúLuBian preserved 11,886 BTC, currently worth $1.35B, which they still hold,‚Äù Arkham said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe hacker also still holds the stolen BTC, with their last known movement being a wallet consolidation in July 2024.‚Äù Neither LuBian nor the suspected hacker has ever publicly acknowledged the breach. Russia Blocks Access to Speedtest
‚Äî Russia
blocked
access to Speedtest, a popular internet speed testing tool developed by U.S. company Ookla, claiming the service poses a national security threat and could aid cyber attacks. The restriction is due to the ‚Äúidentified threats to the security of the public communication network and the Russian segment of the internet,‚Äù Roskomnadzor, country‚Äôs communications watchdog,
said
, adding it ‚Äúcollects data on the layout and capacity of Russian communications nodes‚Äù that could be used to ‚Äúplan, conduct, and assess attacks on Russian networks and related systems.‚Äù
CISA Releases Thorium
‚Äî The U.S.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
announced
the public availability of
Thorium
, an open-source platform for malware and forensic analysts across the government, public, and private sectors. ‚ÄúThorium enhances cybersecurity teams‚Äô capabilities by automating analysis workflows through seamless integration of commercial, open-source, and custom tools,‚Äù CISA said. ‚ÄúIt supports various mission functions, including software analysis, digital forensics, and incident response, allowing analysts to efficiently assess complex malware threats.‚Äù The agency has also
released
the Eviction Strategies Tool, which helps security teams during the incident response by providing the necessary actions to contain and evict adversaries from compromised networks and devices. Russian Entities Targeted to Deploy Cobalt Strike
‚Äî The Russian information technology (IT) sector, and to a certain extent companies in China, Japan, Malaysia, and Peru, has been at the receiving end of a spear-phishing email campaign that
delivers
the Cobalt Strike Beacon by means of intermediate payloads that reach out to fake profiles on social media platforms to obtain the URL hosting the post-exploitation toolkit.</p>

<p>The accounts, created on GitHub, Quora, and Russian-language social networks, are said to have been created specifically for the attacks and act as
dead drop resolvers
to facilitate operational resiliency. The activity was first recorded in the second half of 2024, reaching its peak in November and December. The campaign has not been attributed to any known threat actor or group. APT36 Targets Indian Railways, Oil &amp; Gas Sectors
‚Äî A suspected Pakistani threat actor known as APT36 (aka Transparent Tribe) has been attributed to attacks targeting Indian railway systems, oil and gas infrastructure, and the Ministry of External Affairs via spear-phishing attacks to deliver a known malware called
Poseidon
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThey use .desktop files disguised as PDF documents to execute scripts that download malware and establish persistence using cron jobs,‚Äù Hunt.io
said
. ‚ÄúThe Poseidon backdoor, built on the Mythic framework and written in Go, is used to maintain access and support lateral movement.‚Äù
Qilin Ransomware Attack Leverages BYOVD Technique
‚Äî Threat actors associated with
Qilin
ransomware have been observed leveraging a previously unknown driver, TPwSav.sys, to stealthily disable security tools using a custom version of EDRSandblast as part of a Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) attack. ‚ÄúThis driver, originally developed for power-saving features on Toshiba laptops, is a signed Windows kernel driver, making it an attractive choice for bypassing EDR protections through a BYOVD attack,‚Äù Blackpoint Cyber
said
. Prior to this incident, there has been no evidence of in-the-wild exploitation of the driver.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCompiled in 2015 and holding a valid signature, this driver is an appealing candidate for BYOVD attacks aimed at disabling EDR. While interacting with the driver requires only low-level privileges, loading it and enumerating physical memory demand administrative privileges,‚Äù the company added. Phishing Campaign Distributes 0bj3ctivity Stealer
‚Äî Phishing emails bearing purchase order-lures are being used to distribute via JavaScript files a
stealer
called
0bj3ctivity Stealer
, which has been propagated via Ande Loader in the past. ‚ÄúThe further stages are uncommon, including custom PowerShell scripts to deploy the next stages and steganography to hide some of the payloads,‚Äù Trellix
said
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOnce decoded, the PowerShell script will download from archive.org a JPG image, which contains the next stage hidden using steganography.‚Äù The United States, Germany, and Montenegro exhibit a high volume of detections, although telemetry data has also revealed noticeable activity in Europe, North America, Southeast Asia, and Australia, indicating the global nature of the threat. Increasing Number of Flaws Leveraged as 0- or 1-Days
‚Äî A third of flaws leveraged by attackers this year have been zero-day or 1-day flaws, indicating that threat actors are becoming faster at exploiting vulnerabilities. ‚ÄúWe observed an 8.5% increase in the percentage of KEVs [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities] that had exploitation evidence disclosed on or before the day a CVE was published ‚Äî 32.1% in H1-2025 as compared to the 23.6% we reported in 2024,‚Äù VulnCheck
said
. In total, the company added 432 new vulnerabilities to its KEV list in the first half of 2025, with 92 unique threat actors linked to the exploitation efforts.</p>

<p>Of these, 56 (60.8%) were attributed to specific countries, including China (20), Russia (11), North Korea (9), and Iran (6). In a related development, a GreyNoise report
found
that in 80% of reconnaissance spikes against enterprise gear, the increase in activity was followed by the publication of a new CVE within six weeks, suggesting threat actors or researchers are testing their exploits ahead of time. ‚ÄúThese patterns were exclusive to enterprise edge technologies like VPNs, firewalls, and remote access tools ‚Äì the same kinds of systems increasingly targeted by advanced threat actors,‚Äù the threat intelligence firm said. BreachForums Comes Back Online
‚Äî BreachForums
appears to be back again
after it went offline in April.</p>

<p>The popular cybercrime forum was
shut down
and
resurrected
several times over the past year. According to DataBreaches.Net, the official site appears to be back online on its dark web address, while preserving the original user database, reputation, credits, and posts. What‚Äôs more, the site seems to have returned under new leadership ‚Äì a user with the online moniker ‚ÄúN/A.‚Äù In an introductory post, N/A also claimed that none of its administrators have been arrested and that it‚Äôs ‚Äúbusiness as usual.‚Äù
RedCurl‚Äôs New Attacks Deliver RedLoader
‚Äî The threat actor known as
Gold Blade
(aka Earth Kapre, RedCurl, and Red Wolf) has been
linked to a new set of attacks
in July 2025 that combine malicious LNK files and WebDAV to execute remotely hosted DLLs to ultimately launch RedLoader using DLL side-loading. The LNK files, disguised as cover letters in the PDF format, are distributed via phishing emails via third-party job search sites like Indeed.</p>

<p>Mimo Exploits SharePoint Flaws to Deliver Ransomware
‚Äî The threat actor known as
Mimo
is
exploiting
the recently disclosed
Microsoft SharePoint flaws
to deliver the Go-based 4L4MD4r ransomware. The hacking group was
recently linked
to the abuse of a critical Craft CMS flaw to drop miners. The development marks the first time the hacking group has deployed ransomware in the wild. Silver Fox APT Uses Fake Flash Plugin to Deliver Malware
‚Äî The threat actor tracked as Silver Fox has been observed delivering the
Winos
trojan under the guise of popular tools like Adobe Flash, Google Translate, and WPS.</p>

<p>Typical distribution vectors include email,
phishing websites
, and instant messaging software. ‚ÄúHowever, with the leakage of core remote control Trojan source code (such as Winos 4.0) in the cybercrime circle, Silver Fox has gradually transformed from a single organization into a malicious family widely redeveloped by cybercrime groups and even APT organizations,‚Äù the Knownsec 404 team
said
. ‚ÄúWinos has a rich set of functional plug-ins that enable various remote control functions and data theft on the target host.‚Äù
Girona Hacker Arrested
‚Äî Spanish authorities have
apprehended
a cybercriminal who allegedly stole sensitive data from major financial institutions, educational organizations, and private companies across the country. The accused, described as a man with advanced computer programming skills, stands accused of targeting Spanish banks, a driving school, and a public university, among others.</p>

<p>The suspect is alleged to have stolen personal databases of employees and customers, as well as internal documents of companies and organizations, and then sold them for profit. ShadowSyndicate Infrastructure Analyzed
‚Äî Cybersecurity researchers have found connections between
ShadowSyndicate
infrastructure and various malware families like AMOS Stealer, TrueBot, and a number of ransomware strains such as Cl0p, BlackCat, LockBit, Play, Royal, CACTUS, and RansomHub. Aside from having access to a network of bulletproof hosters (BPHs) in Europe, it‚Äôs believed that ShadowSyndicate functions as an initial access broker (IAB) fueling Russian, North Korean, and Chinese APTs. ‚ÄúIt remains unclear whether ShadowSyndicate has a structured business model with formal clients or partners in cybercrime, or whether it represents a more fluid, hybrid threat actor,‚Äù Intrinsec
said
.</p>

<p>Who is Lionishackers? ‚Äî Threat hunters have ripped the cover off Lionishackers, a corporate database seller and a financially motivated threat actor focused on exfiltrating and selling corporate databases through Telegram and underground forums since July 2024. ‚ÄúEven though they seem to have an opportunistic approach when choosing their targets, there seems to be a certain preference for victims located in Asian countries,‚Äù Outpost24
said
. ‚ÄúThey have shown a high level of collaboration with the ‚ÄòHunt3r Kill3rs‚Äô group and extensive participation in relevant underground communities‚Äô Telegram channels.</p>

<p>Furthermore, they also worked on and offered other services such as pen testing, the commercialization of the Ghost botnet, and the launch of a forum project dubbed Stressed Forums.‚Äù
EdskManager RAT, Pulsar RAT, and Retro-C2 RAT Exposed
‚Äî Three new remote access trojans called EdskManager RAT, Pulsar RAT, and Retro-C2 RAT have been flagged by cybersecurity researchers, flagging their ability to evade detection and maintain control over compromised systems. ‚ÄúThe malware employs a downloader disguised as legitimate software, followed by in-memory decryption and stealth communication with command-and-control servers,‚Äù CYFIRMA
said
about EdskManager RAT. ‚ÄúIts use of HVNC (Hidden Virtual Network Computing), advanced persistence techniques, and anti-analysis measures indicates a strong focus on long-term, covert access to infected systems.‚Äù
Pulsar RAT
, on the other hand, is an Android trojan that exploits
accessibility services
to gain near-total control of the device, accessing messages, calls, GPS data, the camera, microphone, and other sensitive data. Developed by a Turkish-speaking threat actor known as ZeroTrace, Retro-C2 RAT employs reflective loading techniques to evade detection and siphon data from compromised machines.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe command-and-control infrastructure is fully web-based and provides threat actors with real-time client monitoring, action management such as CMD, PowerShell, Remote Desktop, keylogging, clipboard capture, file and process management, registry and network operations, audio recording, wallet scanning, persistence operations, and credential recovery,‚Äù ThreatMon
said
. Apple to Enable Advanced Fingerprinting Protection for All Safari Browsing Sessions
‚Äî Apple has
revealed
that it intends to make advanced fingerprinting protection the default for all browsing sessions in Safari with the release of iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26 in September 2025. Currently, the option is limited to Private Browsing mode. The feature was
first introduced
in Safari 17.0.</p>

<p>Security Flaw Uncovered in Catwatchful Spyware
‚Äî An SQL injection vulnerability in an Android stalkerware operation called
Catwatchful
has
exposed
more than 62,000 of its customers, including its Uruguay-based administrator, Omar Soca Charcov. The bug, discovered by researcher Eric Daigle, could be exploited to leak the application‚Äôs database, compromising customers‚Äô email addresses and plaintext passwords. Google has since
added protections
to flag such malicious apps and
suspended the developer‚Äôs Firebase account
for abusing its infrastructure to operate the monitoring software. Ransomware Continues to be a Threat
‚Äî DragonForce has claimed more than 250 victims on its dark web leak site, with 58 in the second quarter of 2025 alone, indicating that the ransomware cartel is gaining traction after purportedly absorbing RansomHub.</p>

<p>Some of the groups that appear to have exited the scene include RansomHub, Babuk-Bjorka, FunkSec, BianLian, 8Base, Cactus, and Hunters International. ‚ÄúWith major RaaS services shutting down, many affiliates are operating independently or seeking new partnerships,‚Äù Check Point
said
. ‚ÄúThe result is a growing number of smaller, often short-lived, ransomware entities. At the same time, established players are actively competing to recruit these ‚Äòorphaned‚Äô affiliates.‚Äù Ransomware attacks have also been observed evolving beyond double extortion to coerce victims into paying up with threats of data leaks and DDoS attacks.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>‚ÄúDouble, triple, and quadruple extortion tactics add pressure by threatening to expose customer information, disrupting operations with distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and sending harassing messages to business partners, customers, and others ‚Äì including informing media of the breach,‚Äù Akamai</dt>
  <dt>said</dt>
  <dt>. Threat Actors Hide Malware in DNS Records</dt>
  <dt>‚Äî While it‚Äôs known that threat actors have leveraged the Domain Name System (DNS) for command-and-control purposes using a technique called</dt>
  <dt>DNS tunneling</dt>
  <dt>, it has been observed that cybercriminals are</dt>
  <dt>evolving their tactics</dt>
  <dt>further by</dt>
  <dt>concealing malicious commands in DNS TXT records</dt>
  <dt>by converting them into their hexadecimal representation and storing them in chunks. The practice is both clever and sneaky as it allows malicious scripts and early-stage malware to fetch binary files without having to download them from attacker-controlled sites or attach them to emails, which have a higher chance of being detected by antivirus software. üé• Cybersecurity Webinars</dt>

Your Keyboard Could Be Spying on You ‚Äî Here‚Äôs How to Tell ‚Äî
Most people don‚Äôt realize it, but your smartphone keyboard can do more than just type.</p>

<p>Some of them quietly connect to the internet, sending back what you type, when you type, and even what‚Äôs in your clipboard. Even trusted apps like Gboard and SwiftKey have cloud sync features that share your typing patterns. And in worse cases, rogue keyboards can log passwords or steal crypto wallet seeds without any visible signs. The fix isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúdon‚Äôt use shady keyboards.‚Äù It‚Äôs knowing how to control what they can do.</p>

<p>Start by using a firewall app like NetGuard or RethinkDNS to block your keyboard from sending data over the internet. Go into your keyboard‚Äôs settings and turn off ‚Äúpersonalization‚Äù or sync features. Watch out for weird behavior like a keyboard asking for access to your mic, contacts, or location ‚Äî those are red flags. On newer Android versions, clipboard alerts will warn you if a keyboard is snooping.</p>

<p>If you want full peace of mind, switch to a keyboard that respects your privacy by design. Options like OpenBoard or Simple Keyboard have no internet access at all. They‚Äôre fast, clean, and open source ‚Äî meaning their code can be audited for hidden behavior. In short: if your keyboard wants to ‚Äúlearn from you,‚Äù make sure it‚Äôs not learning too much.</p>

<p>Conclusion
Every threat we covered this week tells the same story: attackers are evolving faster because they‚Äôre learning from us. From how we code to how we trust, they‚Äôre watching closely. But the flipside? So are we.</p>

<h2 id="man-in-the-middle-attack-prevention-guide"><a id="article-12"></a>Man-in-the-Middle Attack Prevention Guide</h2>

<p>Some of the most devastating cyberattacks don‚Äôt rely on brute force, but instead succeed through stealth. These quiet intrusions often go unnoticed until long after the attacker has disappeared. Among the most insidious are man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where criminals exploit weaknesses in communication protocols to silently position themselves between two unsuspecting parties
Fortunately, protecting your communications from MITM attacks doesn‚Äôt require complex measures. By taking a few simple steps, your security team can go a long way in securing users‚Äô data and keeping silent attackers at bay.</p>

<p>Know your enemy
In a
MITM attack
, a malicious actor intercepts communications between two parties (such as a user and a web app) to steal sensitive information. By secretly positioning themselves between the two ends of the conversation, MITM attackers can capture data like credit card numbers,
login credentials
, and account details. This stolen information often fuels further crimes, including unauthorized purchases, financial account takeovers, and identity theft. The widespread use of MITM attacks speaks to their effectiveness, with several high-profile incidents making headlines and showcasing just how damaging these attacks can be.</p>

<p>Notable examples include the
Equifax data breach
, the
Lenovo Superfish
scandal, and the
DigiNotar
compromise ‚Äì all of which highlight how devastating MitM attacks can be when security controls fail. Common MITM threat vectors
MITM attacks are especially common in environments with unsecured Wi-Fi and a high volume of potential victims (e.g., coffee shops, hotels, or airports). Cybercriminals will look to exploit misconfigured or unsecured networks or deploy rogue hardware that mimics legitimate access points. Once the rogue access point is active, the attacker spoofs the Wi-Fi name (i.e., service set identifier or SSID) to closely resemble a trusted network.</p>

<p>Unsuspecting users, whose devices automatically connect to familiar or strong-signal networks, often join without realizing they‚Äôre on a malicious connection. The role of spoofing in MITM attacks
Spoofing is what allows attackers to disguise themselves as a trusted entity within the environment. This deception enables them to intercept, monitor, or manipulate the data being exchanged without raising suspicion. mDNS and DNS spoofing
mDNS and DNS spoofing are common tactics that trick devices into trusting malicious sources.</p>

<p>Attackers exploit mDNS on local networks by replying to name requests with fake addresses, while DNS spoofing injects false data to redirect users to harmful websites, where sensitive information can be stolen. ARP spoofing
Hackers may intercept local network traffic by exploiting the address resolution protocol (ARP). By replying to a device‚Äôs request for a MAC address with their own, attackers redirect data meant for another device to themselves. This lets them capture and analyze private communications, potentially stealing sensitive information like session tokens and gaining unauthorized access to accounts.</p>

<p>Protecting against MITM attacks
Despite seeming complicated, MITM attacks can be effectively thwarted with the following set of best practices. Encrypt everything
To prevent your data from being intercepted or tampered with, enforce HTTPS and TLS across all web traffic. Use HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to ensure browsers connect only over secure channels, and apply secure cookie flags to protect sensitive information from exposure on unencrypted connections. For mobile and desktop apps, implement certificate pinning to bind apps to specific server certificates ‚Äì this makes it harder for attackers to impersonate trusted services and intercept communications.</p>

<p>Secure your network
Avoid public Wi-Fi when possible, or use a trusted VPN to
encrypt
your traffic and shield it from eavesdroppers. Within your network, segmenting internal systems and isolating untrusted zones helps contain breaches and restrict attackers‚Äô lateral movement. Additionally, deploying DNSSEC cryptographically validates DNS responses, while DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over TLS (DoT) make it harder for attackers to tamper with or spoof domain resolutions by encrypting DNS queries. Authenticate and validate
Implement mutual TLS to require both clients and servers to authenticate each other before connecting, blocking impersonation and interception.</p>

<p>Enforcing
strong multi-factor authentication (MFA)
on critical services adds another layer of protection, making it harder for attackers to exploit stolen credentials. Regularly auditing and rotating TLS certificates and encryption keys is also vital to close security gaps caused by compromised or outdated cryptographic materials. Endpoint and traffic monitoring
To mitigate MITM attacks, security teams should implement a layered defense strategy. Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) can be configured to flag unusual SSL/TLS handshake patterns.</p>

<p>External attack surface management (EASM)
tools are crucial for uncovering vulnerabilities and expired or misconfigured certificates on unknown or unmanaged internet-facing assets. Continuous monitoring for certificate mismatches or unexpected certificate authorities can expose spoofed services and fraudulent intermediaries. Also, advanced endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions can detect common MITM tactics such as ARP spoofing and rogue proxy use, enabling faster investigation and remediation. Educate users
Educating users to heed invalid certificate warnings helps them avoid connecting to malicious or spoofed servers.</p>

<p>At the same time, developers must follow secure-by-default coding practices that never disable certificate validation, as skipping these checks creates critical vulnerabilities. Incorporating both static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST) into the development cycle ensures issues like weak encryption or improper certificate handling are detected and fixed early. Strengthen your Active Directory security today
By focusing on strong, unique passphrases; actively scanning AD for breached credentials; and enforcing MFA everywhere it matters, you eliminate the easiest avenue for attackers to exploit intercepted data. Specops Password Policy
augments Active Directory‚Äôs native password mechanisms by embedding a real-time check against both global breached-password feeds and any custom ban‚Äêlists you configure.</p>

<p>Because it hooks directly into your domain controllers via a lightweight password filter, it intercepts and blocks risky passwords at the moment of creation ‚Äì stopping attackers from leveraging exposed credentials. With granular OU-based policy objects, centralized reporting dashboards, and integration points for MFA and
Self Service Password Resets (SSPR)
, it provides a comprehensive, low-overhead way to ensure that nobody in your organization is reusing or choosing weak or breached passwords. Reach out for a live demo

<h2 id="new-plague-pam-backdoor-exposes-critical-linux-systems-to-silent-credential-theft"><a id="article-13"></a>New ‚ÄòPlague‚Äô PAM Backdoor Exposes Critical Linux Systems to Silent Credential Theft</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have flagged a previously undocumented Linux backdoor dubbed
Plague
that has managed to evade detection for a year. ‚ÄúThe implant is built as a malicious
PAM
(Pluggable Authentication Module), enabling attackers to silently bypass system authentication and gain persistent SSH access,‚Äù Nextron Systems researcher Pierre-Henri Pezier
said
. Pluggable Authentication Modules refers to a suite of shared libraries used to manage user authentication to applications and services in Linux and UNIX-based systems. Given that PAM modules are loaded into privileged authentication processes, a rogue PAM can
enable
theft of user credentials, bypass authentication checks, and remain undetected by security tools.</p>

<p>The cybersecurity company said it uncovered multiple Plague artifacts uploaded to VirusTotal since July 29, 2024, with none of them detected by antimalware engines as malicious. What‚Äôs more, the presence of several samples signals active development of the malware by the unknown threat actors behind it. Plague boasts of four prominent features: Static credentials to allow covert access, resist analysis and reverse engineering using anti-debugging and string obfuscation; and enhanced stealth by erasing evidence of an SSH session. This, in turn, is accomplished by unsetting environment variables such as
SSH_CONNECTION and SSH_CLIENT
using unsetenv, and redirecting
HISTFILE
to /dev/null to prevent shell command logging, in order to avoid leaving an audit trail.</p>

<p>‚ÄúPlague integrates deeply into the authentication stack, survives system updates, and leaves almost no forensic traces,‚Äù Pezier noted. ‚ÄúCombined with layered obfuscation and environment tampering, this makes it exceptionally hard to detect using traditional tools.‚Äù
