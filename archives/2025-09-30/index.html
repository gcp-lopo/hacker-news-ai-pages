<h2 id="evilai-malware-masquerades-as-ai-tools-to-infiltrate-global-organizations"><a id="article-1"></a>EvilAI Malware Masquerades as AI Tools to Infiltrate Global Organizations</h2>

<p>Threat actors have been observed using seemingly legitimate artificial intelligence (AI) tools and software to sneakily slip malware for future attacks on organizations worldwide. According to Trend Micro, the campaign is using productivity or AI-enhanced tools to deliver malware targeting various regions, including Europe, the Americas, and the Asia, Middle East, and Africa (AMEA) region. Manufacturing, government, healthcare, technology, and retail are some of the top sectors affected by the attacks, with India, the U.S., France, Italy, Brazil, Germany, the U.K., Norway, Spain, and Canada emerging as the regions with the most infections, indicating a global spread. ‚ÄúThis swift, widespread distribution across multiple regions strongly indicates that EvilAI is not an isolated incident but rather an active and evolving campaign currently circulating in the wild,‚Äù security researchers Jeffrey Francis Bonaobra, Joshua Aquino, Emmanuel Panopio, Emmanuel Roll, Joshua Lijandro Tsang, Armando Nathaniel Pedragoza, Melvin Singwa, Mohammed Malubay, and Marco Dela Vega said.</p>

<p>The campaign has been codenamed EvilAI by Trend Micro, describing the attackers behind the operation as ‚Äúhighly capable‚Äù owing to their ability to blur the line between authentic and deceptive software for malware distribution and their ability to conceal its malicious features in otherwise functional applications. Some of the programs distributed using the method include AppSuite, Epi Browser,
JustAskJacky
, Manual Finder,
OneStart
, PDF Editor, Recipe Lister, and Tampered Chef. Some aspects of the campaign were
documented in detail
by Expel, G DATA, and TRUESEC last month. What‚Äôs significant about the campaign is the lengths to which the attackers have gone to make these apps appear authentic and ultimately carry out a slew of nefarious activities in the background once installed, without raising any red flags.</p>

<p>The deception is further enhanced by the use of signing certificates from disposable companies, as older signatures are revoked. ‚ÄúEvilAI disguises itself as productivity or AI-enhanced tools, with professional-looking interfaces and valid digital signatures that make it difficult for users and security tools to distinguish it from legitimate software,‚Äù Trend Micro said. The end goal of the campaign is to conduct extensive reconnaissance, exfiltrate sensitive browser data, and maintain encrypted, real-time communication with its command-and-control (C2) servers using AES-encrypted channels to receive attacker commands and deploy additional payloads. It essentially makes use of several propagation methods, including using newly registered websites that mimic vendor portals, malicious ads, SEO manipulation, and promoted download links on forums and social media.</p>

<p>EvilAI, per Trend Micro, is used as a stager, chiefly acting as a conduit to gain initial access, establish persistence, and prepare the infected system for additional payloads, while taking steps to enumerate installed security software and hinder analysis. ‚ÄúRather than relying on obviously malicious files, these trojans mimic the appearance of real software to go unnoticed into both corporate and personal environments, often gaining persistent access before raising any suspicion,‚Äù the company
said
. ‚ÄúThis dual-purpose approach ensures the user‚Äôs expectations are met, further lowering the chance of suspicion or investigation.‚Äù
Further analysis by G GATA has also determined that the threat actors behind OneStart, ManualFinder, and AppSuite are the same and that the server infrastructure is shared for distributing and configuring all these programs. ‚ÄúThey have been peddling malware disguised as games, print recipe, recipe finder, manual finder, and lately, adding the buzzword ‚ÄòAI‚Äô to lure users,‚Äù security researcher Banu Ramakrishnan
said
.</p>

<p>Expel said the developers behind AppSuite and PDF Editor campaigns have used at least 26 code-signing certificates issued for companies in Panama and Malaysia, among others, over the last seven years to make their software appear legitimate. The cybersecurity company is tracking the malware signed using these certificates under the name BaoLoader, adding it‚Äôs different from TamperedChef, citing differences in the behavioral differences and the certificate patterns. It‚Äôs worth noting that the name TamperedChef was first
attributed
to a
malicious
recipe application
that‚Äôs configured to set up a stealthy communication channel with a remote server and receive commands that facilitate data theft. ‚ÄúTamperedChef used code-signing certificates issued to companies in Ukraine and Great Britain while BaoLoader consistently used certificates from Panama and Malaysia,‚Äù the company
pointed out
.</p>

<p>And that‚Äôs not all. Field Effect
and
GuidePoint Security
have since uncovered more digitally signed binaries that masquerade as calendar and image viewer tools, and make use of the NeutralinoJS desktop framework to execute arbitrary JavaScript code and siphon sensitive data. ‚ÄúThe use of NeutralinoJS to execute JavaScript payloads and interact with native system APIs enabled covert file system access, process spawning, and network communication,‚Äù Field Effect said. ‚ÄúThe malware‚Äôs use of Unicode homoglyphs to encode payloads within seemingly benign API responses allowed it to bypass string-based detection and signature matching.‚Äù
The Canadian cybersecurity company said the presence of several code-signing publishers across multiple samples suggests either a shared malware-as-a-service provider or a code-signing marketplace that facilitates broad distribution.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe TamperedChef campaign illustrates how threat actors are evolving their delivery mechanisms by weaponizing potentially unwanted applications, abusing digital code signing, and deploying covert encoding techniques,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúThese tactics allow malware to masquerade as legitimate software, bypass endpoint defenses, and exploit user trust.‚Äù

Cisco 0-Day Flaws Under Attack
‚Äî Cybersecurity agencies warned that threat actors have exploited two security flaws affecting Cisco firewalls as part of zero-day attacks to deliver previously undocumented malware families like RayInitiator and LINE VIPER. The RayInitiator and LINE VIPER malware represent a significant evolution on that used in the previous campaign, both in sophistication and its ability to evade detection. The activity involves the exploitation of CVE-2025-20362 (CVSS score: 6.5) and CVE-2025-20333 (CVSS score: 9.9) to bypass authentication and execute malicious code on susceptible appliances.</p>

<p>The campaign is assessed to be linked to a threat cluster dubbed ArcaneDoor, which was attributed to a suspected China-linked hacking group known as UAT4356 (aka Storm-1849). Future-Ready Protection for Microsoft

Nimbus Manticore Uses MiniJunk in Critical Infra Attacks
‚Äî An Iran-aligned cyber espionage group has expanded its operations beyond its traditional Middle Eastern hunting grounds to target critical infrastructure organizations across Western Europe using constantly evolving malware variants and attack tactics. Nimbus Manticore, which overlaps with UNC1549 or Smoke Sandstorm, has been observed targeting defense manufacturing, telecommunications, and aviation companies in Denmark, Portugal, and Sweden. Central to the campaign are MiniJunk, an obfuscated backdoor that gives the attacker persistent access to infected systems, and MiniBrowse, a lightweight stealer with separate versions for stealing credentials from Chrome and Edge browsers. MiniJunk is an updated version of MINIBIKE (aka SlugResin), with the emails directing victims to fake job-related login pages that appear to be associated with companies like Airbus, Boeing, Flydubai, and Rheinmetall.</p>

<p>In a further escalation of its tactics, Nimbus Manticore has been observed using the service SSL.com starting around May 2025 to sign their code and pass off malware as legitimate software programs, leading to a ‚Äúdrastic decrease in detections.‚Äù
ShadowV2 Targets Docker for DDoS Attacks
‚Äî A novel ShadowV2 bot campaign is turning distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks into a full-blown for-hire business by targeting misconfigured Docker containers on AWS. Instead of relying on prebuilt malicious images, the attackers build containers on the victim‚Äôs machine itself to launch a Go-based RAT that can launch DDoS attacks. The exact rationale of the approach is unclear, though Darktrace researchers suggest it may have been a way to reduce forensic traces from importing a malicious container. Once installed, the malware sends a heartbeat signal to the C2 server every second, while also polling for new attack commands every five seconds.</p>

<p>Cloudflare Mitigates Largest DDoS Attack on Record
‚Äî Web performance and security company Cloudflare said its systems blocked a record-breaking distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that peaked at 22.2 terabits per second (Tbps) and 10.6 billion packets per second (Bpps), and lasted only 40 seconds. The attack was aimed at a single IP address of an unnamed European network infrastructure company. It‚Äôs believed that the attack may be powered by the AISURU botnet. Vane Viper Linked to Malicious Campaigns Distributing Malware
‚Äî A high-volume cybercrime operation known as Vane Viper that‚Äôs been active for more than a decade is supported by a commercial digital advertising platform with a checkered past.</p>

<p>Vane Viper takes advantage of hundreds of thousands of compromised websites and malicious ads that redirect unsuspecting Web users to destinations such as exploit kits, malware, and sketchy websites. The findings suggest that Vane Viper is not acting as an unwitting intermediary but is a complicit enabler and active participant in malicious operations. It also shares parallels with VexTrio Viper in that both emerged from Eastern Europe around 2015 and are controlled by the Russian diaspora in Europe and Cyprus. ‚ÄúURL Solutions, Webzilla, and AdTech Holding form a closely connected trio of firms: domains registered en masse via a registrar steeped in cybercrime, hosted on infrastructure operated by a company that‚Äôs hosted everything from Methbot to state-sponsored disinformation, and payloads delivered via an ad network long implicated in malvertising,‚Äù Infoblox said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNot only has PropellerAds turned a ‚Äòblind eye‚Äô to criminal abuse of their platform, but indicators [‚Ä¶] suggest ‚Äì with moderate-to-high confidence ‚Äì that several ad-fraud campaigns originated from infrastructure attributed to PropellerAds.‚Äù
2 New Supermicro BMC Bugs Allow Implanting Malicious Firmware
‚Äî Servers running on motherboards sold by Supermicro contain medium-severity vulnerabilities that can allow hackers to remotely install malicious firmware that runs even before the operating system, providing unprecedented persistence. That said, the caveat is that the threat actor needs to have
administrative access
to the
BMC
control interface to perform the update, or distribute them as part of a supply chain attack by compromising the servers used to host firmware updates and replacing the original images with malicious ones, all while keeping the signature valid. Supermicro said it has updated the BMC firmware to mitigate the vulnerabilities, adding that it‚Äôs currently testing and validating affected products. The current status of the update is unknown.</p>

<p>‚ÄéÔ∏è‚Äçüî• Trending CVEs

Microsoft Offers ESU for Free in the E.U. ‚Äî Microsoft has
decided
to offer free extended security updates for Windows 10 users in the European Economic Area (EEA), following pressure from the Euroconsumers group.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe are pleased to learn that Microsoft will provide a no-cost Extended Security Updates (ESU) option for Windows 10 consumer users in the European Economic Area (EEA),‚Äù Euroconsumers
said
. In other regions, users will need to either enable Windows Backup or pay $30 for the year or redeem 1,000 Microsoft Reward points. It‚Äôs worth noting that Windows 10 reached end of support (EoS) on October 14, 2025. Olymp Loader Spotted in the Wild
‚Äî A new malware loader called Olymp Loader has been spotted in the wild, being propagated via GitHub repositories, or through tools disguised as popular software such as PuTTY, OpenSSL, Zoom, and even a Counter Strike mod called Classic Offensive.</p>

<p>Written in assembly language, the malware-as-a-service (MaaS) solution provides built-in stealer modules, including a custom version of BrowserSnatch that‚Äôs available on GitHub. Campaigns using Olymp have been found to deliver an array of information stealers and remote access trojans like Lumma, Raccoon, WebRAT (aka SalatStealer), and Quasar RAT. The tool was first advertised by a seller named OLYMPO in HackForums on June 5, 2025, as a botnet, before evolving into a loader and a crypter. ‚ÄúThe malware seller has published a roadmap that treats Olymp as a bundle comprising Olymp Botnet, Olymp Loader, Olymp Crypter, an install service, and a file‚Äëscanning tool for antivirus testing,‚Äù Outpost24
said
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt remains to be seen whether OLYMPO can sustain and support a broader malware product suite over time.‚Äù Regardless, the emergence of yet another bundled crimeware stack can further lower the entry barrier for less experienced threat actors, allowing them to mount widespread campaigns at scale within a short amount of time. Malicious Facebook Ads Lead to JSCEAL Malware
‚Äî Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed an
ongoing
campaign
that‚Äôs using
bogus ads
on Facebook and Google to distribute premium versions of trading platforms like TradingView for free. According to Bitdefender, the activity has also expanded to YouTube, where sponsored ads on the platform are being used to direct users to malware-laced downloads that steal credentials and compromise accounts. These ads are posted via legitimate-but-compromised verified YouTube accounts to serve the ads.</p>

<p>The attackers take pains to ensure that the hijacked channels mimic the official TradingView channel by reusing the latter‚Äôs branding and playlists to build credibility. An unlisted video uploaded by the rebranded channel, titled ‚ÄúFree TradingView Premium ‚Äì Secret Method They Don‚Äôt Want You to Know,‚Äù is estimated to have racked up more than 182,000 views through aggressive advertising. ‚ÄúThe unlisted status is deliberate, of course. By not being publicly searchable, these malicious videos avoid casual reporting and platform moderation,‚Äù Bitdefender
said
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúInstead, they are shown exclusively through ad placements, ensuring they reach their targets while remaining hidden from public view.‚Äù The attacks ultimately led to the deployment of malware known as
JSCEAL
(aka WEEVILPROXY) to steal sensitive data. LockBit 5.0 Analyzed
‚Äî The threat actors behind the
LockBit ransomware
have released a ‚Äúsignificantly more dangerous‚Äù version, LockBit 5.0, on its sixth anniversary, with advanced obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques, while being capable of targeting Windows, Linux, and ESXi systems. ‚ÄúThe 5.0 version also shares code characteristics with LockBit 4.0, including identical hashing algorithms and API resolution methods, confirming this is an evolution of the original codebase rather than an imitation,‚Äù Trend Micro
said
. ‚ÄúThe preservation of core functionalities while adding new evasion techniques demonstrates the group‚Äôs strategy of incremental improvement to their ransomware platform.‚Äù LockBit may not be the most prolific ransomware group it once was ever since its infrastructure was disrupted in a law enforcement operation early last year, but the findings show that it continues to be as aggressive as ever when it comes to refining and retooling its tactics.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe Windows binary uses heavy obfuscation and packing: it loads its payload through DLL reflection while implementing anti-analysis techniques like ETW patching and terminating security services,‚Äù the company said. ‚ÄúMeanwhile, the newly discovered Linux variant maintains similar functionality with command-line options for targeting specific directories and file types. The ESXi variant specifically targets VMware virtualization environments, designed to encrypt entire virtual machine infrastructures in a single attack.‚Äù
Microsoft Blocks Access to Services Used by Israeli Military Unit
‚Äî Microsoft has
revealed
that it ‚Äúceased and disabled‚Äù a set of services to Unit 8200 within the Israel Ministry of Defense (IMOD) that were used to enable mass surveillance of civilians in Gaza and the West Bank. It said it found evidence ‚Äúrelating to IMOD consumption of Azure storage capacity in the Netherlands and the use of AI services.‚Äù The secretive
contract
came to light last month following a
report
by The Guardian, along with +972 Magazine and Local Call, that revealed how Microsoft‚Äôs Azure service was being used to store and process millions of Palestinian civilian phone calls made each day in Gaza and the West Bank.</p>

<p>The newspaper reported that the trove of intercepted calls amounted to 8,000 terabytes of data and was held in a Microsoft data center in the Netherlands. The collected data has been
moved
out of the country and is being planned to be transferred to the Amazon Web Services cloud platform. Ransomware Groups Use Stolen AWS Keys to Breach Cloud
‚Äî Ransomware gangs are using Amazon Web Services (AWS) keys stored in local environments, such as Veeam backup servers, to pivot to a victim‚Äôs AWS account and steal data with the help of the
Pacu
AWS exploitation framework, turning what started as an on-premise event into a
cloud compromise
. ‚ÄúThreat actors are becoming increasingly adept at exploiting cloud environments ‚Äî leveraging compromised AWS keys, targeting backup servers, and using advanced attack frameworks to evade detection,‚Äù Varonis
said
.</p>

<p>Meta Unveils Ad-Free Option in the U.K. ‚Äî Meta has launched an ad-free experience for Facebook and Instagram in the U.K., allowing users to pay ¬£2.99 a month to access the platforms without ads on the web, and ¬£3.99 a month for Android and iOS. ‚ÄúWe will notify UK users over the age of 18 that they have the choice to subscribe to Facebook and Instagram for a fee to use these services without seeing ads,‚Äù the company
said
. ‚ÄúA reduced, additional fee of ¬£2/month on the web or ¬£3/month on iOS and Android will automatically apply for each additional account listed in a user‚Äôs Account Center.‚Äù Meta has significant hurdles in
rolling out the scheme
in the E.U., causing it to
walk back
its ad model, offering users the choice to receive ‚Äúless personalized ads‚Äù that are full-screen and temporarily unskippable.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Earlier this May, the European Commission</dt>
  <dt>said</dt>
  <dt>the model does not comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and fined Meta ‚Ç¨200 million. In response, the company said it would need to make modifications to the model that ‚Äúcould result in a materially worse user experience for European users and a significant impact.‚Äù In a report published in July 2025, privacy non-profit noyb</dt>

Dutch Teen Duo Arrested Over Alleged ‚ÄòWi-Fi Sniffing‚Äô for Russia
‚Äî Two teenagers have been
arrested
in the Netherlands on
suspicion of espionage
, reportedly on behalf of Russian intelligence agencies. The boys, both aged 17, were arrested on Monday. One has been remanded in custody while the other has been released on home bail. The arrests are related to laws regarding state-sponsored interference, but additional details have been withheld due to the age of the suspects and the ongoing investigation.</p>

<p>The teens are alleged to have been tasked with carrying a ‚ÄúWi-Fi sniffer‚Äù along a route past buildings in The Hague, including the headquarters of Europol and Eurojust, as well as several embassies. Akira Ransomware Breaching MFA-Protected SonicWall VPN Accounts
‚Äî Cybersecurity researchers have warned about an ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù Akira
ransomware campaign targeting SonicWall VPNs
to rapidly deploy the locker as part of an attack wave that began on July 21, 2025. ‚ÄúIn almost all intrusions, ransomware encryption took place in under four hours from initial access, with a staging interval as short as 55 minutes in some instances,‚Äù Arctic Wolf said in a new report. Other commonly observed post-exploitation activities include internal network scanning, Impacket SMB activity tied to discovery, Active Directory discovery, and VPN client logins originating from Virtual Private Server (VPS) hosting providers.</p>

<p>Targeting firewall and LDAP-synchronized, several intrusions have involved the threat actors leveraging the dedicated account used for Active Directory synchronization to log in via SSL VPN, despite not being intentionally configured for such access. In more than 50% of the analyzed intrusions, login attempts were observed against accounts with the One Time Password (OTP) feature enabled. ‚ÄúMalicious logins were followed within minutes by port scanning, Impacket SMB activity, and rapid deployment of Akira ransomware,‚Äù the company
noted
. ‚ÄúVictims spanned across multiple sectors and organization sizes, suggesting opportunistic mass exploitation.‚Äù
Four People to Face Trial Over Greece Spyware Scandal
‚Äî Four individuals, two Israeli and two Greek employees of spyware vendor Intellect, are
expected to face trial
in Greece over the use of the
Predator surveillance tool
by the ruling government in 2022 to eavesdrop on judges, senior military officers, journalists, and the opposition.</p>

<p>But to date, no government officials have been charged in connection with the scandal. Phishing Emails Lead to DarkCloud Stealer
‚Äî The information stealer known as DarkCloud is being distributed via phishing emails masquerading as financial correspondence that trick recipients into opening malicious ZIP archives. The stealer, besides adding new layers of encryption and evasion, targets web browser data, keystrokes, FTP credentials, clipboard contents, email clients, files, and cryptocurrency wallets. Stolen credentials/data are sent to attacker-controlled Telegram, FTP, SMTP, or Web Panel (PHP) endpoints.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>It‚Äôs marketed on Telegram by a user named @BluCoder and on the clearnet through the domain darkcloud.onlinewebshop[.]net. It‚Äôs advertised as the ‚Äúbest surveillance software for parents, spouses, and employers.‚Äù Cybersecurity company eSentire</dt>
  <dt>said</dt>
  <dd>‚ÄúDarkCloud is an information-stealing malware written in VB6 and is actively being updated to target a wide range of applications, including email clients, FTP clients, cryptocurrency wallets, web browsers and supports numerous other information-stealing capabilities like keystroke/clipboard harvesting, clipboard hijacking, and file collection.‚Äù
Nupay Plugs ‚ÄúConfiguration Gap‚Äù
‚Äî Indian fintech company Nupay said it addressed a configuration gap after UpGuard
flagged
an unprotected Amazon S3 storage bucket containing more than 270,000 documents related to bank transfers of Indian customers. The exposed information included bank account numbers, transaction amounts, names, phone numbers, and email addresses. The data was linked to at least 38 different banks and financial institutions.</dd>
</dl>

<p>It‚Äôs currently not known how long the data was left publicly accessible on the internet, although misconfigurations of this kind are not uncommon. Nupay
told
TechCrunch the bucket exposed a ‚Äúlimited set of test records with basic customer details,‚Äù and that a majority of the details were ‚Äúdummy or test files.‚Äù
Top AI Chatbots Provide Answers with False Claims
‚Äî Some of the top AI chatbots‚Äô tendency to repeat false claims on topics in the news increased nearly twice as much as they did last year, according to an audit by NewsGuard. The disinformation rates of the chatbots have almost doubled, going from 18% in August 2024 to 35% a year later, with the tools providing false claims to news prompts more than one-third of the time. ‚ÄúInstead of citing data cutoffs or refusing to weigh in on sensitive topics, the LLMs now pull from a polluted online information ecosystem ‚Äî sometimes deliberately seeded by vast networks of malign actors, including Russian disinformation operations ‚Äî and treat unreliable sources as credible,‚Äù it
said
.</p>

<p>Israel‚Äôs PM Says His U.N. Speech Streamed Directly to Gaza Cellphones
‚Äî Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said
his speech at the United Nations last week was also pushed to mobile phones of Gaza residents in an unprecedented operation. ‚ÄúLadies and gentlemen, thanks to special efforts by Israeli intelligence, my words are now also being carried,‚Äù Netanyahu
said
. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre streamed live through the cell phones of Gaza.‚Äù There is
no evidence
for how it would‚Äôve worked or if this actually took place.</p>

<p>Fake Teams Installers Lead to Oyster Malware
‚Äî Threat actors are
abusing
SEO poisoning and malvertising to lure users searching for Teams online into downloading a fake installer that leads to malware called
Oyster
(aka Broomstick or CleanUpLoader). ‚ÄúOyster is a modular, multistage backdoor that provides persistent remote access, establishes Command and Control (C2) communications, collects host information, and enables the delivery of follow-on payloads,‚Äù Blackpoint
said
. ‚ÄúBy hiding behind a widely used collaboration platform, Oyster is well positioned to evade casual detection and blend into the noise of normal enterprise activity.‚Äù The activity has been attributed by Conscia to
Vanilla Tempest
(aka Storm-0832 or Vice Society). Flaw in Streamlit Framework Patched
‚Äî Cybersecurity researchers discovered a vulnerability in the Streamlit app deployment framework that can allow attackers to hijack underlying cloud servers.</p>

<p>‚ÄúTo do that, threat actors bypass file type restrictions and take full control of a misconfigured cloud instance running Streamlit applications,‚Äù Cato Networks
said

<p>üîí Tip of the Week
Hardening Active Directory Against Modern Attacks ‚Äî
Active Directory is a prime target‚Äîcompromise it and attackers can own your network. Strengthen its defenses starting with Kerberos FAST (Flexible Authentication Secure Tunneling), which encrypts pre-authentication traffic to block offline password cracking and relay attacks. Deploy it in ‚ÄúSupported‚Äù mode, monitor KDC events (IDs 34, 35), then enforce ‚ÄúRequired‚Äù once all clients are ready. Run PingCastle for a rapid forest health check and use ADeleg/ADeleginator to uncover dangerous over-delegation in OUs or service accounts.</p>

<p>Harden password security with Fine-Grained Password Policies (FGPP) and automate local admin password rotation using LAPS or Lithnet Password Protection to block breached credentials in real time. Tighten other control layers: use AppLocker Inspector/Gen to lock down application execution and GPOZaurr to detect orphaned or risky Group Policy Objects. Scan AD Certificate Services with Locksmith to close misconfigurations and use ScriptSentry to catch malicious logon scripts that enable stealthy persistence. Finally, apply CIS or Microsoft security baselines and generate custom Attack Surface Reduction rules with ASRGen to block exploit techniques that bypass standard policies.</p>

<p>This layered, rarely implemented strategy raises the cost of compromise and forces even advanced adversaries to work far harder. Conclusion
These headlines show how tightly connected our defenses must be in today‚Äôs threat landscape. No single team, tool, or technology can stand alone‚Äîstrong security depends on shared awareness and action. Take a moment to pass these insights along, spark a conversation with your team, and turn this knowledge into concrete steps.</p>

<h2 id="the-state-of-ai-in-the-soc-2025---insights-from-recent-study"><a id="article-3"></a>The State of AI in the SOC 2025 - Insights from Recent Study</h2>

<p>Security leaders are embracing AI for triage, detection engineering, and threat hunting as alert volumes and burnout hit breaking points. A
comprehensive survey
of 282 security leaders at companies across industries reveals a stark reality facing modern Security Operations Centers: alert volumes have reached unsustainable levels, forcing teams to leave critical threats uninvestigated. You can download the full report
here
. The research, conducted primarily among US-based organizations, shows that AI adoption in security operations has shifted from experimental to essential as teams struggle to keep pace with an ever-growing stream of security alerts.</p>

<p>The findings paint a picture of an industry at a tipping point, where traditional SOC models are buckling under operational pressure and AI-powered solutions are emerging as the primary path forward. Alert Volume Reaches Breaking Point
Security teams are drowning in alerts, with organizations processing an average of 960 alerts per day. Large enterprises face an even more daunting reality, handling over 3,000 daily alerts from an average of 30 different alert-generating security tools. This volume creates a fundamental operational crisis where security teams must make difficult detection and investigation decisions under extreme time pressure.</p>

<p>The survey reveals that alert fatigue has evolved beyond an emotional burden to become a measurable operational risk. Investigations Remain Slow and Manual
The sheer mathematics of alert processing exposes the problem‚Äôs scale. The survey results revealed that it takes an average of 70 minutes to fully investigate an alert, that is, if someone can find the time to look at it. According to the survey, a full 56 minutes pass on average before anyone acts on an alert.</p>

<p>This impossibility forces difficult choices about which alerts receive attention and which get ignored. The survey results have unequivocally demonstrated a critical and well-known challenge within Security Operations Centers (SOCs): the sheer volume of alerts generated daily far exceeds the capacity of human analysts to investigate them thoroughly. Compounding the problem, modern security stacks and data sources continue to grow in number and complexity, leading to longer investigation times. For high-priority incidents requiring immediate attention, these timeframes represent unacceptable delays that can compound breach severity.</p>

<p>According to the latest CrowdStrike
Cyber Threat Report
, it only takes 48 minutes on average for a cyber threat like a
Business Email Compromise
to result in an incident. The Hidden Cost of Overwhelmed SOCs
This overwhelming influx creates an impossible dilemma, forcing SOC teams to make difficult and often risky choices about which alerts receive attention and which are, by necessity, ignored. The consequence of this impossible situation is a heightened risk of missing genuine threats amidst the noise, ultimately compromising an organization‚Äôs security posture. 40% of security alerts go completely uninvestigated due to volume and resource constraints.</p>

<p>Even more troubling, 61% of security teams admitted to ignoring alerts that later proved to be critical security incidents. This statistic represents a fundamental breakdown in security operations. Teams designed to protect organizations are systematically unable to examine nearly half of the potential threats they detect. The survey reveals that this isn‚Äôt negligence but rather a forced adaptation to impossible workload demands.</p>

<p>SOC Teams Struggle with 24/7 Operations
The survey exposes critical gaps in round-the-clock security coverage. Many organizations lack sufficient staffing to maintain effective 24/7 SOC operations, creating vulnerability windows during off-hours when skeleton crews handle the same alert volumes that overwhelm full-strength day shifts. Analyst burnout has become a quantifiable problem rather than just an HR concern. Teams report that suppressing detection rules has become a default coping mechanism when alert volumes become unmanageable.</p>

<p>This approach reduces immediate workload but potentially creates blind spots in security coverage. The staffing challenges are compounded by the specialized nature of security analysis work. Organizations cannot easily scale their teams to match alert volume growth, particularly given the shortage of experienced cybersecurity professionals in the current job market. AI transitions from experiment to strategic priority
AI for security operations
has rapidly climbed the priority ladder, now ranking as a top-three initiative alongside core security programs like cloud security and data security.</p>

<p>This signals a fundamental shift in how security leaders view AI as a critical enabler for operational success today. Currently, 55% of security teams already deploy AI copilots and assistants in production to support alert triage and investigation workflows. The next wave of adoption is coming fast. Among teams not yet using AI, 60% plan to evaluate AI-powered SOC solutions within the year.</p>

<p>And looking ahead, 60% of all SOC workloads are expected to be handled by AI in the next three years, according to the survey. Organizations seek AI for core investigative tasks
Security teams have identified where AI can make the biggest immediate difference. Triage tops the list at 67%, followed closely by detection tuning (65%) and
threat hunting
(64%). These priorities reflect a growing desire to apply AI to the early stages of investigation and surfacing meaningful alerts while providing initial context, and offloading repetitive analysis.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not about automating away human judgment, but about accelerating workflows and sharpening human focus. Barriers Remain but Momentum is Clear
Despite strong adoption intentions, security leaders identify meaningful barriers to AI implementation. Data privacy concerns, integration complexity, and explainability requirements top the list of organizational hesitations. The Future SOC Takes Shape
The survey data reveals a clear trajectory toward hybrid security operations where AI handles routine analysis tasks and human analysts focus on complex investigations and strategic decision-making.</p>

<p>This evolution promises to address both the volume problem and analyst burnout simultaneously. Success metrics for this transformation will likely center on operational efficiency improvements. Organizations will measure progress through reduced Mean Time to Investigation (MTTI) and
Mean Time to Response
(MTTR) in addition to traditional alert closure rates. Other meaningful success metrics include using
AI to upskill and train new SOC Analyst
and dramatically accelerate ramp up time.</p>

<p>By ensuring comprehensive alert coverage through AI augmentation, organizations can reduce the risk tolerance currently forced by volume constraints. The future SOC will investigate more alerts more thoroughly while requiring less manual effort from human analysts. How Prophet Security Helps Customers

<h2 id="microsoft-flags-ai-driven-phishing-llm-crafted-svg-files-outsmart-email-security"><a id="article-4"></a>Microsoft Flags AI-Driven Phishing: LLM-Crafted SVG Files Outsmart Email Security</h2>

<p>Microsoft is calling attention to a new phishing campaign primarily aimed at U.S.-based organizations that has likely utilized code generated using large language models (LLMs) to obfuscate payloads and evade security defenses. ‚ÄúAppearing to be aided by a large language model (LLM), the activity obfuscated its behavior within an SVG file, leveraging business terminology and a synthetic structure to disguise its malicious intent,‚Äù the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team
said
in an analysis published last week. The activity, detected on August 28, 2025, shows how threat actors are increasingly adopting artificial intelligence (AI) tools into their workflows, often with the goal of crafting more convincing phishing lures, automating malware obfuscation, and generating code that mimics legitimate content. In the attack chain documented by the Windows maker, bad actors have been observed leveraging an already compromised business email account to send phishing messages to steal victims‚Äô credentials.</p>

<p>The messages feature lure masquerading as a file-sharing notification to entice them into opening what ostensibly appears to be a PDF document, but, in reality, is a Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file. What‚Äôs notable about the messages is that the attackers make use of a self-addressed email tactic, where the sender and recipient addresses match, and the actual targets were hidden in the BCC field so as to bypass basic detection heuristics. ‚ÄúSVG files (Scalable Vector Graphics) are
attractive
to attackers because they are text-based and scriptable, allowing them to embed JavaScript and other dynamic content directly within the file,‚Äù Microsoft said. ‚ÄúThis makes it possible to deliver interactive phishing payloads that appear benign to both users and many security tools.‚Äù
On top of that, the fact that SVG file format supports features such as invisible elements, encoded attributes, and delayed script execution makes it ideal for adversaries looking to sidestep static analysis and sandboxing, it added.</p>

<p>The SVG file, once launched, redirects the user to a page that serves a CAPTCHA for security verification, completing which, they are likely taken to a fake login page to harvest their credentials. Microsoft said the exact next stage is unclear due to its systems flagging and neutralizing the threat. But where the attack stands apart is when it comes to its unusual obfuscation approach that uses business-related language to disguise the phishing content in the SVG file ‚Äì a sign that it may have been generated using an LLM. ‚ÄúFirst, the beginning of the SVG code was structured to look like a legitimate business analytics dashboard,‚Äù Microsoft said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis tactic is designed to mislead anyone casually inspecting the file, making it appear as if the SVG‚Äôs sole purpose is to visualize business data. In reality, though, it‚Äôs a decoy.‚Äù
The second aspect is that the payload‚Äôs core functionality ‚Äì which is to redirect users to the initial phishing landing page, trigger browser fingerprinting, and initiate session tracking ‚Äì is also obscured using a long sequence of business-related terms such as revenue, operations, risk, quarterly, growth, or shares. Microsoft said it ran the code against its Security Copilot, which found that the program was ‚Äúnot something a human would typically write from scratch due to its complexity, verbosity, and lack of practical utility.‚Äù Some of the indicators it used to arrive at the conclusion include the use of -
Overly descriptive and redundant naming for functions and variables
Highly modular and over-engineered code structure
Generic and verbose comments
Formulaic techniques to achieve obfuscation using business terminology
CDATA and XML declaration in the SVG file, likely in an attempt to mimic documentation examples
‚ÄúWhile this campaign was limited in scope and effectively blocked, similar techniques are increasingly being leveraged by a range of threat actors,‚Äù Microsoft said. The disclosure comes as Forcepoint detailed a multi-stage attack sequence that uses phishing emails with .XLAM attachments to execute shellcode that ultimately deploys XWorm RAT by means of a secondary payload, while simultaneously displaying a blank or corrupted Office file as a ruse.</p>

<p>The secondary payload functions as a conduit to load a .DLL file in memory. ‚ÄúThe second stage .DLL file from memory uses heavily obfuscated packing and encryption techniques,‚Äù Forcepoint
said
. ‚ÄúThis second stage .DLL file loaded another .DLL file in memory again using reflective DLL injection which was further responsible for final execution of malware.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe next and final step performs a process injection in its own main executable file, maintaining persistence and exfiltrating data to its command-and-control servers. The C2s where data was exfiltrated was found to be related to XWorm family.‚Äù
In recent weeks, phishing attacks have also
employed
lures related to the U.S.</p>

<p>Social Security Administration and copyright infringement to distribute ScreenConnect ConnectWise and information stealers such as Lone None Stealer and PureLogs Stealer, respectively, per Cofense. ‚ÄúThe campaign typically spoofs various legal firms claiming to request the takedown of copyright-infringing content on the victim‚Äôs website or social media page,‚Äù the email security company
said
of the second set of attacks. ‚ÄúThis campaign is notable for its novel use of a Telegram bot profile page to deliver its initial payload, obfuscated compiled Python script payloads, and evolving complexity as seen through multiple iterations of campaign samples.‚Äù

<h2 id="first-malicious-mcp-server-found-stealing-emails-in-rogue-postmark-mcp-package"><a id="article-5"></a>First Malicious MCP Server Found Stealing Emails in Rogue Postmark-MCP Package</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have discovered what has been described as the first-ever instance of a malicious Model Context Protocol (
MCP
) server spotted in the wild, raising software supply chain risks. According to Koi Security, a legitimate-looking developer managed to slip in rogue code within an npm package called ‚Äú
postmark-mcp
‚Äú that copied an official Postmark Labs library of the same name. The malicious functionality was introduced in version 1.0.16, which was released on September 17, 2025. The actual ‚Äúpostmark-mcp‚Äù library,
available on GitHub
,
exposes an MCP server
to allow users to send emails, access and use email templates, and track campaigns using artificial intelligence (AI) assistants.</p>

<p>The npm package in question has since been deleted from npm by the developer ‚Äú
phanpak
,‚Äù who
uploaded
it to the repository on September 15, 2025, and maintains 31 other packages. The JavaScript library
attracted
a total of 1,643 downloads. ‚ÄúSince version 1.0.16, it‚Äôs been quietly copying every email to the developer‚Äôs personal server,‚Äù Koi Security Chief Technology Officer Idan Dardikman
said
. ‚ÄúThis is the world‚Äôs first sighting of a real-world malicious MCP server.</p>

<p>The attack surface for endpoint supply chain attacks is slowly becoming the enterprise‚Äôs biggest attack surface.‚Äù
The malicious package is a replica of the original library, save for a one-line change added in version 1.0.16 that essentially forwards every email sent using the MCP server to the email address ‚Äúphan@giftshop[.]club‚Äù by BCC‚Äôing it, potentially exposing sensitive communications. ‚ÄúThe postmark-mcp backdoor isn‚Äôt sophisticated ‚Äì it‚Äôs embarrassingly simple,‚Äù Dardikman said. ‚ÄúBut it perfectly demonstrates how completely broken this whole setup is. One developer.</p>

<p>One line of code. Thousands upon thousands of stolen emails.‚Äù
Developers who have installed the npm package are recommended to immediately remove it from their workflows, rotate any credentials that may have been exposed through email, and review email logs for BCC traffic to the reported domain. ‚ÄúMCP servers typically run with high trust and broad permissions inside agent toolchains. As such, any data they handle can be sensitive (password resets, invoices, customer communications, internal memos, etc.),‚Äù Snyk
said
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIn this case, the backdoor in this MCP Server was built with the intention to harvest and exfiltrate emails for agentic workflows that relied on this MCP Server.‚Äù
The findings illustrate how threat actors continue to abuse the user trust associated with the open-source ecosystem and the nascent MCP ecosystem to their advantage, especially when they are rolled out in business critical environments without adequate guardrails.

<h2 id="the-roi-of-ai-in-the-soc-what-security-teams-are-seeing"><a id="article-6"></a>The ROI of AI in the SOC: What Security Teams Are Seeing</h2>

<h2 id="china-linked-plugx-and-bookworm-malware-attacks-target-asian-telecom-and-asean-networks"><a id="article-7"></a>China-Linked PlugX and Bookworm Malware Attacks Target Asian Telecom and ASEAN Networks</h2>

<p>Telecommunications and manufacturing sectors in Central and South Asian countries have emerged as the target of an ongoing campaign distributing a new variant of a known malware called
PlugX
(aka Korplug or SOGU). ‚ÄúThe new variant‚Äôs features overlap with both the
RainyDay
and
Turian
backdoors, including abuse of the same legitimate applications for DLL side-loading, the XOR-RC4-RtlDecompressBuffer algorithm used to encrypt/decrypt payloads and the RC4 keys used,‚Äù Cisco Talos researchers Joey Chen and Takahiro Takeda
said
in an analysis published this week. The cybersecurity company noted that the configuration associated with the PlugX variant diverges significantly from the usual PlugX configuration format, instead adopting the same structure used in
RainyDay
, a backdoor associated with a China-linked threat actor known as
Lotus Panda
(aka Naikon APT). It‚Äôs also likely tracked by Kaspersky as
FoundCore
and attributed to a Chinese-speaking threat group it calls Cycldek.</p>

<p>PlugX is a modular remote access trojan (RAT) widely used by
many China-aligned hacking
groups, but most prominently by
Mustang Panda
(aka BASIN, Bronze President, Camaro Dragon, Earth Preta, HoneyMyte, RedDelta, Red Lich, Stately Taurus, TEMP.Hex, and Twill Typhoon). Turian
(aka Quarian or Whitebird), on the other hand, is assessed to be a backdoor exclusively employed in cyber attacks targeting the Middle East by another advanced persistent threat (APT) group with ties to China referred to as
BackdoorDiplomacy
(aka
CloudComputating
or Faking Dragon). The victimology patterns ‚Äì particularly the focus on telecommunications companies ‚Äì and technical malware implementation had yielded evidence suggesting likely connections between Lotus Panda and BackdoorDiplomacy, raising the possibility that either the two clusters are one and the same, or that they are obtaining their tools from a common vendor. In one incident detected by the company, Naikon is said to have targeted a telecom firm in Kazakhstan, a country that shares its borders with Uzbekistan, which has been previously singled out by BackdoorDiplomacy.</p>

<p>What‚Äôs more, both hacking crews have been found to zero in on South Asian countries. The attack chains essentially involve abusing a legitimate executable associated with Mobile Popup Application to sideload a malicious DLL that‚Äôs then used to decrypt and launch PlugX, RainyDay, and Turian payloads in memory. Recent attack waves orchestrated by the threat actor have heavily leaned on PlugX, which uses the same configuration structure as RainyDay and includes an embedded keylogger plugin. ‚ÄúWhile we cannot conclude that there is a clear connection between Naikon and BackdoorDiplomacy, there are significant overlapping aspects ‚Äì such as the choice of targets, encryption/decryption payload methods, encryption key reuse and use of tools supported by the same vendor,‚Äù Talos said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThese similarities suggest a medium confidence link to a Chinese-speaking actor in this campaign.‚Äù
Mustang Panda‚Äôs Bookworm Malware Detailed
The disclosure comes as Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 sheds light on the inner workings of the Bookworm malware used by the Mustang Panda actor
since 2015
to gain extensive control over compromised systems. The advanced RAT comes fitted with capabilities to execute arbitrary commands, upload/download files, exfiltrate data, and establish persistent access. Earlier this March, the cybersecurity vendor
said
it identified attacks targeting countries affiliated with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to distribute the malware. Bookworm utilizes legitimate-looking domains or compromised infrastructure for C2 purposes so as to blend in with normal network traffic.</p>

<p>Select variants of the malware have also been found to share overlaps with
TONESHELL
, a known backdoor associated with Mustang Pana since late 2022. Like PlugX and TONESHELL, attack chains distributing Bookworm rely on DLL side-loading for payload execution, although newer variants have embraced a technique that involves packaging shellcode as universally unique identifier (UUID) strings, which are then decoded and executed. ‚ÄúBookworm is known for its unique modular architecture, allowing its core functionality to be expanded by loading additional modules directly from its command-and-control (C2) server,‚Äù Unit 42 researcher Kyle Wilhoit
said
. ‚ÄúThis modularity makes static analysis more challenging, as the Leader module relies on other DLLs to provide specific functionality.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis deployment and adaptation of Bookworm, running in parallel with other Stately Taurus operations, showcases its long-term role in the actor‚Äôs arsenal.</p>

<p>It also points to a sustained, long-term commitment to its development and use by the group.‚Äù

<h2 id="researchers-expose-phishing-threats-distributing-countloader-and-purerat"><a id="article-8"></a>Researchers Expose Phishing Threats Distributing CountLoader and PureRAT</h2>

<p>A new campaign has been observed impersonating Ukrainian government agencies in phishing attacks to deliver
CountLoader
, which is then used to drop
Amatera Stealer
and
PureMiner
. ‚ÄúThe phishing emails contain malicious Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files designed to trick recipients into opening harmful attachments,‚Äù Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Yurren Wan
said
in a report shared with The Hacker News. In the attack chains documented by the cybersecurity company, the SVG files are used to initiate the download of a password-protected ZIP archive, which contains a Compiled HTML Help (CHM) file. The CHM file, when launched, activates a chain of events that culminate in the deployment of CountLoader.</p>

<p>The email messages claim to be a notice from the National Police of Ukraine. CountLoader, which was the subject of a
recent analysis
by Silent Push, has been found to drop various payloads like Cobalt Strike, AdaptixC2, and PureHVNC RAT. In this attack chain, however, it serves as a distribution vector for
Amatera Stealer
, a variant of ACRStealer, and PureMiner, a stealthy .NET cryptocurrency miner. It‚Äôs worth pointing out that both PureHVNC RAT and PureMiner are part of a broader malware suite developed by a threat actor known as PureCoder.</p>

<p>Some of the other products from the same author include -
PureCrypter, a crypter for Native and .NET
PureRAT (aka ResolverRAT), a successor to PureHVNC RAT
PureLogs, an information stealer and logger
BlueLoader, a malware that can act as a botnet by downloading and executing payloads remotely
PureClipper, a clipper malware that substitutes cryptocurrency addresses copied into the clipboard with attacker-controlled wallet addresses to redirect transactions and steal funds
According to Fortinet, Amatera Stealer and PureMiner are both deployed as fileless threats, with the malware ‚Äúexecuted via .NET Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation with process hollowing or loaded directly into memory using PythonMemoryModule.‚Äù
Amatera Stealer, once launched, gathers system information, collects files matching a predefined list of extensions, and harvests data from Chromium- and Gecko-based browsers, as well as applications like Steam, Telegram, FileZilla, and various cryptocurrency wallets. ‚ÄúThis phishing campaign demonstrates how a malicious SVG file can act as an HTML substitute to initiate an infection chain,‚Äù Fortinet said. In this case, attackers targeted Ukrainian government entities with emails containing SVG attachments. The SVG-embedded HTML code redirected victims to a download site.‚Äù
The development comes as Huntress uncovered a likely Vietnamese-speaking threat group using phishing emails bearing copyright infringement notice themes to trick recipients into launching ZIP archives that lead to the deployment of
PXA Stealer
, which then evolves into a multi-layered infection sequence dropping PureRAT.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis campaign demonstrates a clear and deliberate progression, starting with a simple phishing lure and escalating through layers of in-memory loaders, defense evasion, and credential theft,‚Äù security researcher James Northey
said
. ‚ÄúThe final payload, PureRAT, represents the culmination of this effort: a modular, professionally developed backdoor that gives the attacker complete control over a compromised host.‚Äù
‚ÄúTheir progression from amateurish obfuscation of their Python payloads to abusing commodity malware like PureRAT shows not just persistence, but also hallmarks of a serious and maturing operator.‚Äù

<h2 id="new-coldriver-malware-campaign-joins-bo-team-and-bearlyfy-in-russia-focused-cyberattacks"><a id="article-9"></a>New COLDRIVER Malware Campaign Joins BO Team and Bearlyfy in Russia-Focused Cyberattacks</h2>

<p>The Russian advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as COLDRIVER has been attributed to a fresh round of ClickFix-style attacks designed to deliver two new ‚Äúlightweight‚Äù malware families tracked as BAITSWITCH and SIMPLEFIX. Zscaler ThreatLabz, which
detected
the new multi-stage ClickFix campaign earlier this month, described BAITSWITCH as a downloader that ultimately drops SIMPLEFIX, a PowerShell backdoor. COLDRIVER
, also tracked as Callisto, Star Blizzard, and UNC4057, is the moniker assigned to a Russia-linked threat actor that‚Äôs known to target a wide range of sectors since 2019. While early campaign waves were observed using spear-phishing lures to direct targets to credential harvesting pages, the group has been fleshing out its arsenal with custom tools like
SPICA
and
LOSTKEYS
, which underscores its technical sophistication.</p>

<p>The adversary‚Äôs use of ClickFix tactics was previously documented by the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) back in May 2025, using fake sites serving fake CAPTCHA verification prompts to trick the victim into executing a PowerShell command that‚Äôs designed to deliver the LOSTKEYS Visual Basic Script. ‚ÄúThe continued use of ClickFix suggests that it is an effective infection vector, even if it is neither novel nor technically advanced,‚Äù Zscaler security researchers Sudeep Singh and Yin Hong Chang said in a report published this week. The latest attack chain follows the same modus operandi, tricking unsuspecting users into running a malicious DLL in the Windows Run dialog under the guise of completing a CAPTCHA check. The DLL, BAITSWITCH, reaches out to an attacker-controlled domain (‚Äúcaptchanom[.]top‚Äù) to fetch the SIMPLEFIX backdoor, while a decoy document hosted on Google Drive is presented to the victims.</p>

<p>It also makes several HTTP requests to the same server to send system information, receive commands to establish persistence, store encrypted payloads in the Windows Registry, download a PowerShell stager, clear the most recent command executed in the Run dialog, effectively erasing traces of the ClickFix attack that triggered the infection. The downloaded PowerShell stager subsequently reaches out to an external server (‚Äúsouthprovesolutions[.]com‚Äù) to download SIMPLEFIX, which, in turn, establishes communication with a command-and-control (C2) server to run PowerShell scripts, commands, and binaries hosted on remote URLs. One of the PowerShell scripts executed via SIMPLEFIX exfiltrates information about a hard-coded list of file types found in a pre-configured list of directories. The list of directories and file extensions scanned shares overlaps with that of LOSTKEYS.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe COLDRIVER APT group is known for targeting members of NGOs, human right defenders, think tanks in Western regions, as well as individuals exiled from and residing in Russia,‚Äù Zscaler said. ‚ÄúThe focus of this campaign closely aligns with their victimology, which targets members of civil society connected to Russia.‚Äù
BO Team and Bearlyfy Target Russia
The development comes as Kaspersky said it observed a new phishing campaign targeting Russian companies in early September undertaken by the
BO Team
group (aka Black Owl, Hoody Hyena, and Lifting Zmiy) using password-protected RAR archives to deliver a new version of
BrockenDoor
rewritten in C# and an updated version of ZeronetKit. A Golang backdoor, ZeronetKit, comes fitted with capabilities to support remote access to compromised hosts, upload/download files, execute commands using cmd.exe, and create a TCP/IPv4 tunnel. Select newer versions also incorporate support for downloading and running shellcode, as well as update the communication interval with C2 and modify the C2 server list.</p>

<p>‚ÄúZeronetKit is unable to independently persist on an infected system, so attackers use BrockenDoor to copy the downloaded backdoor to startup,‚Äù the Russian cybersecurity vendor
said
. It also follows the emergence of a new group called Bearlyfy that has used ransomware strains like LockBit 3.0 and Babuk in attacks targeting Russia, initially attacking smaller companies for smaller ransoms before graduating to bigger firms in the country starting April 2025, according to F6. As of August 2025, the group is estimated to have claimed at least 30 victims. In one incident targeting a consulting company, the threat actors have been observed weaponizing a vulnerable version of Bitrix for initial access, followed by using the Zerologon flaw to escalate privileges.</p>

<p>In another case observed in July, the initial access is said to have been facilitated through an unnamed partner company. ‚ÄúIn the most recent recorded attack, the attackers demanded ‚Ç¨80,000 in cryptocurrency, while in the first attack, the ransom was several thousand dollars,‚Äù F6 researchers
said
. ‚ÄúDue to the relatively low ransom amounts, on average, every fifth victim buys decryptors from the attackers.‚Äù
Bearlyfy is assessed to be active since January 2025, with a deeper analysis of its tools uncovering infrastructure overlaps with a likely pro-Ukrainian threat group called
PhantomCore
, which has a track record of targeting Russian and Belarusian companies since 2022. Despite these similarities, Bearlyfy is believed to be an autonomous entity.</p>

<p>‚ÄúPhantomCore implements complex, multi-stage attacks typical of APT campaigns,‚Äù the company said. ‚ÄúBearlyfy, on the other hand, uses a different model: attacks with minimal preparation and a targeted focus on achieving an immediate effect. Initial access is achieved through exploitation of external services and vulnerable applications. The primary toolkit is aimed at encryption, destruction, or modification of data.‚Äù

<h2 id="crash-tests-for-security-why-bas-is-proof-of-defense-not-assumptions"><a id="article-10"></a>Crash Tests for Security: Why BAS Is Proof of Defense, Not Assumptions</h2>

<p>Car makers don‚Äôt trust blueprints. They smash prototypes into walls. Again and again. In controlled conditions.</p>

<p>Because design specs don‚Äôt prove survival. Crash tests do. They separate theory from reality. Cybersecurity is no different.</p>

<p>Dashboards overflow with ‚Äúcritical‚Äù exposure alerts. Compliance reports tick every box. But none of that proves what matters most to a CISO:
The ransomware crew targeting your sector can‚Äôt move laterally once inside. That a newly published exploit of a CVE won‚Äôt bypass your defenses tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>That sensitive data can‚Äôt be siphoned through a stealthy exfiltration channel, exposing the business to fines, lawsuits, and reputational damage. That‚Äôs why Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) matters. BAS is the crash test for your security stack. It safely simulates real adversarial behaviors to prove which attacks your defenses can stop, and which would break through.</p>

<p>It exposes those gaps before attackers exploit them or regulators demand answers. The Illusion of Safety: Dashboards Without Crash Tests
Dashboards overflowing with exposures can feel reassuring, like you‚Äôre seeing everything, like you‚Äôre safe. But it‚Äôs a false comfort. It‚Äôs no different than reading a car‚Äôs spec sheet and declaring it ‚Äúsafe‚Äù without ever crashing it into a wall at 60 miles per hour.</p>

<p>On paper, the design holds. In practice, impact reveals where the frame buckles and the airbags fail. The
Blue Report 2025
provides crash test data for enterprise security. Based on 160 million adversary simulations, it shows what actually happens when defenses are tested instead of assumed:
Prevention dropped from 69% to 62% in one year.</p>

<p>Even organizations with mature controls regressed. 54% of attacker behaviors generated no logs. Entire attack chains unfolded with zero visibility. Only 14% triggered alerts.</p>

<p>Meaning most detection pipelines failed silently. Data exfiltration was stopped just 3% of the time. A stage with direct financial, regulatory, and reputational consequences is effectively unprotected. These are not gaps dashboards reveal.</p>

<p>They are exploitable weaknesses that only appear under pressure. Just as a crash test exposes flaws hidden in design blueprints,
security validation exposes the assumptions that collapse under real-world impact, before attackers, regulators, or customers do. BAS Works as a Security Validation Engine
Crash tests don‚Äôt just expose flaws. They prove safety systems fire when they‚Äôre needed most.</p>

<p>Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) does the same for
enterprise security
. Instead of waiting for a real breach, BAS continuously runs safe, controlled attack scenarios that mirror how adversaries actually operate. It doesn‚Äôt trade in hypotheticals, it delivers proof. For CISOs, this proof matters because it turns anxiety into assurance:
No sleepless nights over a public CVE with a working proof-of-concept.</p>

<p>BAS shows if your defenses stop it in practice. No guessing whether the ransomware campaign sweeping your sector could penetrate your environment. BAS runs those behaviors safely and shows if you‚Äôd be a victim or not. No fear of the unknown in tomorrow‚Äôs threat reports.</p>

<p>BAS validates defenses against both known techniques and emerging ones observed in the wild. This is the discipline of
Security Control Validation (SCV):
proving that investments hold up where it counts. BAS is the engine that makes SCV continuous and scalable. Dashboards may show posture.</p>

<p>BAS reveals performance. By pointing out the blind spots in your defenses, it gives CISOs something dashboards never can: the ability to focus on the exposures that actually matter, and the confidence to prove resilience to boards, regulators, and customers. Proof in Action: Effect of BAS in Business Side
BAS-driven exposure validation shows just how much noise can be eliminated when assumptions give way to proof:
Backlogs of
9,500 CVSS ‚Äúcritical‚Äù findings
shrink to just
1,350 exposures proven relevant
. Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR)
drops from
45 days to 13
, closing windows of exposure before attackers can strike.</p>

<p>Rollbacks
fall from
11 per quarter to 2
, saving time, budget, and credibility. And when paired with prioritization models like the
Picus Exposure Score (PXS)
, the clarity becomes sharper:
From
63% of vulnerabilities flagged as high/critical
, only
10% remain truly critical
after validation, an
84% reduction in false urgency
. For CISOs, this means fewer sleepless nights over swelling dashboards and more confidence that resources are locked onto exposures that matter most. BAS turns overwhelming data into a validated risk picture executives can trust.</p>

<p>Closing Thought: Don‚Äôt Just Monitor, Simulate
For CISOs, the challenge isn‚Äôt visibility, it‚Äôs certainty. Boards don‚Äôt ask for dashboards or scanner scores. They want assurance that defenses will hold when it matters most. This is where BAS reframes the conversation: from posture to proof.</p>

<p>From ‚ÄúWe deployed a firewall‚Äù ‚Üí to ‚ÄúWe proved it blocked malicious C2 traffic across 500 simulated attempts this quarter.‚Äù
From ‚ÄúOur EDR has MITRE coverage‚Äù ‚Üí to ‚ÄúWe detected 72% of emulated Scattered Spider APT group‚Äôs behaviors; here‚Äôs where we fixed the other 28%.‚Äù
From ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre compliant‚Äù ‚Üí to ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre resilient, and we can prove it with evidence.‚Äù
That shift is why BAS resonates at the executive level. It transforms security from assumptions into measurable outcomes. Boards don‚Äôt buy posture, they buy proof. And BAS is evolving further.</p>

<p>With AI, it‚Äôs no longer just proving whether defenses worked yesterday, but anticipating how they will hold tomorrow. To see this in action, join
Picus Security, SANS, Hacker Valley, and other leading voices

<h2 id="fortra-goanywhere-cvss-10-flaw-exploited-as-0-day-a-week-before-public-disclosure"><a id="article-11"></a>Fortra GoAnywhere CVSS 10 Flaw Exploited as 0-Day a Week Before Public Disclosure</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity company watchTowr Labs has disclosed that it has ‚Äúcredible evidence‚Äù of active exploitation of the recently disclosed security flaw in Fortra GoAnywhere Managed File Transfer (MFT) software as early as September 10, 2025, a whole week before it was publicly disclosed. ‚ÄúThis is not ‚Äòjust‚Äô a CVSS 10.0 flaw in a solution long favored by APT groups and ransomware operators ‚Äì it is a vulnerability that has been actively exploited in the wild since at least September 10, 2025,‚Äù Benjamin Harris, CEO and Founder of watchTowr, told The Hacker News. The vulnerability in question is
CVE-2025-10035
, which has been described as a deserialization vulnerability in the License Servlet that could result in command injection without authentication. Fortra GoAnywhere version 7.8.4, or the Sustain Release 7.6.3, was released by Fortra last week to remediate the problem.</p>

<p>According to an
analysis
released by watchTowr earlier this week, the vulnerability has to do with the fact that it‚Äôs possible to send a crafted HTTP GET request to the ‚Äú/goanywhere/license/Unlicensed.xhtml/‚Äù endpoint to directly interact with the License Servlet (‚Äúcom.linoma.ga.ui.admin.servlet.LicenseResponseServlet‚Äù) that‚Äôs exposed at ‚Äú/goanywhere/lic/accept/<GUID>" using the GUID embedded in the response to the earlier sent request. Armed with this authentication bypass, an attacker can take advantage of inadequate deserialization protections in the License Servlet to result in command injection. That said, exactly how this occurs is something of a mystery, researchers Sonny Macdonald and Piotr Bazydlo noted. Cybersecurity vendor Rapid7, which also
released
its findings into CVE-2025-10035, said it's not a single deserialization vulnerability, but rather a chain of three separate issues -
An access control bypass that has been known since 2023
The unsafe deserialization vulnerability CVE-2025-10035, and
An as-yet unknown issue pertaining to how the attackers can know a specific private key
In a subsequent report
published
Thursday, watchTowr said it received evidence of exploitation efforts, including a stack trace, that enables the creation of a backdoor account.</GUID></p>

<p>The sequence of the activity is as follows -
Triggering the pre-authentication vulnerability in Fortra GoAnywhere MFT to achieve remote code execution (RCE)
Using the RCE to create a GoAnywhere user named ‚Äúadmin-go‚Äù
Using the newly created account to create a web user
Leveraging the web user to interact with the solution and upload and execute additional payloads, including SimpleHelp and an unknown implant (‚Äúzato_be.exe‚Äù)
The cybersecurity company also said the threat actor activity originated from the IP address
155.2.190[.]197
, which, according to
VirusTotal
, has been flagged for conducting brute-force attacks targeting Fortinet FortiGate SSL VPN appliances in early August 2025. However, watchTowr told The Hacker News that it has not observed any such activity from the IP address against its honeypots. Given signs of in-the-wild exploitation, it‚Äôs imperative that users move quickly to apply the fixes, if not already. The Hacker News has reached out to Fortra for comment, and we will update the story if we hear back.</p>

<h2 id="new-macos-xcsset-variant-targets-firefox-with-clipper-and-persistence-module"><a id="article-12"></a>New macOS XCSSET Variant Targets Firefox with Clipper and Persistence Module</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have discovered an updated version of a known Apple macOS malware called
XCSSET
that has been observed in limited attacks. ‚ÄúThis new variant of XCSSET brings key changes related to browser targeting, clipboard hijacking, and persistence mechanisms,‚Äù the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team
said
in a Thursday report. ‚ÄúIt employs sophisticated encryption and obfuscation techniques, uses run-only compiled AppleScripts for stealthy execution, and expands its data exfiltration capabilities to include Firefox browser data. It also adds another persistence mechanism through LaunchDaemon entries.‚Äù
XCSSET is the name assigned to a sophisticated modular malware that‚Äôs designed to infect Xcode projects used by software developers and unleash its malicious capabilities when it‚Äôs being built.</p>

<p>Exactly how the malware is distributed remains unclear, but it‚Äôs suspected that the propagation relies on the Xcode project files being shared among developers building apps for macOS. Earlier this March, Microsoft
uncovered
several enhancements to the malware, highlighting its improved error handling and the use of three different persistence techniques to siphon sensitive data from compromised hosts. The latest variant of XCSSET has been found to incorporate a clipper sub-module that monitors clipboard content for specific regular expression (aka regex) patterns matching various cryptocurrency wallets. In the event of a match, the malware proceeds to substitute the wallet address in the clipboard with an attacker-controlled one to reroute transactions.</p>

<p>The Windows maker also noted that the new iteration introduces changes to the fourth stage of the infection chain, particularly where an AppleScript application is used to run a shell command to fetch the final-stage AppleScript that‚Äôs responsible for collecting system information and launching various sub-modules using a boot() function. Notably, the modifications include extra checks for the Mozilla Firefox browser and an altered logic to determine the presence of the Telegram messaging app. Also observed are changes to the various modules, as well as new modules that did not exist in previous versions -
vexyeqj, the information module previously called seizecj, and which downloads a module called bnk that‚Äôs run using osascript. The script defines functions for data validation, encryption, decryption, fetching additional data from command-and-control (C2) server, and logging.</p>

<p>It also includes the clipper functionality. neq_cdyd_ilvcmwx, a module similar to txzx_vostfdi that exfiltrates files to the C2 server
xmyyeqjx, a module to set up LaunchDaemon-based persistence
jey, the module previously called jez, and which is used to set up Git-based persistence
iewmilh_cdyd, a module to steal data from Firefox using a modified version of a publicly available tool named
HackBrowserData
To mitigate the threat posed by XCSSET, users are recommended to ensure that they keep their system up-to-date, inspect Xcode projects downloaded or cloned from repositories or other sources, and exercise caution when it comes to copying and pasting sensitive data from the clipboard. Sherrod DeGrippo, Director of Threat Intelligence Strategy at Microsoft, told The Hacker News that the modules regularly undergo small name changes as the malware evolves, despite its functionality remaining consistent. ‚ÄúWhat stands out in this variant is its ability to intercept and tamper with clipboard content tied to digital wallets,‚Äù DeGrippo said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt passive reconnaissance; it‚Äôs a threat that will undermine trust in something as basic as what you copy and paste. ‚ÄúThe latest XCSSET evolution shows how even developer tools can be weaponized. With tactics like clipboard hijacking, expanded browser targeting, and stealth persistence, threat actors continue to raise the level of sophistication defenders need to guard against.‚Äù

<h2 id="cisco-asa-firewall-zero-day-exploits-deploy-rayinitiator-and-line-viper-malware"><a id="article-13"></a>Cisco ASA Firewall Zero-Day Exploits Deploy RayInitiator and LINE VIPER Malware</h2>

<p>The U.K. National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has revealed that threat actors have exploited the
recently disclosed security flaws
impacting Cisco firewalls as part of zero-day attacks to deliver previously undocumented malware families like
RayInitiator
and
LINE VIPER
. ‚ÄúThe RayInitiator and LINE VIPER malware represent a significant evolution on that used in the previous campaign, both in sophistication and its ability to evade detection,‚Äù the agency
said
. Cisco on Thursday revealed that it began investigating attacks on multiple government agencies linked to the state-sponsored campaign in May 2025 that targeted Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) 5500-X Series devices to implant malware, execute commands, and potentially exfiltrate data from the compromised devices.</p>

<p>An in-depth analysis of firmware extracted from the infected devices running Cisco Secure Firewall ASA Software with VPN web services enabled ultimately led to the discovery of a memory corruption bug in the product software, it added. ‚ÄúAttackers were observed to have exploited multiple zero-day vulnerabilities and employed advanced evasion techniques such as disabling logging, intercepting CLI commands, and intentionally crashing devices to prevent diagnostic analysis,‚Äù the company
said
. The activity involves the
exploitation
of CVE-2025-20362 (CVSS score: 6.5) and CVE-2025-20333 (CVSS score: 9.9) to bypass authentication and execute malicious code on susceptible appliances. The campaign is assessed to be linked to a threat cluster dubbed
ArcaneDoor
, which was attributed to a suspected China-linked hacking group known as UAT4356 (aka Storm-1849).</p>

<p>Additionally, in some cases, the threat actor is said to have
modified
ROMMON (short for
Read-Only Memory Monitor
) ‚Äì which is responsible for managing the boot process and performing diagnostic tests in ASA devices ‚Äì to facilitate persistence across reboots and software upgrades. That being said, these modifications have been detected only on Cisco ASA 5500-X Series platforms that lack Secure Boot and Trust Anchor technologies. Cisco also said the campaign has successfully compromised ASA 5500-X Series models running Cisco ASA Software releases 9.12 or 9.14 with VPN web services enabled, and which do not support Secure Boot and Trust Anchor technologies. All the affected devices have reached end-of-support (EoS) or are about to reach EoS status by next week -
5512-X and 5515-X ‚Äì Last Date of Support: August 31, 2022
5585-X ‚Äì Last Date of Support: May 31, 2023
5525-X, 5545-X, and 5555-X ‚Äì Last Date of Support: September 30, 2025
Furthermore, the company noted that it has addressed a third critical flaw (CVE-2025-20363, CVSS score: 8.5/9.0) in the web services of Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software, Secure Firewall Threat Defense (FTD) Software, IOS Software, IOS XE Software, and IOS XR Software that could allow an remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAn attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to a targeted web service on an affected device after obtaining additional information about the system, overcoming exploit mitigations, or both,‚Äù it
said
. ‚ÄúA successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as root, which may lead to the complete compromise of the affected device.‚Äù
Unlike CVE-2025-20362 and CVE-2025-20333, there is no evidence that the vulnerability has been exploited in the wild in a malicious context. Cisco said the shortcoming was discovered by the Cisco Advanced Security Initiatives Group (ASIG) during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case. The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security has
urged
organizations in the country to take action as soon as possible to counter the threat by updating to a fixed version of Cisco ASA and FTD products.</p>

<p>The U.K. NCSC, in an advisory released September 25, revealed the attacks have leveraged a multi-stage bootkit called RayInitiator to deploy a user-mode shellcode loader known as LINE VIPER to the ASA appliance. RayInitiator is a persistent GRand Unified Bootloader (GRUB) bootkit that‚Äôs flashed to victim devices, while capable of surviving reboots and firmware upgrades. It‚Äôs responsible for loading into memory LINE VIPER, which can run CLI commands, perform packet captures, bypass VPN Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) for actor devices, suppress syslog messages, harvest user CLI commands, and force a delayed reboot.</p>

<p>The bootkit accomplishes this by installing a handler within a legitimate ASA binary called ‚Äúlina‚Äù to execute LINE VIPER. Lina, short for Linux-based Integrated Network Architecture, is the operating system software that integrates core firewall functionalities of the ASA. Described as ‚Äúmore comprehensive‚Äù than
Line Dancer
, LINE VIPER uses two methods for communication with the command-and-control (C2) server: WebVPN client authentication sessions over HTTPS, or via ICMP with responses over raw TCP. It‚Äôs also designed to make a number of modifications to ‚Äúlina‚Äù to avoid leaving a forensic trail and prevent detection of modifications to CLI commands like copy and verify.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe deployment of LINE VIPER via a persistent bootkit, combined with a greater emphasis on defence evasion techniques, demonstrates an increase in actor sophistication and improvement in operational security compared to the ArcaneDoor campaign publicly documented in 2024,‚Äù the NCSC said.
