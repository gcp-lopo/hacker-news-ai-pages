<h2 id="sonicwall-fixes-actively-exploited-cve-2025-40602-in-sma-100-appliances"><a id="article-1"></a>SonicWall Fixes Actively Exploited CVE-2025-40602 in SMA 100 Appliances</h2>

<p>SonicWall has rolled out fixes to
address
a security flaw in Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 100 series appliances that it said has been actively exploited in the wild. The vulnerability, tracked as
CVE-2025-40602
(CVSS score: 6.6), concerns a case of local privilege escalation that arises as a result of insufficient authorization in the appliance management console (AMC). It affects the following versions -
12.4.3-03093 (platform-hotfix) and earlier versions - Fixed in 12.4.3-03245 (platform-hotfix)
12.5.0-02002 (platform-hotfix) and earlier versions - Fixed in 12.5.0-02283 (platform-hotfix)
“This vulnerability was reported to be leveraged in combination with
CVE-2025-23006
(CVSS score 9.8) to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution with root privileges,” SonicWall said. It’s worth noting that CVE-2025-23006 was patched by the company in late January 2025 in version 12.4.3-02854 (platform-hotfix).</p>

<p>Clément Lecigne and Zander Work of Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) have been credited with discovering and reporting CVE-2025-40602. There are currently no details on the scale of the attacks and who is behind the efforts. Back in July, Google
said
it’s tracking a cluster named UNC6148 that’s targeting fully-patched end-of-life SonicWall SMA 100 series devices as part of a campaign designed to drop a backdoor called OVERSTEP. It’s currently not clear if these activities are related.</p>

<p>In light of active exploitation, it’s essential that SonicWall SMA 100 series users apply the fixes as soon as possible. Found this article interesting? Follow us on

<h2 id="kimwolf-botnet-hijacks-18-million-android-tvs-launches-large-scale-ddos-attacks"><a id="article-2"></a>Kimwolf Botnet Hijacks 1.8 Million Android TVs, Launches Large-Scale DDoS Attacks</h2>

<p>A new distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnet known as
Kimwolf
has enlisted a massive army of no less than 1.8 million infected devices comprising Android-based TVs, set-top boxes, and tablets, and may be associated with another botnet known as
AISURU
, according to findings from QiAnXin XLab. “Kimwolf is a botnet compiled using the
NDK
[Native Development Kit],” the company
said
in a report published today. “In addition to typical DDoS attack capabilities, it integrates proxy forwarding, reverse shell, and file management functions.”
The hyper-scale botnet is estimated to have issued 1.7 billion DDoS attack commands within a three-day period between November 19 and 22, 2025, around the same time one of its command-and-control (C2) domains – 14emeliaterracewestroxburyma02132[.]su –
came first
in Cloudflare’s list of top 100 domains, briefly even surpassing Google. Kimwolf’s primary infection targets are TV boxes deployed in residential network environments.</p>

<p>Some of the affected device models include TV BOX, SuperBOX, HiDPTAndroid, P200, X96Q, XBOX, SmartTV, and MX10. Infections are scattered globally, with Brazil, India, the U.S., Argentina, South Africa, and the Philippines registering higher concentrations. That said, the exact means by which the malware is propagated to these devices is presently unclear. XLab said its investigation into the botnet commenced after it received a “version 4” artifact of Kimwolf from a trusted community partner on October 24, 2025.</p>

<p>Since then, an additional eight samples were discovered last month. “We observed that Kimwolf’s C2 domains have been successfully taken down by unknown parties at least three times [in December], forcing it to upgrade its tactics and turn to using ENS (Ethereum Name Service) to harden its infrastructure, demonstrating its powerful evolutionary capability,” XLab researchers said. That’s not all. Earlier this month, XLab managed to successfully seize control of one of the C2 domains, enabling it to assess the scale of the botnet.</p>

<p>An interesting aspect of Kimwolf is that it’s tied to the infamous AISURU botnet, which has been behind some of the record-breaking DDoS attacks over the past year. It’s suspected that the attackers reused code from AISURU in the early stages, before opting to develop the Kimwolf botnet to evade detection. XLab said it’s possible some of these attacks may not have come from AISURU alone, and that Kimwolf may be either participating or even leading the efforts. “These two major botnets propagated through the same infection scripts between September and November, coexisting in the same batch of devices,” the company said.</p>

<p>“They actually belong to the same hacker group.”
This assessment is based on
similarities
in APK packages uploaded to the VirusTotal platform, in
some cases
even using the
same code signing certificate
(“John Dinglebert Dinglenut VIII VanSack Smith”). Further definitive evidence arrived on December 8, 2025, with the discovery of an active downloader server (“93.95.112[.]59”) that contained a script referencing APKs for both Kimwolf and AISURU. The malware in itself is fairly straightforward. Once launched, it ensures that only one instance of the process runs on the infected device, and then proceeds to decrypt the embedded C2 domain, uses DNS-over-TLS to obtain the C2 IP address, and connects to it in order to receive and execute commands.</p>

<p>Recent versions of the botnet malware detected as recently as December 12, 2025, have introduced a technique known as
EtherHiding
that makes use of an ENS domain (“pawsatyou[.]eth”) to fetch the actual C2 IP from the associated smart contract (
0xde569B825877c47fE637913eCE5216C644dE081F
) in an effort to render its infrastructure more resilient to takedown efforts. Specifically, this involves extracting an IPv6 address from the
“lol” field of the transaction
, then taking the last four bytes of the address and performing an XOR operation with the key “0x93141715” to get the actual IP address. Besides encrypting sensitive data related to C2 servers and DNS resolvers, Kimwolf uses TLS encryption for network communications to receive DDoS commands. In all, the malware supports 13 DDoS attack methods over UDP, TCP, and ICMP.</p>

<p>The attack targets, per XLab, are located in the U.S., China, France, Germany, and Canada. Further analysis has determined that over 96% of the commands relate to using the bot nodes for providing proxy services. This indicates the attackers’ attempts to exploit the bandwidth from compromised devices and maximize profit. As part of the effort, a Rust-based Command Client module is deployed to form a proxy network.</p>

<p>Also delivered to the nodes is a ByteConnect software development kit (SDK), a monetization solution that allows app developers and IoT device owners to monetize their traffic. “Giant botnets originated with Mirai in 2016, with infection targets mainly concentrated on IoT devices like home broadband routers and cameras,” XLab said. “However, in recent years, information on multiple million-level giant botnets like Badbox, Bigpanzi, Vo1d, and Kimwolf has been disclosed, indicating that some attackers have started to turn their attention to various smart TVs and TV boxes.”

<h2 id="apt28-targets-ukrainian-ukr-net-users-in-long-running-credential-phishing-campaign"><a id="article-3"></a>APT28 Targets Ukrainian UKR-net Users in Long-Running Credential Phishing Campaign</h2>

<p>The Russian state-sponsored threat actor known as
APT28
has been attributed to what has been described as a “sustained” credential-harvesting campaign targeting users of UKR[.]net, a webmail and news service popular in Ukraine. The activity, observed by Recorded Future’s Insikt Group between June 2024 and April 2025, builds upon
prior findings
from the cybersecurity company in May 2024 that detailed the hacking group’s attacks targeting European networks with the HeadLace malware and credential-harvesting web pages. APT28 is also tracked as BlueDelta, Fancy Bear, Forest Blizzard, FROZENLAKE, Iron Twilight, ITG05, Pawn Storm, Sednit, Sofacy, and TA422. It’s assessed to be affiliated with Russia’s Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Federation’s Armed Forces (GRU).</p>

<p>The latest attacks are characterized by the deployment of UKR[.]net-themed login pages on legitimate services like Mocky to entice recipients into entering their credentials and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes. Links to these pages are embedded within PDF documents that are distributed via phishing emails. The links are shortened using services like tiny[.]cc or tinyurl[.]com. In some cases, the threat actor has also been observed using subdomains created on platforms like Blogger (*.blogspot[.]com) to launch a two-tier redirection chain that leads to the credential harvesting page.</p>

<p>The efforts are part of a broader set of phishing and credential theft operations orchestrated by the adversary since mid-2000s targeting government institutions, defense contractors, weapons suppliers, logistics firms, and policy think tanks in pursuit of Russia’s strategic objectives. “While this campaign does not reveal specific targets, BlueDelta’s historical focus on credential theft to enable intelligence collection provides strong indicators of likely intent to collect sensitive information from Ukrainian users in support of broader GRU intelligence requirements,” the Mastercard-owned company said in a report shared with The Hacker News. What has changed is the transition from using compromised routers to proxy tunneling services such as ngrok and Serveo to capture and relay the stolen credentials and 2FA codes. “BlueDelta’s continued abuse of free hosting and anonymized tunneling infrastructure likely reflects an adaptive response to
Western-led infrastructure takedowns
in early 2024,” Recorded Future said.</p>

<p>“The campaign highlights the GRU’s persistent interest in compromising Ukrainian user credentials to support intelligence-gathering operations amid Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine.”

<h2 id="new-forumtroll-phishing-attacks-target-russian-scholars-using-fake-elibrary-emails"><a id="article-4"></a>New ForumTroll Phishing Attacks Target Russian Scholars Using Fake eLibrary Emails</h2>

<p>The threat actor linked to
Operation ForumTroll
has been attributed to a fresh set of phishing attacks targeting individuals within Russia, according to Kaspersky. The Russian cybersecurity vendor said it detected the new activity in October 2025. The origins of the threat actor are presently unknown. “While the spring cyberattacks focused on organizations, the fall campaign honed in on specific individuals: scholars in the field of political science, international relations, and global economics, working at major Russian universities and research institutions,” security researcher Georgy Kucherin
said
.</p>

<p>Operation ForumTroll
refers
to a series of sophisticated phishing attacks exploiting a then-zero-day vulnerability in Google Chrome (CVE-2025-2783) to deliver the LeetAgent backdoor and a spyware implant known as Dante. The latest attack wave also commences with emails that claimed to be from eLibrary, a Russian scientific electronic library, with the messages sent from the address “support@e-library[.]wiki.” The domain was registered in March 2025, six months before the start of the campaign, suggesting that preparations for the attack had been underway for some time. Kaspersky said the
strategic domain aging
was done to avoid raising any red flags typically associated with sending emails from a freshly registered domain. In addition, the attackers also hosted a copy of the legitimate eLibrary homepage (“elibrary[.]ru”) on the bogus domain to maintain the ruse.</p>

<p>The emails instruct prospective targets to click on an embedded link pointing to the malicious site to download a plagiarism report. Should a victim follow through, a ZIP archive with the naming pattern “<LastName>_<FirstName>_<Patronymic>.zip" is downloaded to their machine. What's more, these links are designed for one-time use, meaning any subsequent attempts to navigate to the URL cause it to display a Russian language message stating "Download failed, please try again later." In the event, the download is attempted from a platform other than Windows, the user is prompted to "try again later on a Windows computer."
"The attackers also carefully personalized the phishing emails for their targets, specific professionals in the field," the company said. "The downloaded archive was named with the victim's last name, first name, and patronymic."
The archive contains a Windows shortcut (LNK) with the same name, which, when executed, runs a PowerShell script to download and launch a PowerShell-based payload from a remote server.</Patronymic></FirstName></LastName></p>

<p>The payload then contacts a URL to fetch a final-stage DLL and persist it using COM hijacking. It also downloads and displays a decoy PDF to the victim. The final payload is a command-and-control (C2) and red teaming framework known as
Tuoni
, enabling the threat actors to gain remote access to the victim’s Windows device. “ForumTroll has been targeting organizations and individuals in Russia and Belarus since at least 2022,” Kaspersky said.</p>

<p>“Given this lengthy timeline, it is likely this APT group will continue to target entities and individuals of interest within these two countries.”
The disclosure comes as Positive Technologies
detailed
the activities of two threat clusters,
QuietCrabs
– a suspected Chinese hacking group also tracked as UTA0178 and UNC5221 – and
Thor
, which appears to be involved in ransomware attacks since May 2025. These intrusion sets have been found to leverage security flaws in Microsoft SharePoint (
CVE-2025-53770
), Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (
CVE-2025-4427 and CVE-2025-4428
), Ivanti Connect Secure (
CVE-2024-21887
), and Ivanti Sentry (
CVE-2023-38035
). Attacks carried out by QuietCrabs take advantage of the initial access to deploy an ASPX web shell and use it to deliver a JSP loader that’s capable of downloading and executing
KrustyLoader
, which then drops the
Sliver
implant. “Thor is a threat group first observed in attacks against Russian companies in 2025,” researchers Alexander Badayev, Klimentiy Galkin, and Vladislav Lunin said.</p>

<p>“As final payloads, the attackers use LockBit and Babuk ransomware, as well as Tactical RMM and MeshAgent to maintain persistence.”

<h2 id="fix-soc-blind-spots-see-threats-to-your-industry--country-in-real-time"><a id="article-5"></a>Fix SOC Blind Spots: See Threats to Your Industry &amp; Country in Real Time</h2>

<p>Modern security teams often feel like they’re driving through fog with failing headlights. Threats accelerate, alerts multiply, and SOCs struggle to understand which dangers matter right now for their business. Breaking out of reactive defense is no longer optional. It’s the difference between preventing incidents and cleaning up after them.</p>

<p>Below is the path from reactive firefighting to a proactive, context-rich SOC that actually sees what’s coming. When the SOC Only Sees in the Rear-View Mirror
Many SOCs still rely on a backward-facing workflow. Analysts wait for an alert, investigate it, escalate, and eventually respond. This pattern is understandable: the job is noisy, the tooling is complex, and alert fatigue bends even the toughest teams into reactive mode.</p>

<p>But a reactive posture hides several structural problems:
No visibility into what threat actors are preparing. Limited ability to anticipate campaigns targeting the organization’s sector. Inability to adjust defenses before an attack hits. Overreliance on signatures that reflect yesterday’s activity.</p>

<p>The result is a SOC that constantly catches up but rarely gets ahead. The Cost of Waiting for the Alarm to Ring
Reactive SOCs pay in time, money, and risk. Longer investigations
. Analysts must research every suspicious object from scratch because they lack a broader context.</p>

<p>Wasted resources
. Without visibility into which threats are relevant to their vertical and geography, teams chase false positives instead of focusing on real dangers. Higher breach likelihood
. Threat actors often reuse infrastructure and target specific industries.</p>

<p>Seeing these patterns late gives attackers the advantage. A proactive SOC flips this script by reducing uncertainty. It knows which threats are circulating in its environment, what campaigns are active, and which alerts deserve immediate escalation. Threat Intelligence: The Engine of Proactive Security
Threat intelligence fills the gaps left by reactive operations.</p>

<p>It provides a stream of evidence about what attackers are doing right now and how their tools evolve. ANY.RUN’s
Threat Intelligence Lookup
serves as a tactical magnifying glass for SOCs. It converts raw threat data into an operational asset. TI Lookup: investigate threats and indicators, click search bar to select parameters

ANY.RUN’s
TI Feeds
complement SOC workflows by supplying continuously updated indicators gathered from real malware executions. This ensures defenses adapt at the speed of threat evolution.</p>

<p>Focus on Threats that Actually Matter to Your Business
But context alone isn’t enough; teams need to interpret this intelligence for their specific business environment. Threats are not evenly distributed across the world. Each sector and region has its own constellation of malware families, campaigns, and criminal groups. Companies from what industries and countries encounter Tycoon 2FA most often recently
Threat Intelligence Lookup supports industry and geographic attribution of threats and indicators thus helping SOCs answer vital questions:
Is this alert relevant to our company’s sector?</p>

<p>Is this malware known to target companies in our country? Are we seeing the early movements of a campaign aimed at organizations like ours? By mapping activity to both industry verticals and geographies, SOCs gain an immediate understanding of where a threat sits in their risk landscape. This reduces noise, speeds up triage, and lets teams focus on threats that truly demand action.</p>

<p>Focus your SOC on what truly matters. See which threats target your sector today
with TI Lookup
. Here is an example: a suspicious domain turns out to be linked to Lumma Stealer and ClickFix attacks targeting mostly telecom and hospitality businesses in the USA and Canada:
domainName:”benelui.click”
Industries and countries most targeted by threats the IOC is linked to
Or suppose a CISO in German manufacturing company wants a baseline for sector risks:
industry:”Manufacturing” and submissionCountry:”DE”
TI Lookup summary on malware samples analyzed by German users and targeting manufacturing business
This query surfaces top threats like Tycoon 2FA and EvilProxy plus highlights the interest of Storm-1747 APT group that operates Tycoon 2FA to the country’s production sector. This becomes an immediate priority list for detection engineering, threat hunting hypotheses, and security awareness training.</p>

<p>Analysts access sandbox sessions and real-world IOCs related to those threats. IOCs and TTPs instantly provided by TI Lookup fuel detection rules for the most relevant threats thus allowing to detect and mitigate incidents proactively, protecting businesses and their customers. View a sandbox session

Sandbox analysis: see malware in action, view kill chain, gather IOCs
Why the Threat Landscape Demands Better Visibility
Attackers’ infrastructure is changing fast and it’s no longer limited to one threat per campaign. We’re now seeing the emergence of hybrid threats, where multiple malware families are combined within a single operation.</p>

<p>These blended attacks merge logic from different infrastructures, redirection layers, and credential-theft modules, making detection, tracking, and attribution significantly harder. Hybrid attack with Salty and Tycoon detected inside ANY.RUN sandbox in just 35 seconds
Recent investigations uncovered
Tycoon 2FA and Salty
working side by side in the same chain. One kit runs the initial lure and reverse proxy, while another takes over for session hijacking or credential capture. For many SOC teams, this combination breaks the existing defense strategies and detection rules, allowing attackers to slip past the security layer.</p>

<p>Tracking these changes across the broader threat landscape has become critical. Analysts must monitor behavior patterns and attack logic in real time, not just catalog kit variants. The faster teams can see these links forming, the faster they can respond to phishing campaigns built for adaptability. Conclusion: A Clearer Horizon for Modern SOCs
Businesses can’t afford SOC blind spots anymore.</p>

<p>Attackers specialize, campaigns localize, and malware evolves faster than signatures can keep up. Proactive defense requires context, clarity, and speed. Threat Intelligence Lookup strengthened with industry and geo context and supported by fresh indicators from TI Feeds gives SOC leaders exactly that. Instead of reacting to alerts in the dark, decision makers gain a forward-looking view of the threats that really matter to their business.</p>

<h2 id="china-linked-ink-dragon-hacks-governments-using-shadowpad-and-finaldraft-malware"><a id="article-7"></a>China-Linked Ink Dragon Hacks Governments Using ShadowPad and FINALDRAFT Malware</h2>

<p>The threat actor known as
Jewelbug
has been increasingly focusing on government targets in Europe since July 2025, even as it continues to attack entities located in Southeast Asia and South America. Check Point Research is tracking the cluster under the name
Ink Dragon
. It’s also referenced by the broader cybersecurity community under the names
CL-STA-0049
,
Earth Alux
, and
REF7707
. The China-aligned hacking group is assessed to be active since at least March 2023.</p>

<p>“The actor’s campaigns combine solid software engineering, disciplined operational playbooks, and a willingness to reuse platform-native tools to blend into normal enterprise telemetry,” the cybersecurity company
said
in a technical breakdown published Tuesday. “This mix makes their intrusions both effective and stealthy.”
Eli Smadja, group manager of Products R&amp;D at Check Point Software, told The Hacker News that the activity is still ongoing, and that the campaign has “impacted several dozen victims, including government entities and telecommunications organizations, across Europe, Asia, and Africa.”
Details of the threat group first emerged in February 2025 when Elastic Security Labs and Palo Alto Networks Unit 42
detailed
its use of a backdoor called FINALDRAFT (aka Squidoor) that’s capable of infecting both Windows and Linux systems. In recent months, Ink Dragon has also been attributed a five-month-long intrusion targeting a Russian IT service provider. Attack chains mounted by the adversary have leveraged vulnerable services in internet-exposed web applications to drop web shells, which are then used to deliver additional payloads like VARGEIT and Cobalt Strike beacons to facilitate command-and-control (C2), discovery, lateral movement, defense evasion, and data exfiltration.</p>

<p>Another notable backdoor in the threat actor’s malware arsenal is
NANOREMOTE
, which uses the Google Drive API for uploading and downloading files between the C2 server and the compromised endpoint. Check Point said it did not encounter the malware in the intrusions and investigations it observed. “It is possible that the actor selectively deploys tools from a broader toolkit, depending on the victim’s environment, operational needs, and the desire to blend in with legitimate traffic,” Smadja said. Ink Dragon has also relied on predictable or mismanaged
ASP.NET machine key values
to carry out ViewState deserialization attacks against vulnerable IIS and SharePoint servers, and then install a custom ShadowPad IIS Listener module to turn these compromised servers into part of its C2 infrastructure and enable them to proxy commands and traffic, improving resilience in the process.</p>

<p>“This design allows attackers to route traffic not only deeper inside a single organization’s network, but also across different victim networks entirely,” Check Point said. “As a result, one compromise can quietly become another hop in a global, multi-layered infrastructure supporting ongoing campaigns elsewhere, blending operational control with strategic reuse of previously breached assets.”
The listener module is also equipped to run different commands on the IIS machine, providing attackers with greater control over the system to conduct reconnaissance and stage payloads. In addition to exploiting publicly disclosed machine keys to achieve ASP.NET ViewState deserialization, the threat actor has been found to weaponize
ToolShell SharePoint flaws
to drop web shells on compromised servers. Other steps carried out by Ink Dragon are listed below -
Use the IIS machine key to obtain a local administrative credential and leverage it for lateral movement over an RDP tunnel
Create scheduled tasks and install services to establish persistence
Dump LSASS dumps and extract registry hives to achieve privilege escalation
Modify host firewall rules to allow outbound traffic and transform the infected hosts into a ShadowPad relay network
“In at least one instance, the actor located an idle RDP session belonging to a Domain Administrator that had authenticated via Network Level Authentication (CredSSP) using NTLMv2 fallback.</p>

<p>Since the session remained disconnected but not logged off, it is highly likely that LSASS retained the associated logon token and NTLM verifier in memory,” Check Point said. “Ink Dragon obtained SYSTEM-level access to the host, extracted the token (and possibly the NTLM key material), and reused it to perform authenticated SMB operations. Through these actions, they were able to write to administrative shares and exfiltrate NTDS.dit and registry hives, marking the point at which they achieved domain-wide privilege escalation and control.”
The intrusions have been found to rely on a number of components rather than a single backdoor or a monolithic framework to establish long-term persistence. These include -
ShadowPad Loader, which is used to decrypt and run the
ShadowPad
core module in memory
CDBLoader, which
uses
Microsoft Console Debugger (“cdb.exe”) to run shellcode and load encrypted payloads
LalsDumper, which extracts an LSASS dump
032Loader, which is used to decrypt and execute payloads
FINALDRAFT, an updated version of the known remote administration tool that abuses Outlook and the Microsoft Graph API for C2
“The cluster has introduced a new variant of FINALDRAFT malware with enhanced stealth and higher exfiltration throughput, along with advanced evasion techniques that enable stealthy lateral movement and multi-stage malware deployment across compromised networks,” Check Point said.</p>

<p>“FINALDRAFT implements a modular command framework in which operators push encoded command documents to the victim’s mailbox, and the implant pulls, decrypts, and executes them.”
The cybersecurity company also pointed out that it detected evidence of a second threat actor known as
REF3927
(aka RudePanda) on “several” of the same victim environments breached by Ink Dragon. That said, there are no indications that the two clusters are operationally linked. It’s believed that both intrusion sets exploited the same initial access methods to obtain footholds. “Ink Dragon presents a threat model in which the boundary between ‘compromised host’ and ‘command infrastructure’ no longer exists,” Check Point concluded.</p>

<p>“Each foothold becomes a node in a larger, operator-controlled network – a living mesh that grows stronger with every additional victim.”
“Defenders must therefore view intrusions not only as local breaches but as potential links in an external, attacker-managed ecosystem, where shutting down a single node is insufficient unless the entire relay chain is identified and dismantled. Ink Dragon’s relay-centric architecture is among the more mature uses of ShadowPad observed to date. A blueprint for long-term, multi-organizational access built on the victims themselves.”

<h2 id="ghostposter-malware-found-in-17-firefox-add-ons-with-50000-downloads"><a id="article-8"></a>GhostPoster Malware Found in 17 Firefox Add-ons with 50,000+ Downloads</h2>

<p>A new campaign named
GhostPoster
has
leveraged
logo files associated with 17 Mozilla Firefox browser add-ons to embed malicious JavaScript code designed to hijack affiliate links, inject tracking code, and commit click and ad fraud. The extensions have been collectively downloaded over 50,000 times, according to Koi Security, which discovered the campaign. The add-ons are no longer available. These browser programs were advertised as VPNs, screenshot utilities, ad blockers, and unofficial versions of Google Translate.</p>

<p>The oldest add-on, Dark Mode, was published on October 25, 2024, offering the ability to enable a dark theme for all websites. The full list of the browser add-ons is below -
Free VPN
Screenshot
Weather (weather-best-forecast)
Mouse Gesture (crxMouse)
Cache - Fast site loader
Free MP3 Downloader
Google Translate (google-translate-right-clicks)

Google Translate (right-click-google-translate)
“What they actually deliver is a multi-stage malware payload that monitors everything you browse, strips away your browser’s security protections, and opens a backdoor for remote code execution,” security researchers Lotan Sery and Noga Gouldman said. The attack chain begins when the logo file is fetched when one of the above-mentioned extensions is loaded. The malicious code parses the file to look for a marker containing the “===” sign in order to extract JavaScript code, a loader that reaches out to an external server (“www.liveupdt[.]com” or “www.dealctr[.]com”) to retrieve the main payload, waiting 48 hours in between every attempt.</p>

<p>To further evade detection, the loader is configured to fetch the payload only 10% of the time. This randomness is a deliberate choice that’s introduced to sidestep efforts to monitor network traffic. The retrieved payload is a custom-encoded comprehensive toolkit capable of monetizing browser activities without the victims’ knowledge through four different ways -
Affiliate link hijacking, which intercepts affiliate links to e-commerce sites like Taobao or JD.com, depriving legitimate affiliates of their commission
Tracking injection, which inserts the Google Analytics tracking code into every web page visited by the victim, to silently profile them
Security header stripping, which removes security headers like Content-Security-Policy and X-Frame-Options from HTTP responses, exposing users to clickjacking and cross-site scripting attacks
Hidden iframe injection, which injects invisible iframes into pages to load URLs from attacker-controlled servers and enable ad and click fraud
CAPTCHA bypass, which employs various methods to bypass CAPTCHA challenges and evade bot detection safeguards
“Why would malware need to bypass CAPTCHAs? Because some of its operations, like the hidden iframe injections, trigger bot detection,” the researchers explained.</p>

<p>“The malware needs to prove it’s ‘human’ to keep operating.”
Besides probability checks, the add-ons also incorporate time-based delays that prevent the malware from activating until more than six days after installation. These layered evasion techniques make it harder to detect what’s going on behind the scenes. It’s worth emphasizing here that not all the extensions above use the same steganographic attack chain, but all of them exhibit the same behavior and communicate with the same command-and-control (C2) infrastructure, indicating it’s the work of a single threat actor or group that has experimented with different lures and methods. The development comes merely days after a popular VPN extension for Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge was
caught
secretly harvesting AI conversations from ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini and exfiltrating them to data brokers.</p>

<p>In August 2025, another Chrome extension named FreeVPN.One was
observed
collecting screenshots, system information, and users’ locations. “Free VPNs promise privacy, but nothing in life comes free,” Koi Security said. “Again and again, they deliver surveillance instead.”

<h2 id="compromised-iam-credentials-power-a-large-aws-crypto-mining-campaign"><a id="article-9"></a>Compromised IAM Credentials Power a Large AWS Crypto Mining Campaign</h2>

<p>An ongoing campaign has been observed targeting Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers using compromised Identity and Access Management (
IAM
) credentials to enable cryptocurrency mining. The activity, first detected by Amazon’s GuardDuty managed threat detection service and its automated security monitoring systems on November 2, 2025, employs never-before-seen persistence techniques to hamper incident response and continue unimpeded, according to a new report shared by the tech giant ahead of publication. “Operating from an external hosting provider, the threat actor quickly enumerated resources and permissions before deploying crypto mining resources across ECS and EC2,” Amazon
said
. “Within 10 minutes of the threat actor gaining initial access, crypto miners were operational.”
The multi-stage attack chain essentially begins with the unknown adversary leveraging compromised IAM user credentials with admin-like privileges to initiate a discovery phase designed to probe the environment for EC2 service quotas and test their permissions by invoking the
RunInstances API
with the “DryRun” flag set.</p>

<p>This enabling of the “DryRun” flag is crucial and intentional as it enables the attackers to validate their IAM permissions without actually launching instances, thereby avoiding racking up costs and minimizing their forensic trail. The end goal of the step is to determine if the target infrastructure is suitable for deploying the miner program. The infection proceeds to the next stage when the threat actor calls
CreateServiceLinkedRole
and
CreateRole
to create IAM roles for autoscaling groups and AWS Lambda, respectively. Once the roles are created, the “
AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole
“ policy is attached to the Lambda role.</p>

<p>In the activity observed to date, the threat actor is said to have created dozens of ECS clusters across the environment, in some cases exceeding 50 ECS clusters in a single attack. “They then called RegisterTaskDefinition with a malicious DockerHub image yenik65958/secret:user,” Amazon said. “With the same string used for the cluster creation, the actor then created a service, using the task definition to initiate crypto mining on ECS Fargate nodes.”
The DockerHub image, which has since been taken down, is configured to run a shell script as soon as it’s deployed to launch cryptocurrency mining using the
RandomVIREL
mining algorithm. Additionally, the threat actor has been observed creating autoscaling groups that are set to scale from 20 to 999 instances in an effort to exploit EC2 service quotas and maximize resource consumption.</p>

<p>The EC2 activity has targeted both high-performance GPU and machine learning instances and compute, memory, and general-purpose instances. What makes this campaign stand apart is its use of the
ModifyInstanceAttribute
action with the “disableApiTermination” parameter set to “True,” which prevents an instance from being terminated using the Amazon EC2 console, command line interface, or API. This, in turn, has the effect of requiring victims to re-enable API termination before deleting the impacted resources. “Instance termination protection can impair incident response capabilities and disrupt automated remediation controls,” Amazon said.</p>

<p>“This technique demonstrates an understanding of common security response procedures and intent to maximize the duration of mining operations.”
This is not the first time the security risk associated with ModifyInstanceAttribute has come to light. In April 2024, security researcher Harsha Koushik
demonstrated
a proof-of-concept (PoC) that detailed how the action can be abused to take over instances, exfiltrate instance role credentials, and even seize control of the entire AWS account. Furthermore, the attacks entail the creation of a
Lambda function
that can be invoked by any principal and an IAM user “user-x1x2x3x4” to which the AWS managed policy “
AmazonSESFullAccess
“ is attached, granting the adversary complete access over the Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) to likely carry out phishing attacks. To secure against the threat, Amazon is urging AWS customers to follow the steps below -
Enforce strong identity and access management controls
Implement temporary credentials instead of long-term access keys
Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users
Apply the principle of least privilege (PoLP) to IAM principals to restrict access
Add container security controls to scan for suspicious images
Monitor unusual CPU allocation requests in ECS task definitions
Use AWS CloudTrail to log events across AWS services
Ensure AWS GuardDuty is enabled to facilitate automated response workflows
“The threat actor’s scripted use of multiple compute services, in combination with emerging persistence techniques, represents a significant advancement in crypto mining attack methodologies,” Amazon concluded.</p>

<h2 id="rogue-nuget-package-poses-as-tracerfody-steals-cryptocurrency-wallet-data"><a id="article-10"></a>Rogue NuGet Package Poses as Tracer.Fody, Steals Cryptocurrency Wallet Data</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new malicious NuGet package that typosquats and impersonates the popular .NET tracing library and its author to sneak in a cryptocurrency wallet stealer. The malicious package, named “
Tracer.Fody.NLog
,” remained on the repository for nearly six years. It was published by a user named “csnemess” on February 26, 2020. It masquerades as “
Tracer.Fody
,” which is maintained by “
csnemes
.” The package continues to remain available as of writing, and has been downloaded at least 2,000 times, out of which 19 took place over the last six weeks for version 3.2.4.</p>

<p>“It presents itself as a standard .NET tracing integration but in reality functions as a cryptocurrency wallet stealer,” Socket security researcher Kirill Boychenko
said
. “Inside the malicious package, the embedded Tracer.Fody.dll scans the default Stratis wallet directory, reads *.wallet.json files, extracts wallet data, and exfiltrates it together with the wallet password to threat actor-controlled infrastructure in Russia at
176.113.82[.]163
.”
The software supply chain security company said the threat leveraged a number of tactics that allowed it to elude casual review, including mimicking the legitimate maintainer by using a name that differs by a single letter (“csnemes” vs. “csnemess”), using Cyrillic lookalike characters in the source code, and hiding the malicious routine within a generic helper function (“Guard.NotNull”) that’s used during regular program execution. Once a project references the malicious package, it activates its behavior by scanning the default Stratis wallet directory on Windows (“%APPDATA%\StratisNode\stratis\StratisMain”), reads *.wallet.json files and in-memory passwords, and exfiltrates them to the Russian-hosted IP address.</p>

<p>“All exceptions are silently caught, so even if the exfiltration fails, the host application continues to run without any visible error while successful calls quietly leak wallet data to the threat actor’s infrastructure,” Boychenko said. Socket said the same IP address was previously put to use in December 2023 in
connection
with another NuGet impersonation attack in which the threat actor published a package named “Cleary.AsyncExtensions” under the alias “stevencleary” and incorporated functionality to siphon wallet seed phrases. The package was so-called to disguise itself as the
AsyncEx NuGet library
. The findings once illustrate how malicious typosquats mirroring legitimate tools can stealthily operate without attracting any attention across the open-source repository ecosystems.</p>

<p>“Defenders should expect to see similar activity and follow-on implants that extend this pattern,” Socket said. “Likely targets include other logging and tracing integrations, argument validation libraries, and utility packages that are common in .NET projects.”

<h2 id="amazon-exposes-years-long-gru-cyber-campaign-targeting-energy-and-cloud-infrastructure"><a id="article-11"></a>Amazon Exposes Years-Long GRU Cyber Campaign Targeting Energy and Cloud Infrastructure</h2>

<p>Amazon’s threat intelligence team has
disclosed
details of a “years-long” Russian state-sponsored campaign that targeted Western critical infrastructure between 2021 and 2025. Targets of the campaign included energy sector organizations across Western nations, critical infrastructure providers in North America and Europe, and entities with cloud-hosted network infrastructure. The activity has been attributed with high confidence to Russia’s Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), citing infrastructure overlaps with
APT44
, which is also known as FROZENBARENTS, Sandworm, Seashell Blizzard, and Voodoo Bear. The activity is notable for using as initial access vectors misconfigured customer network edge devices with exposed management interfaces, as N-day and zero-day vulnerability exploitation activity declined over the time period – indicative of a shift in attacks aimed at critical infrastructure, the tech giant said.</p>

<p>“This tactical adaptation enables the same operational outcomes, credential harvesting, and lateral movement into victim organizations’ online services and infrastructure, while reducing the actor’s exposure and resource expenditure,” CJ Moses, Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) of Amazon Integrated Security, said. The attacks have been found to leverage the following vulnerabilities and tactics over the course of five years -
2021-2022 - Exploitation of WatchGuard Firebox and XTM flaw (
CVE-2022-26318
) and targeting of misconfigured edge network devices
2022-2023 - Exploitation of Atlassian Confluence flaws (
CVE-2021-26084
and
CVE-2023-22518
) and continued targeting of misconfigured edge network devices
2024 - Exploitation of Veeam flaw (
CVE-2023-27532
) and continued targeting of misconfigured edge network devices
2025 - Sustained targeting of misconfigured edge network devices
The intrusion activity, per Amazon, singled out enterprise routers and routing infrastructure, VPN concentrators and remote access gateways, network management appliances, collaboration and wiki platforms, and cloud-based project management systems. These efforts are likely designed to facilitate credential harvesting at scale, given the threat actor’s ability to position themselves strategically on the network edge to intercept sensitive information in transit. Telemetry data has also uncovered what has been described as coordinated attempts aimed at misconfigured customer network edge devices hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure.</p>

<p>“Network connection analysis shows actor-controlled IP addresses establishing persistent connections to compromised EC2 instances operating customers’ network appliance software,” Moses said. “Analysis revealed persistent connections consistent with interactive access and data retrieval across multiple affected instances.”
In addition, Amazon said it observed credential replay attacks against victim organizations’ online services as part of attempts to obtain a deeper foothold into targeted networks. Although these attempts are assessed to be unsuccessful, they lend weight to the aforementioned hypothesis that the adversary is grabbing credentials from compromised customer network infrastructure for follow-on attacks. The entire attack plays out as follows -
Compromise the customer network edge device hosted on AWS
Leverage native packet capture capability
Gather credentials from intercepted traffic
Replay credentials against the victim organizations’ online services and infrastructure
Establish persistent access for lateral movement
The credential replay operations have targeted energy, technology/cloud services, and telecom service providers across North America, Western and Eastern Europe, and the Middle East.</p>

<p>“The targeting demonstrates sustained focus on the energy sector supply chain, including both direct operators and third-party service providers with access to critical infrastructure networks,” Moses noted. Interestingly, the intrusion set also shares
infrastructure overlaps
(91.99.25[.]54) with another cluster tracked by Bitdefender under the name
Curly COMrades
, which is believed to be operating with interests that are aligned with Russia since late 2023. This has raised the possibility that the two clusters may represent complementary operations within a broader campaign undertaken by GRU. “This potential operational division, where one cluster focuses on network access and initial compromise while another handles host-based persistence and evasion, aligns with GRU operational patterns of specialized subclusters supporting broader campaign objectives,” Moses said.</p>

<p>Amazon said it identified and notified affected customers, as well as disrupted active threat actor operations targeting its cloud services. However, the company did not disclose how many attacks it has recorded as part of the campaign, nor share if there has been a change in operational tempo since the first wave of attacks occurred in 2021. Organizations are recommended to audit all network edge devices for unexpected packet capture utilities, implement strong authentication, monitor for authentication attempts from unexpected geographic locations, and keep tabs on credential replay attacks.

<h2 id="why-data-security-and-privacy-need-to-start-in-code"><a id="article-12"></a>Why Data Security and Privacy Need to Start in Code</h2>

<p>AI-assisted coding and AI app generation platforms have created an unprecedented surge in software development. Companies are now facing rapid growth in both the number of applications and the pace of change within those applications. Security and privacy teams are under significant pressure as the surface area they must cover is expanding quickly while their staffing levels remain largely unchanged. Existing data security and privacy solutions are too
reactive
for this new era.</p>

<p>Many begin with data already collected in production, which is often too late. These solutions frequently miss hidden data flows to third party and AI integrations, and for the data sinks they do cover, they help detect risks but do not prevent them. The question is whether many of these issues can instead be prevented early. The answer is yes.</p>

<p>Prevention is possible by embedding detection and governance controls directly into development. HoundDog.ai
provides a privacy code scanner built for exactly this purpose. Data security and privacy issues that can be proactively addressed
Sensitive data exposure in logs remains one of the most common and costly problems
When sensitive data appears in logs, relying on DLP solutions is reactive, unreliable, and slow. Teams may spend weeks cleaning logs, identifying exposure across the systems that ingested them, and revising the code after the fact.</p>

<p>These incidents often begin with simple developer oversights, such as using a tainted variable or printing an entire user object in a debug function. As engineering teams grow past 20 developers, keeping track of all code paths becomes difficult and these oversights become more frequent. Inaccurate or outdated data maps also drive considerable privacy risk
A core requirement in GDPR and US Privacy Frameworks is the need to document processing activities with details about the types of personal data collected, processed, stored, and shared. Data maps then feed into mandatory privacy reports such as Records of Processing Activities (RoPA), Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA), and Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA).</p>

<p>These reports must document the legal bases for processing, demonstrate compliance with data minimization and retention principles, and ensure that data subjects have transparency and can exercise their rights. In fast-moving environments, though, data maps quickly drift out of date. Traditional workflows in GRC tools require privacy teams to interview application owners repeatedly, a process that is both slow and error-prone. Important details are often missed, especially in companies with hundreds or thousands of code repositories.</p>

<p>Production-focused privacy platforms provide only partial automation because they attempt to infer data flows based on data already stored in production systems. They often cannot see SDKs, abstractions, and integrations embedded in the code. These blind spots can lead to violations of data processing agreements or inaccurate disclosures in privacy notices. Since these platforms detect issues only after data is already flowing, they offer no proactive controls that prevent risky behavior in the first place.</p>

<p>Another major challenge is the widespread experimentation with AI inside codebases
Many companies have policies restricting AI services in their products. Yet when scanning their repositories, it is common to find AI-related SDKs such as LangChain or LlamaIndex in 5% to 10% of repositories. Privacy and security teams must then understand which data types are being sent to these AI systems and whether user notices and legal bases cover these flows. AI usage itself is not the problem.</p>

<p>The issue arises when developers introduce AI without oversight. Without proactive technical enforcement, teams must retroactively investigate and document these flows, which is time-consuming and often incomplete. As AI integrations grow in number, the risk of noncompliance grows too. What is
HoundDog.ai
HoundDog.ai provides a
privacy-focused static code scanner
that continuously analyzes source code to document sensitive data flows across storage systems, AI integrations, and third-party services.</p>

<p>The scanner identifies privacy risks and sensitive data leaks early in development, before code is merged and before data is ever processed. The engine is built in Rust, which is memory safe, and it is lightweight and fast. It scans millions of lines of code in under a minute. The scanner was recently integrated with Replit, the AI app generation platform used by 45M creators, providing visibility into privacy risks across the millions of applications generated by the platform.</p>

<p>Key capabilities
AI Governance and Third-Party Risk Management
Identify AI and third-party integrations embedded in code with high confidence, including hidden libraries and abstractions often associated with shadow AI. Proactive Sensitive Data Leak Detection
Embed privacy across all stages in development, from IDE environments, with extensions available for VS Code, IntelliJ, Cursor, and Eclipse, to CI pipelines that use direct source code integrations and automatically push CI configurations as direct commits or pull requests requiring approval. Track more than 100 types of sensitive data, including Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Protected Health Information (PHI), Cardholder Data (CHD), and authentication tokens, and follow them across transformations into risky sinks such as LLM prompts, logs, files, local storage, and third-party SDKs. Evidence Generation for Privacy Compliance
Automatically generate evidence-based data maps that show how sensitive data is collected, processed, and shared.</p>

<p>Produce audit-ready Records of Processing Activities (RoPA), Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA), and Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA), prefilled with detected data flows and privacy risks identified by the scanner. Why this matters
Companies need to eliminate blind spots
A privacy scanner that works at the code level provides visibility into integrations and abstractions that production tools miss. This includes hidden SDKs, third-party libraries, and AI frameworks that never show up through production scans until it is too late. Teams also need to catch privacy risks before they occur
Plaintext authentication tokens or sensitive data in logs, or unapproved data sent to third-party integrations, must be stopped at the source.</p>

<p>Prevention is the only reliable way to avoid incidents and compliance gaps. Privacy teams require accurate and continuously updated data maps
Automated generation of RoPAs, PIAs, and DPIAs based on code evidence ensures that documentation keeps pace with development, without repeated manual interviews or spreadsheet updates. Comparison with other tools
Privacy and security engineering teams use a mix of tools, but each category has fundamental limitations. General-purpose static analysis tools provide custom rules but lack privacy awareness.</p>

<p>They treat different sensitive data types as equivalent and cannot understand modern AI-driven data flows. They rely on simple pattern matching, which produces noisy alerts and requires constant maintenance. They also lack any built-in compliance reporting. Post-deployment privacy platforms map data flows based on information stored in production systems.</p>

<p>They cannot detect integrations or flows that have not yet produced data in those systems and cannot see abstractions hidden in code. Because they operate after deployment, they cannot prevent risks and introduce a significant delay between issue introduction and detection. Reactive Data Loss Prevention tools intervene only after data has leaked. They lack visibility into source code and cannot identify root causes.</p>

<p>When sensitive data reaches logs or transmissions, the cleanup is slow. Teams often spend weeks remediating and reviewing exposure across many systems. HoundDog.ai improves on these approaches by introducing a static analysis engine purpose-built for privacy. It performs deep interprocedural analysis across files and functions to trace sensitive data such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Protected Health Information (PHI), Cardholder Data (CHD), and authentication tokens.</p>

<p>It understands transformations, sanitization logic, and control flow. It identifies when data reaches risky sinks such as logs, files, local storage, third-party SDKs, and LLM prompts. It prioritizes issues based on sensitivity and actual risk rather than simple patterns. It includes native support for more than 100 sensitive data types and allows customization.</p>

<p>HoundDog.ai also detects both direct and indirect AI integrations from source code. It identifies unsafe or unsanitized data flows into prompts and allows teams to enforce allowlists that define which data types may be used with AI services. This proactive model blocks unsafe prompt construction before code is merged, providing enforcement that runtime filters cannot match. Beyond detection, HoundDog.ai automates the creation of privacy documentation.</p>

<p>It produces an always fresh inventory of internal and external data flows, storage locations, and third-party dependencies. It generates audit-ready Records of Processing Activities and Privacy Impact Assessments populated with real evidence and aligned to frameworks such as FedRAMP, DoD RMF, HIPAA, and NIST 800-53. Customer success
HoundDog.ai
is already used by Fortune 1000 companies across healthcare and financial services, scanning thousands of repositories. These organizations are reducing data mapping overhead, catching privacy issues early in development, and maintaining compliance without slowing engineering.</p>

<h2 id="fortinet-fortigate-under-active-attack-through-saml-sso-authentication-bypass"><a id="article-13"></a>Fortinet FortiGate Under Active Attack Through SAML SSO Authentication Bypass</h2>

<p>Threat actors have begun to exploit two newly disclosed security flaws in Fortinet FortiGate devices, less than a week after public disclosure. Cybersecurity company Arctic Wolf said it observed active intrusions involving malicious single sign-on (SSO) logins on FortiGate appliances on December 12, 2025. The attacks exploit
two critical authentication bypasses
(CVE-2025-59718 and CVE-2025-59719, CVSS scores: 9.8). Patches for the flaws were released by Fortinet last week for FortiOS, FortiWeb, FortiProxy, and FortiSwitchManager.</p>

<p>“These vulnerabilities allow unauthenticated bypass of SSO login authentication via crafted SAML messages, if the FortiCloud SSO feature is enabled on affected devices,” Arctic Wolf Labs
said
in a new bulletin. It’s worth noting that while FortiCloud SSO is disabled by default, it is automatically enabled during FortiCare registration unless administrators explicitly turn it off using the “Allow administrative login using FortiCloud SSO” setting in the registration page. In the malicious activity observed by Arctic Wolf, IP addresses associated with a limited set of hosting providers, such as The Constant Company llc, Bl Networks, and Kaopu Cloud Hk Limited, were used to carry out malicious SSO logins against the “admin” account. Following the logins, the attackers have been found to export device configurations via the GUI to the same IP addresses.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Arctic Wolf Labs told The Hacker News that the campaign is still in its early stages, adding that only a relatively small proportion of monitored networks have been affected. “Our investigation is ongoing into the origin and nature of this threat activity, and we are not able to attribute the attacks to any specific threat actor group at this time,” it added. “So far, the pattern of activity has appeared to be opportunistic in nature.”
In light of ongoing exploitation activity, organizations are advised to apply the patches as soon as possible. As mitigations, it’s essential to disable FortiCloud SSO until the instances are updated to the latest version and limit access to management interfaces of firewalls and VPNs to trusted internal users.</p>

<p>“Although credentials are typically hashed in network appliance configurations, threat actors are known to crack hashes offline, especially if credentials are weak and susceptible to dictionary attacks,” Arctic Wolf said. Fortinet customers who find indicators of compromise (IoCs) consistent with the campaign are recommended to assume compromise and reset hashed firewall credentials stored in the exfiltrated configurations. Update
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), on December 16, 2025,
added
CVE-2025-59718 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (
KEV
) catalog, requiring Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to apply the fixes by December 23, 2025.</p>

<h2 id="react2shell-vulnerability-actively-exploited-to-deploy-linux-backdoors"><a id="article-14"></a>React2Shell Vulnerability Actively Exploited to Deploy Linux Backdoors</h2>

<p>The security vulnerability known as
React2Shell
is being exploited by threat actors to deliver malware families like KSwapDoor and ZnDoor, according to findings from Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 and NTT Security. “KSwapDoor is a professionally engineered remote access tool designed with stealth in mind,” Justin Moore, senior manager of threat intel research at Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, said in a statement. “It builds an internal mesh network, allowing compromised servers to talk to each other and evade security blocks. It uses military-grade encryption to hide its communications and, most alarmingly, features a ‘sleeper’ mode that lets attackers bypass firewalls by waking the malware up with a secret, invisible signal.”
Moore told The Hacker News that the backdoor has been identified in two distinct regions and industries, and that it’s likely the work of Chinese nation-state actors, based on the malware’s code structure and functional overlap with previous Linux backdoors, along with other tools used by adversaries from the region.</p>

<p>“This limited footprint is consistent with the behavior of a sophisticated, custom-engineered backdoor,” Moore added. “Threat actors rarely risk exposing such thoughtfully written and engineered tools in widespread campaigns but instead, they reserve them for precise, high-value targeting.”
The cybersecurity company
noted
that it was previously mistakenly classified as
BPFDoor
, adding that the Linux backdoor offers interactive shell, command execution, file operations and lateral movement scanning capabilities. It also impersonates a legitimate Linux kernel swap daemon to evade detection. The initial misclassification of KSwapDoor as BPFDoor, according to Moore, stemmed from the use of a technique called Raw Socket Sniffing, which enables the malware strains to read network traffic directly from the wire without opening a visible port.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that BPFDoor is
designed
to create a special packet sniffing socket that monitors for incoming traffic with a specific Magic Byte sequence to trigger its malicious behavior. “Because we discovered this specific ‘listening’ code inside KSwapDoor, we initially flagged it as BPFDoor based on that shared signature,” Moore explained. “However, the reality is that KSwapDoor includes this sniffing capability merely as a dormant backup entry method; its main engine is actually a sophisticated peer-to-peer router that allows for complex lateral movement, a capability that BPFDoor completely lacks.”
In a related development, NTT Security
said
organizations in Japan are being targeted by cyber attacks exploiting React2Shell to deploy ZnDoor, a malware that’s been assessed to be detected in the wild since December 2023. The attack chains involve running a bash command to fetch the payload from a remote server (45.76.155[.]14) using wget and executing it.</p>

<p>A remote access trojan, it contacts the same threat actor-controlled infrastructure to receive commands and execute them on the host. Some of the supported commands are listed below -
shell, to execute a command
interactive_shell, to launch an interactive shell
explorer, to get a list of directories
explorer_cat, to read and display a file

The disclosure comes as the vulnerability, tracked as
CVE-2025-55182
(CVSS score: 10.0), has been
exploited
by multiple threat actors, Google
identifying
at least five China-nexus groups that have weaponized it to distribute an array of payloads -
UNC6600, to deliver a tunneling utility named MINOCAT
UNC6586, to deliver a downloader named
SNOWLIGHT
UNC6588, to deliver a backdoor named COMPOOD
UNC6603, to deliver an updated version of a Go backdoor named HISONIC that uses Cloudflare Pages and GitLab to retrieve encrypted configuration and blend in with legitimate network activity
UNC6595, to deliver a Linux version of ANGRYREBEL (aka Noodle RAT)
Microsoft, in its own advisory for CVE-2025-55182, said threat actors have taken advantage of the flaw to run arbitrary commands for post-exploitation, including setting up reverse shells to known Cobalt Strike servers, and then dropping remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools such as MeshAgent, modifying the authorized_keys file, and enabling root login. Some of the payloads delivered in these attacks include VShell, EtherRAT, SNOWLIGHT, ShadowPad, and XMRig. The attacks are also characterized by the use of Cloudflare Tunnel endpoints (“*.trycloudflare.com”) to evade security defenses, as well as conducting reconnaissance of the compromised environments to facilitate lateral movement and credential theft.</p>

<p>The credential harvesting activity, the Windows maker said, targeted Azure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) endpoints for Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Tencent Cloud with the end goal of acquiring identity tokens to burrow deeper into cloud infrastructures. “Attackers also deployed secret discovery tools such as TruffleHog and Gitleaks, along with custom scripts to extract several different secrets,” the Microsoft Defender Security Research Team
said
. “Attempts to harvest AI and cloud-native credentials, such as OpenAI API keys, Databricks tokens, and Kubernetes service‑account credentials, were also observed. Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) (az) and Azure Developer CLI (azd) were also used to obtain tokens.”
In another campaign
detailed
by Beelzebub, threat actors have been observed exploiting flaws in Next.js, including
CVE-2025-29927
and
CVE-2025-66478
(the same React2Shell bug before it was rejected as a duplicate), to enable systematic extraction of credentials and sensitive data -
.env, .env.local, .env.production, .env.development
System environment variables (printenv, env)
SSH keys (~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_ed25519, /root/.ssh/*)
Cloud credentials (~/.aws/credentials, ~/.docker/config.json)
Git credentials (~/.git-credentials, ~/.gitconfig)
Command history (last 100 commands from ~/.bash_history)
System files (/etc/shadow, /etc/passwd)
The malware also proceeds to create persistence on the host to survive system reboots, install a SOCKS5 proxy, establish a reverse shell to “67.217.57[.]240:888,” and install a React scanner to probe the internet for further propagation.</p>

<p>The activity, codenamed Operation PCPcat, is estimated to have already breached 59,128 servers. “The campaign shows characteristics of large-scale intelligence operations and data exfiltration on an industrial scale,” the Italian company said. The Shadowserver Foundation is
currently tracking
over 111,000 IP addresses vulnerable to React2Shell attacks, with over
77,800 instances
in the U.S., followed by Germany (7,500), France (4,000), and India (2,300). Data from GreyNoise
shows
that there are 547 malicious IP addresses from the U.S., India, the U.K., Singapore, and the Netherlands partaking in the exploitation efforts over the past 24 hours.</p>
