<h2 id="microsoft-links-ongoing-sharepoint-exploits-to-three-chinese-hacker-groups"><a id="article-1"></a>Microsoft Links Ongoing SharePoint Exploits to Three Chinese Hacker Groups</h2>

<p>Microsoft has formally tied the exploitation of security flaws in internet-facing SharePoint Server instances to two Chinese hacking groups called Linen Typhoon and Violet Typhoon
as early as July 7, 2025
, corroborating earlier reports. The tech giant said it also observed a third China-based threat actor, which it tracks as Storm-2603, weaponizing the flaws as well to obtain initial access to target organizations. ‚ÄúWith the rapid adoption of these exploits, Microsoft assesses with high confidence that threat actors will continue to integrate them into their attacks against unpatched on-premises SharePoint systems,‚Äù the tech giant
said
in a report published today. A brief description of the threat activity clusters is below -
Linen Typhoon
(aka
APT27
, Bronze Union, Emissary Panda, Iodine, Lucky Mouse, Red Phoenix, and UNC215), which is active since 2012 and has been previously attributed to malware families like SysUpdate, HyperBro, and PlugX
Violet Typhoon
(aka APT31, Bronze Vinewood, Judgement Panda, Red Keres, and Zirconium), which is active since 2015 and has been previously attributed attacks targeting the United States, Finland, and Czechia
Storm-2603
, a suspected China-based threat actor that has deployed Warlock and LockBit ransomware in the past
The vulnerabilities, which affect on-premises SharePoint servers, have been found to leverage incomplete fixes for CVE-2025-49706, a spoofing flaw, and CVE-2025-49704, a remote code execution bug.</p>

<p>The bypasses have been assigned the CVE identifiers CVE-2025-53771 and CVE-2025-53770, respectively. In the attacks observed by Microsoft, the threat actors have been found exploiting on-premises SharePoint servers through a POST request to the ToolPane endpoint, resulting in an authentication bypass and remote code execution. As disclosed by other cybersecurity vendors, the infection chains pave the way for the deployment of a web shell named ‚Äúspinstall0.aspx‚Äù (aka spinstall.aspx, spinstall1.aspx, or spinstall2.aspx) that allows the adversaries to retrieve and steal MachineKey data. Cybersecurity researcher Rakesh Krishnan said ‚Äúthree distinct Microsoft Edge invocations were identified‚Äù during forensic analysis of a SharePoint exploit.</p>

<p>This includes Network Utility Process, Crashpad Handler, and GPU Process. ‚ÄúEach serves a unique function within Chromium‚Äôs architecture, yet collectively reveals a strategy of behavioral mimicry and sandbox evasion,‚Äù Krishnan
noted
, while also calling attention to the web shell‚Äôs use of Google‚Äôs Client Update Protocol (
CUP
) to ‚Äúblend malicious traffic with benign update checks.‚Äù
To mitigate the risk posed by the threat, it‚Äôs essential that users apply the latest update for SharePoint Server Subscription Edition, SharePoint Server 2019, and SharePoint Server 2016, rotate SharePoint server ASP.NET machine keys, restart Internet Information Services (IIS), and deploy Microsoft Defender for Endpoint or equivalent solutions. It‚Äôs also recommended to integrate and enable Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) and Microsoft Defender Antivirus (or similar solutions) for all on-premises SharePoint deployments and configure AMSI to enable Full Mode. ‚ÄúAdditional actors may use these exploits to target unpatched on-premises SharePoint systems, further emphasizing the need for organizations to implement mitigations and security updates immediately,‚Äù Microsoft said.</p>

<p>While the confirmation from Microsoft is the latest hacking campaign linked to China, it is also the second time Beijing-aligned threat actors have targeted the Windows maker. In March 2021, the adversarial collective tracked as Silk Typhoon (aka Hafnium) was tied to a
mass-exploitation activity
that leveraged multiple then-zero-days in Exchange Server. Earlier this month, a 33-year-old Chinese national, Xu Zewei, was
arrested
in Italy and charged with carrying out cyber attacks against American organizations and government agencies by weaponizing the Microsoft Exchange Server flaws, which came to be known as ProxyLogon. Found this article interesting?</p>

<h2 id="cisco-confirms-active-exploits-targeting-ise-flaws-enabling-unauthenticated-root-access"><a id="article-2"></a>Cisco Confirms Active Exploits Targeting ISE Flaws Enabling Unauthenticated Root Access</h2>

<p>Cisco on Monday updated its advisory of a set of recently disclosed security flaws in Identity Services Engine (ISE) and ISE Passive Identity Connector (ISE-PIC) to acknowledge active exploitation. ‚ÄúIn July 2025, the Cisco PSIRT [Product Security Incident Response Team], became aware of attempted exploitation of some of these vulnerabilities in the wild,‚Äù the company
said
in an alert. The network equipment vendor did not disclose which vulnerabilities have been weaponized in real-world attacks, the identity of the threat actors exploiting them, or the scale of the activity. Cisco ISE plays a central role in network access control, managing which users and devices are allowed onto corporate networks and under what conditions.</p>

<p>A compromise at this layer could give attackers unrestricted access to internal systems, bypassing authentication controls and logging mechanisms‚Äîturning a policy engine into an open door. The vulnerabilities outlined in the alert are all critical-rated bugs (CVSS scores: 10.0) that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to issue commands on the underlying operating system as the root user -
CVE-2025-20281
and
CVE-2025-20337</p>
<ul>
  <li>Multiple vulnerabilities in a specific API that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system as root
CVE-2025-20282</li>
  <li>A vulnerability in an internal API that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to upload arbitrary files to an affected device and then execute those files on the underlying operating system as root
While the first two flaws are the result of insufficient validation of user-supplied input, the latter stems from a lack of file validation checks that would prevent uploaded files from being placed in privileged directories on an affected system. As a result, an attacker could leverage these shortcomings by submitting a crafted API request (for CVE-2025-20281 and CVE-2025-20337) or uploading a crafted file to the affected device (for CVE-2025-20282). In light of active exploitation, it‚Äôs essential that customers upgrade to a fixed software release as soon as possible to remediate these vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>These flaws are exploitable remotely without authentication, placing unpatched systems at high risk of pre-auth remote code execution‚Äîa top-tier concern for defenders managing critical infrastructure or compliance-driven environments. Security teams should also review system logs for suspicious API activity or unauthorized file uploads, especially in externally exposed deployments. Found this article interesting? Follow us on

<h2 id="credential-theft-and-remote-access-surge-as-allakore-purerat-and-hijack-loader-proliferate"><a id="article-3"></a>Credential Theft and Remote Access Surge as AllaKore, PureRAT, and Hijack Loader Proliferate</h2>

<p>Mexican organizations are still being targeted by threat actors to deliver a modified version of AllaKore RAT and SystemBC as part of a long-running campaign. The activity has been attributed by Arctic Wolf Labs to a financially motivated hacking group called
Greedy Sponge
. It‚Äôs believed to be active since early 2021, indiscriminately targeting a wide range of sectors, such as retail, agriculture, public sector, entertainment, manufacturing, transportation, commercial services, capital goods, and banking. ‚ÄúThe AllaKore RAT payload has been heavily modified to enable the threat actors to send select banking credentials and unique authentication information back to their command-and-control (C2) server, for the purpose of conducting financial fraud,‚Äù the cybersecurity company
said
in an analysis published last week.</p>

<p>Details of the campaign were
first documented
by the BlackBerry Research and Intelligence Team (which is now part of Arctic Wolf) in January 2024, with the attacks employing phishing or drive-by compromises to distribute booby-trapped ZIP archives that ultimately facilitate the deployment of AllaKore RAT. Attack chains analyzed by Arctic Wolf show that the remote access trojan is designed to optionally deliver secondary payloads like
SystemBC
, a
C-based malware
that turns compromised Windows hosts into
SOCKS5 proxies
to allow attackers to communicate with their C2 servers. Besides dropping potent proxy tools, Greedy Sponge has also refined and updated its tradecraft to incorporate improved geofencing measures as of mid-2024 in an attempt to thwart analysis. ‚ÄúHistorically, geofencing to the Mexican region took place in the first stage, via a .NET downloader included in the trojanized Microsoft software installer (MSI) file,‚Äù the company said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis has now been moved server-side to restrict access to the final payload.‚Äù
The latest iteration sticks to the same approach as before, distributing ZIP files (‚ÄúActualiza_Policy_v01.zip‚Äù) containing a legitimate Chrome proxy executable and a trojanized MSI file that‚Äôs engineered to drop
AllaKore RAT
, a malware with capabilities for keylogging, screenshot capture, file download/upload, and remote control. The MSI file is configured to deploy a .NET downloader, which is responsible for retrieving and launching the remote access trojan from an external server (‚Äúmanzisuape[.]com/amw‚Äù), and a PowerShell script for cleanup actions. This is not the first time AllaKore RAT has been used in attacks targeting Latin America. In May 2024, HarfangLab and Cisco Talos
revealed
that an AllaKore variant known as AllaSenha (aka CarnavalHeist) has been used to single out Brazilian banking institutions by threat actors from the country.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHaving spent those four years-plus actively targeting Mexican entities, we would deem this threat actor persistent, but not particularly advanced,‚Äù Arctic Wolf said. ‚ÄúThe strictly financial motivation of this actor coupled with their limited geographic targeting is highly distinctive.‚Äù
‚ÄúAdditionally, their operational longevity points to probable operational success ‚Äì meaning they‚Äôve found something that works for them, and they are sticking with it. Greedy Sponge has held the same infrastructure models for the duration of their campaigns.‚Äù
Attack Flow of Campaign Using Ghost Crypt
The development comes as eSentire detailed a May 2025 phishing campaign that employed a new
crypter-as-a-service
offering known as Ghost Crypt to deliver and run
PureRAT
. ‚ÄúInitial access was gained through social engineering, where the threat actor impersonated a new client and sent a PDF containing a link to a Zoho WorkDrive folder containing malicious zip files,‚Äù the Canadian company
noted
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe attacker also created a sense of urgency by calling the victim and requesting that they extract and execute the file immediately.‚Äù
Further examination of the attack chain has revealed that the malicious file contains a DLL payload that‚Äôs encrypted with Ghost Crypt, which then extracts and injects the trojan (i.e., the DLL) into a legitimate Windows csc.exe process using a technique called
process hypnosis injection
. Ghost Crypt, which was first advertised by an eponymous threat actor on cybercrime forums on April 15, 2025, offers the ability to bypass Microsoft Defender Antivirus, and serve several stealers, loaders, and trojans like Lumma, Rhadmanthys, StealC, BlueLoader, PureLoader, DCRat, and XWorm, among others. The discovery also follows the
emergence
of a new version of
Neptune RAT
(aka MasonRAT) that‚Äôs distributed via JavaScript file lures, allowing the threat actors to extract sensitive data, take screenshots, log keystrokes, drop
clipper malware
, and download additional DLL payloads. In recent months, cyber attacks have employed malicious Inno Setup installers that serve as a conduit for
Hijack Loader
(aka IDAT Loader), which then delivers the RedLine information stealer.</p>

<p>The attack ‚Äúleverages Inno Setup‚Äôs Pascal scripting capabilities to retrieve and execute the next-stage payload in a compromised or targeted host,‚Äù the Splunk Threat Research Team
said
. ‚ÄúThis technique closely resembles the approach used by a well-known malicious Inno Setup loader called
D3F@ck Loader
, which follows a similar infection pattern.‚Äù

<h2 id="how-to-advance-from-soc-manager-to-ciso"><a id="article-5"></a>How to Advance from SOC Manager to CISO?</h2>

<p>Making the move from managing a security operations center (SOC) to being a chief information security officer (CISO) is a significant career leap. Not only do you need a solid foundation of tech knowledge but also leadership skills and business smarts. This article will guide you through the practical steps and skills you‚Äôll need to nab an executive cybersecurity job and make the promotion from SOC manager to CISO a reality. Is the CISO role right for you?</p>

<p>It‚Äôs always a good idea to think about how you could move up and grow in your career. Aspiring to be a CISO can be a great career move. Additionally, certain operational tasks in cybersecurity, especially in a SOC, are becoming increasingly automated, making it vital to develop strategic and leadership skills to stay ahead. Having ambitious goals helps you, as a SOC analyst or lead, stay relevant and valuable in what is a constantly changing field.</p>

<p>However, the role of CISO is significantly different from other roles in cybersecurity and comes with its own set of challenges. So, while it is a good option, it‚Äôs not the only path and might not suit everyone‚Äôs strengths and career goals. It‚Äôs my hope that this article will lay out what being a CISO is all about so you can determine if it‚Äôs the path you want to take. Key skills for executive growth
For those looking to take on executive and leadership roles like CISO, it‚Äôs essential to develop skills beyond the scope of your typical IT role.</p>

<p>Having a comprehensive IT background is a significant advantage, especially when it comes to security vulnerabilities and how to respond to incidents. But you can‚Äôt focus solely on technical expertise at the expense of vital leadership, communication, and strategic thinking skills needed for the position of CISO. Remember: You‚Äôll have to relay complex security matters to stakeholders outside IT, and do so in a way that they can easily understand the issues at stake. Let‚Äôs break down areas you‚Äôll need for the role of executive.</p>

<p>Strategic thinking
Strategic thinking demands a firm grip on the organization‚Äôs core operations, particularly how it generates revenue and its key value streams. This perspective allows security professionals to align their efforts with business objectives, rather than operating in isolation. Business acumen
This is related to strategic thinking but emphasizes knowledge of risk management and finance. Security leaders must factor in financial impacts to justify security investments and manage risks effectively.</p>

<p>Balancing security measures with user experience and system availability is another critical aspect. If security policies are too strict, productivity can suffer; if they‚Äôre too permissive, the company can be exposed to threats. Decisions must consider the impact of security actions on the broader business environment. Communication
Effective communication is vital for translating technical details into language senior stakeholders can grasp and act upon.</p>

<p>This means avoiding jargon and abbreviations to convey information in a simplistic manner that resonates with multiple stakeholders, including executives who may not have a deep technical background. Communicating the impact of security initiatives in clear, concise language ensures decisions are well-informed and support company goals. Service management
You will have to ensure technical services meet business requirements, particularly in managing service delivery, implementing change, and resolving issues. All of this is essential for a secure and efficient IT infrastructure.</p>

<p>Knowledge of risk management as mentioned above, is fundamental in identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks. It helps align security strategies with business goals, facilitating informed decisions and resource allocation. Compliance
Being aware of compliance requirements, involving adherence to regulatory and industry standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, NIS2, PCI DSS), is critical for ensuring legal and ethical operations. Understanding these mandates helps in implementing appropriate security controls and policies.</p>

<p>Exposure to legal aspects, such as data privacy laws and intellectual property rights, broadens the perspective necessary for the CISO role and interactions with both external and internal bodies such as the
GRC
within your organization. Here, formal education, including a degree in computer science or cybersecurity, combined with continuous learning via industry courses and certifications, strengthens your expertise; it also prepares you for leadership responsibilities and demonstrates your readiness to take on the challenges that come with the job. Practical advice for career transition
To successfully transition and advance your cybersecurity career, you‚Äôll need to take concrete strategic steps toward a CISO role. Gaining visibility, building influence, and getting promoted
To advance your cybersecurity career, make your value known.</p>

<p>Share your contributions and accomplishments, both within your team and also with other departments and leadership. When presenting data, make it actionable by showing how the information drives improvements and supports business goals via tactical metrics and simple language. Also, actively look for opportunities to contribute to broader initiatives and offer solutions to challenges that extend beyond your current role and responsibilities. To set yourself apart as someone ready for a promotion to the executive level, take initiative and demonstrate a willingness to lead.</p>

<p>Avoiding common pitfalls
One common mistake is to communicate based on your or another person‚Äôs assumptions. Always verify information, and remember, opinions are not facts. Another pitfall is believing your angle or viewpoint is the only correct one. Other perspectives exist and hold value.</p>

<p>As much as possible, embrace a collaborative approach, focused on building consensus and defining the right direction rather than prioritizing speed. This means engaging in open discussions, listening to feedback, and working towards a shared understanding. This will yield a stronger foundation for initiatives and avoid potential disagreements or misinterpretations down the road. What exactly does being a CISO entail?</p>

<p>To succeed at the executive level, you need to be aware of the nuances of the CISO job, expectations depending on your company‚Äôs structure, and the different roles you‚Äôll have to fulfill before being entrusted with the title of CISO. Who does your CISO report to? The reporting structure of a chief information security officer varies widely across organizations. Often, the CISO reports to the chief information officer (CIO).</p>

<p>In this structure, security is seen as a subset of IT, focusing on the technical aspects of protecting data and systems. However, as cybersecurity risks become more business-critical, CISOs are increasingly reporting to the chief financial officer (CFO) or the chief risk officer (CRO). Reporting to the CFO emphasizes the financial impact of security breaches and the need for risk-based security investments. But if you‚Äôre reporting to the CRO, you‚Äôll need to highlight the enterprise-wide risk management perspective, ensuring security is integrated into broader organizational risk strategies.</p>

<p>The reporting line significantly influences the CISO‚Äôs priorities and scope of authority, reflecting a company‚Äôs overall security maturity and approach to risk. It‚Äôs a good idea to consider your own company‚Äôs structure and how it aligns with your career goals and potential advancement. What changes at the top: Roles &amp; expectations
Transitioning from a technical lead to an executive role like CISO entails a complete shift in expectations. As a technical lead, the focus is primarily on hands-on implementation, troubleshooting, and technical problem-solving.</p>

<p>At the executive level, the emphasis shifts to strategy, leadership, and business alignment. CISOs are expected to develop and execute a comprehensive security strategy that protects the organization‚Äôs assets while enabling business operations. This is where decision-making becomes more strategic, requiring CISOs to balance risk mitigation with business objectives. They must also effectively communicate technical risks to senior management in terms of their business impact.</p>

<p>This covers everything from budgeting and policy development to regulatory compliance and security team management. Key roles &amp; responsibilities above technical lead
Advancement from technical lead to CISO involves several intermediate roles; each one has distinct responsibilities and demands a higher level of leadership, strategic thinking, and business savvy. A
SOC manager
oversees the daily operations of the security operations center. That means making sure incident detection and response are efficient and effective.</p>

<p>Responsibilities here include managing staff, developing processes, and reporting on metrics. A
director of security
typically has a broader scope, handling multiple security functions like network security, application security, and vulnerability management. Directors develop security programs, manage budgets, and ensure compliance with regulations. The
CISO
is the top security executive, responsible for the overall security strategy and posture of the organization.</p>

<p>They align security with business goals, manage risk, and communicate with executive leadership. Becoming a CISO is a progressive journey of developing skills and taking on broader responsibilities. Summary and key takeaways
The journey from a SOC analyst or manager to CISO is a significant undertaking. You‚Äôre not just becoming a better expert but evolving into a leader who can align security with business objectives.</p>

<p>Embracing a leadership mindset involves more than just managing tasks. You need to inspire teams, influence stakeholders, and drive strategic decisions. All of this takes communication skills, strategic thinking, and business acumen to manage risks effectively and communicate complex technical information in simple terms. Be proactive in seeking visibility and influence within your organization and avoid common pitfalls like making assumptions and prioritizing speed over consensus.</p>

<p>Finally, understand the reporting structure and evolving expectations of a CISO. By setting long-term goals and embracing a leadership mindset, you can successfully navigate the transition to a CISO and thrive in what is both a challenging and rewarding role. Adaptive AI for the SOC

<h2 id="hackers-exploit-sharepoint-zero-day-since-july-7-to-steal-keys-maintain-persistent-access"><a id="article-6"></a>Hackers Exploit SharePoint Zero-Day Since July 7 to Steal Keys, Maintain Persistent Access</h2>

<p>The recently disclosed
critical Microsoft SharePoint vulnerability
has been under exploitation as early as July 7, 2025, according to findings from Check Point Research. The cybersecurity company
said
it observed first exploitation attempts targeting an unnamed major Western government, with the activity intensifying on July 18 and 19, spanning government, telecommunications, and software sectors in North America and Western Europe. Check Point also said the exploitation efforts originated from three different IP addresses ‚Äì 104.238.159[.]149, 107.191.58[.]76, and 96.9.125[.]147 ‚Äì one of which was previously tied to the weaponization of security flaws in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) appliances (
CVE-2025-4427 and CVE-2025-4428
). ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre witnessing an urgent and active threat: a critical zero-day in SharePoint on-prem is being exploited in the wild, putting thousands of global organizations at risk,‚Äù Lotem Finkelstein, Director of Threat Intelligence at Check Point Research, told The Hacker News.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOur team has confirmed dozens of compromise attempts across government, telecom, and tech sectors since July 7. We strongly urge enterprises to update their security systems immediately ‚Äì this campaign is both sophisticated and fast-moving.‚Äù
The attack chains have been observed leveraging CVE-2025-53770, a newly patched remote code execution flaw in SharePoint Server, and chaining it with CVE-2025-49706, a spoofing vulnerability that was patched by Microsoft as part of its July 2025 Patch Tuesday update, to gain initial access and escalate privileges. It‚Äôs worth mentioning at this stage that there are two sets of vulnerabilities in SharePoint that have come to light this month -
CVE-2025-49704
(CVSS score: 8.8) - Microsoft SharePoint Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (Fixed on July 8, 2025)
CVE-2025-49706
(CVSS score: 7.1) - Microsoft SharePoint Server Spoofing Vulnerability (Fixed on July 8, 2025)
CVE-2025-53770
(CVSS score: 9.8) - Microsoft SharePoint Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
CVE-2025-53771
(CVSS score: 7.1) - Microsoft SharePoint Server Spoofing Vulnerability
CVE-2025-49704 and CVE-2025-49706, collectively referred to as ToolShell, is an exploitation chain that can lead to remote code execution on SharePoint Server instances. They were
originally disclosed
by Viettel Cyber Security during the Pwn2Own 2025 hacking competition earlier this May.</p>

<p>CVE-2025-53770 and CVE-2025-53771, which became public knowledge over the weekend, have been described as variants of CVE-2025-49704 and CVE-2025-49706, respectively, indicating that they are bypasses for the original fixes put in place by Microsoft earlier this month. This is evidenced by the fact that Microsoft
acknowledged
active attacks exploiting ‚Äúvulnerabilities partially addressed by the July Security Update.‚Äù The company also noted in its advisories that the updates for CVE-2025-53770 and CVE-2025-53771 include ‚Äúmore robust protections‚Äù than the updates for CVE-2025-49704 and CVE-2025-49706. However, it bears noting that CVE-2025-53771 has not been flagged by Redmond as actively exploited in the wild. ‚ÄúCVE-2025-53770 exploits a weakness in how Microsoft SharePoint Server handles the deserialization of untrusted data,‚Äù Martin Zugec, technical solutions director at Bitdefender,
said
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAttackers are leveraging this flaw to gain unauthenticated remote code execution.‚Äù
This, in turn, is achieved by deploying malicious ASP.NET web shells that programmatically extract sensitive cryptographic keys. These stolen keys are subsequently leveraged to craft and sign malicious __VIEWSTATE payloads, thereby establishing persistent access and enabling the execution of arbitrary commands on SharePoint Server. According to Bitdefender telemetry, in-the-wild exploitation has been detected in the United States, Canada, Austria, Jordan, Mexico, Germany, South Africa, Switzerland, and the Netherlands, suggesting widespread abuse of the flaw. Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, in its own analysis of the campaign, said it observed commands being run to execute a Base64-encoded PowerShell command, which creates a file at the location ‚ÄúC:\PROGRA~1\COMMON~1\MICROS~1\WEBSER~1\16\TEMPLATE\LAYOUTS\spinstall0.aspx‚Äù and then parses its content.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe spinstall0.aspx file is a web shell that can execute various functions to retrieve ValidationKeys, DecryptionKeys, and the CompatabilityMode of the server, which are needed to forge ViewState Encryption keys,‚Äù Unit 42
said
in a threat brief. Content of spinstall0.aspx
In an advisory issued Monday, SentinelOne said it first detected exploitation on July 17, with the cybersecurity company identifying three ‚Äúdistinct attack clusters,‚Äù including state-aligned threat actors, engaging in reconnaissance and early-stage exploitation activities. Targets of the campaigns include technology consulting, manufacturing, critical infrastructure, and professional services tied to sensitive architecture and engineering organizations. ‚ÄúThe early targets suggest that the activity was initially carefully selective, aimed at organizations with strategic value or elevated access,‚Äù researchers Simon Kenin, Jim Walter, and Tom Hegel

<p>Analysis of the attack activity has revealed the use of a password-protected ASPX web shell (‚Äúxxx.aspx‚Äù) on July 18, 2025, at 9:58 a.m. GMT. The web shell supports three functions: Authentication via an embedded form, command execution via cmd.exe, and file upload. Subsequent exploitation efforts have been found to employ the ‚Äúspinstall0.aspx‚Äù web shell to extract and expose sensitive cryptographic material from the host.</p>

<p>Spinstall0.aspx is ‚Äúnot a traditional command web shell but rather a reconnaissance and persistence utility,‚Äù the researchers explained. ‚ÄúThis code extracts and prints the host‚Äôs MachineKey values, including the ValidationKey, DecryptionKey, and cryptographic mode settings ‚Äì information critical for attackers seeking to maintain persistent access across load-balanced SharePoint environments or to forge authentication tokens.‚Äù
Unlike other web shells that are typically dropped on internet-exposed servers to facilitate remote access, spinstall0.aspx appears to be designed with the sole intention of gathering cryptographic secrets that could then be used to forge authentication or session tokens across SharePoint instances. These attacks, per
CrowdStrike
, commence with a specially crafted HTTP POST request to an accessible SharePoint server via the
‚Äú/_layouts/15/ToolPane.aspx‚Äù endpoint
that attempts to write spinstall0.aspx via PowerShell. The company said it blocked hundreds of exploitation attempts across more than 160 customer environments.</p>

<p>SentinelOne also discovered a cluster dubbed ‚Äúno shell‚Äù that took a ‚Äúmore advanced and stealthy approach‚Äù to other threat actors by opting for in-memory .NET module execution without dropping any payloads on disk. The activity originated from the IP address 96.9.125[.]147. ‚ÄúThis approach significantly complicates detection and forensic recovery, underscoring the threat posed by fileless post-exploitation techniques,‚Äù the company said, positing that it‚Äôs either a ‚Äúskilled red team emulation exercise or the work of a capable threat actor with a focus on evasive access and credential harvesting.‚Äù
It‚Äôs currently not known who is behind the attack activity, although Google-owned Mandiant has
attributed
the early-exploitation to a China-aligned hacking group. Data from Censys
shows
that there are 9,762 on-premises SharePoint servers online, although it‚Äôs currently not known if all of them are susceptible to the flaws.</p>

<p>Given that SharePoint servers are a lucrative target for threat actors due to the nature of sensitive organizational data stored in them, it‚Äôs essential that users move quickly to
apply the fixes
, rotate the keys, and restart the instances. ‚ÄúWe assess that at least one of the actors responsible for the early exploitation is a China-nexus threat actor,‚Äù Charles Carmakal, CTO, Mandiant Consulting at Google Cloud,
said
in a post on LinkedIn. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre aware of victims in several sectors and global geographies. The activity primarily involved the theft of machine key material which could be used to access victim environments after the patch has been applied.‚Äù

<h2 id="iran-linked-dchspy-android-malware-masquerades-as-vpn-apps-to-spy-on-dissidents"><a id="article-7"></a>Iran-Linked DCHSpy Android Malware Masquerades as VPN Apps to Spy on Dissidents</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have unearthed new Android spyware artifacts that are likely affiliated with the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) and have been distributed to targets by masquerading as VPN apps and Starlink, a satellite internet connection service offered by SpaceX. Mobile security vendor Lookout said it discovered four samples of a surveillanceware tool it tracks as
DCHSpy
one week after the onset of the Israel-Iran conflict last month. Exactly how many people may have installed these apps is not clear. ‚ÄúDCHSpy collects WhatsApp data, accounts, contacts, SMS, files, location, and call logs, and can record audio and take photos,‚Äù security researchers Alemdar Islamoglu and Justin Albrecht
said
.</p>

<p>First detected in July 2024, DCHSpy is assessed to be the handiwork of
MuddyWater
, an Iranian nation-state group tied to MOIS. The hacking crew is also called Boggy Serpens, Cobalt Ulster, Earth Vetala, ITG17, Mango Sandstorm (formerly Mercury), Seedworm, Static Kitten, TA450, and Yellow Nix. Early iterations of DCHSPy have been identified targeting English and Farsi speakers via Telegram channels using themes that run counter to the Iranian regime. Given the use of VPN lures to advertise the malware, it‚Äôs likely that dissidents, activists, and journalists are a target of the activity.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs suspected that the newly identified DCHSpy variants are being deployed against adversaries in the wake of the recent conflict in the region by passing them off as seemingly useful services like Earth VPN (‚Äúcom.earth.earth_vpn‚Äù), Comodo VPN (‚Äúcom.comodoapp.comodovpn‚Äù), and Hide VPN (‚Äúcom.hv.hide_vpn‚Äù). Interestingly, one of the Earth VPN app samples has been
found
to be distributed in the form of APK files using the name ‚Äústarlink_vpn(1.3.0)-3012 (1).apk,‚Äù indicating that the malware is likely being spread to targets using Starlink-related lures. It‚Äôs worth noting that Starlink‚Äôs satellite internet service was
activated
in Iran last month amid a government-imposed
internet blackout
. But, weeks later, the country‚Äôs parliament
voted
to
outlaw
its use over unauthorized operations.</p>

<p>A modular trojan, DCHSpy is equipped to collect a wide range of data, including account signed-in to the device, contacts, SMS messages, call logs, files, location, ambient audio, photos, and WhatsApp information. DCHSpy also shares infrastructure with another Android malware known as
SandStrike
, which was flagged by Kaspersky in November 2022 as targeting Persian-speaking individuals by posing as seemingly harmless VPN applications. The discovery of DCHSpy is the latest instance of Android spyware that has been used to target individuals and entities in the Middle East. Other documented malware strains include
AridSpy
,
BouldSpy
,
GuardZoo
,
RatMilad
, and
SpyNote
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúDCHSpy uses similar tactics and infrastructure as SandStrike,‚Äù Lookout said. ‚ÄúIt is distributed to targeted groups and individuals by leveraging malicious URLs shared directly over messaging apps such as Telegram.‚Äù
‚ÄúThese most recent samples of DCHSpy indicate continued development and usage of the surveillanceware as the situation in the Middle East evolves, especially as Iran cracks down on its citizens following the ceasefire with Israel.‚Äù

<h2 id="china-linked-hackers-launch-targeted-espionage-campaign-on-african-it-infrastructure"><a id="article-8"></a>China-Linked Hackers Launch Targeted Espionage Campaign on African IT Infrastructure</h2>

<p>The China-linked cyber espionage group tracked as
APT41
has been attributed to a new campaign targeting government IT services in the African region. ‚ÄúThe attackers used hardcoded names of internal services, IP addresses, and proxy servers embedded within their malware,‚Äù Kaspersky researchers Denis Kulik and Daniil Pogorelov
said
. ‚ÄúOne of the C2s [command-and-control servers] was a captive SharePoint server within the victim‚Äôs infrastructure.‚Äù
APT41 is the moniker
assigned
to a prolific Chinese nation-state hacking group that‚Äôs known for targeting organizations spanning multiple sectors, including telecom and energy providers, educational institutions, healthcare organizations and IT energy companies in more than three dozen countries. What makes the campaign noteworthy is its focus on Africa, which, as the Russian cybersecurity vendor noted, ‚Äúhad experienced the least activity‚Äù from this specific threat actor.</p>

<p>That said, the findings line up with
previous observations
from Trend Micro that the continent has found itself in its crosshairs since late 2022. Kaspersky said it began an investigation after it found ‚Äúsuspicious activity‚Äù on multiple workstations associated with an unnamed organization‚Äôs IT infrastructure that involved the attackers running commands to ascertain the availability of their C2 server, either directly or via an internal proxy server within the compromised entity. ‚ÄúThe source of the suspicious activity turned out to be an unmonitored host that had been compromised,‚Äù the researchers noted. ‚Äú
Impacket
was executed on it in the context of a service account.</p>

<p>After the Atexec and WmiExec modules finished running, the attackers temporarily suspended their operations.‚Äù
Soon after, the attackers are said to have harvested credentials associated with privileged accounts to facilitate privilege escalation and lateral movement, ultimately deploying Cobalt Strike for C2 communication using DLL side-loading. The malicious DLLs incorporate a check to verify the language packs installed on the host and proceed with the execution only if the following language packs are not detected: Japanese, Korean (South Korea), Chinese (Mainland China), and Chinese (Taiwan). The attack is also characterized by the use of a hacked SharePoint server for C2 purposes, using it to send commands that are run by a C#-based malware uploaded to the victim hosts. ‚ÄúThey distributed files named agents.exe and agentx.exe via the SMB protocol to communicate with the server,‚Äù Kaspersky explained.</p>

<p>‚ÄúEach of these files is actually a C# trojan whose primary function is to execute commands it receives from a web shell named CommandHandler.aspx, which is installed on the SharePoint server.‚Äù
This method blends traditional malware deployment with living-off-the-land tactics, where trusted services like SharePoint are turned into covert control channels. These behaviors align with techniques categorized under MITRE ATT&amp;CK, including T1071.001 (Web Protocols) and T1047 (WMI), making them difficult to detect using signature-based tools alone. Furthermore, the threat actors have been spotted carrying out follow-on activity on machines deemed valuable post initial reconnaissance. This is accomplished by running a cmd.exe command to download from an external resource a malicious HTML Application (HTA) file containing embedded JavaScript and run it using mshta.exe.</p>

<p>The exact nature of the payload delivered via the external URL, a domain impersonating GitHub (‚Äúgithub.githubassets[.]net‚Äù) so as to evade detection, is currently unknown. However, an analysis of one of the previously distributed scripts shows that it‚Äôs designed to spawn a reverse shell, thereby granting the attackers the ability to execute commands on the infected system. Also put to use in the attacks are stealers and credential-harvesting utilities to gather sensitive data and exfiltrate the details via the SharePoint server. Some of the tools deployed by the adversary are listed below -
Pillager
, albeit a modified version, to steal credentials from browsers, databases, and administrative utilities like MobaXterm; source code; screenshots; chat sessions and data; email messages; SSH and FTP sessions; list of installed apps; output of the systeminfo and tasklist commands; and account information from chat apps and email clients
Checkout to steal information about downloaded files and credit card data saved in web browsers like Yandex, Opera, OperaGX, Vivaldi, Google Chrome, Brave, and C·ªëc C·ªëc.</p>

<p>RawCopy to copy raw registry files
Mimikatz to dump account credentials
‚ÄúThe attackers wield a wide array of both custom-built and publicly available tools,‚Äù Kaspersky said. ‚ÄúSpecifically, they use penetration testing tools like Cobalt Strike at various stages of an attack.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe attackers are quick to adapt to their target‚Äôs infrastructure, updating their malicious tools to account for specific characteristics. They can even leverage internal services for C2 communication and data exfiltration.‚Äù
This operation also highlights the blurred line between red team tools and real-world adversary simulation, where threat actors use public frameworks like Impacket, Mimikatz, and Cobalt Strike alongside custom implants. These overlaps pose challenges for detection teams focused on lateral movement, credential access, and defense evasion across Windows environments.</p>

Google Ships Patch for Actively Exploited Chrome Flaw
‚Äî Google out patches to resolve a high-severity vulnerability in Chrome browser (CVE-2025-6558) that has come under active exploitation in the wild, making it the fifth zero-day to be either actively abused or demonstrated as a proof-of-concept (PoC) since the start of the year. The vulnerability is an incorrect validation of untrusted input in the browser‚Äôs ANGLE and GPU components that could allow an attacker to potentially perform a sandbox escape via a crafted HTML page.</p>

<p>The issue has been addressed in versions 138.0.7204.157/.158 for Windows and Apple macOS, and 138.0.7204.157 for Linux. Critical NVIDIA Container Toolkit Flaw Disclosed
‚Äî A critical vulnerability in NVIDIA Container Toolkit (CVE-2025-23266) could be exploited to achieve code execution with elevated permissions. ‚ÄúA successful exploit of this vulnerability might lead to escalation of privileges, data tampering, information disclosure, and denial-of-service,‚Äù the GPU maker said. Wiz, which disclosed the flaw, said the shortcoming could be trivially exploited to access, steal, or manipulate the sensitive data and proprietary models of all other customers running on the same shared hardware by means of a three-line exploit.</p>

<p>New CrushFTP Bug Comes Under Attack
‚Äî CrushFTP revealed that a critical flaw in its file transfer software (CVE-2025-54309) has been exploited in the wild, with unknown threat actors reverse engineering its source code to discover the bug and target devices that are yet to be updated to the latest versions. The issue affects all versions of CrushFTP 10 before 10.8.5 and 11 before 11.3.4_23. ‚ÄúThe attack vector was HTTP(S) for how they could exploit the server,‚Äù CrushFTP said. ‚ÄúWe had fixed a different issue related to AS2 in HTTP(S) not realizing that a prior bug could be used like this exploit was.</p>

Threat Actors Target EoL SonicWall SMA 100 Devices
‚Äî Unknown intruders codenamed UNC6148 are targeting fully patched end-of-life SonicWall Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 100 series appliances and deploying a novel, persistent backdoor and rootkit called OVERWATCH.</p>

<p>Many key details about the campaign are currently unknown. For starters, Google said it does not have enough data to determine where the threat actors are based, or what their motives are. Second, the attacks are exploiting leaked local administrator credentials on the targeted devices for initial access. But it has been unable to pinpoint how the attackers managed to obtain the credentials used in the attack.</p>

<p>While it‚Äôs possible that they were sourced from infostealer logs or credential marketplaces, the company noted it‚Äôs more likely that the attackers leveraged a known vulnerability. It‚Äôs also unclear precisely what the attackers are trying to accomplish after they take control of a device. The lack of information largely stems from how OVERWATCH functions, which allows the attackers to selectively remove log entries to hinder forensic investigation. The investigation also found that UNC6148 also managed to deploy a reverse shell on infected devices, something that should not normally be possible, leading to speculations that a zero-day might have been in play.</p>

<p>The findings once again show network appliances are popular attacker targets, as they offer a way to gain access to high-value networks. ‚ÄéÔ∏è‚Äçüî• Trending CVEs

Storm-1516 Spreads Disinformation in Europe
‚Äî A Kremlin-linked disinformation group tracked as Storm-1516 has been masquerading as real journalists and publishing fake articles on spoofed news websites to spread false narratives in France, Armenia, Germany, Moldova, and Norway. The threat actors used the names and photos of legitimate reporters to lend credibility to the bogus articles, per the
Gnida Project
.</p>

<p>Another pro-Russia disinformation campaign known as Operation Overload (aka Matryoshka or Storm-1679) has been observed leveraging consumer-grade artificial intelligence tools to fuel a ‚Äúcontent explosion‚Äù focused around exacerbating existing tensions around global elections, Ukraine, and immigration, among other controversial issues. The activity, operating since 2023, has a track record of disseminating false narratives by impersonating media outlets with the apparent aim of sowing discord in democratic countries. ‚ÄúThis marks a shift toward more scalable, multilingual, and increasingly sophisticated propaganda tactics,‚Äù Reset Tech and Check First
said
. ‚ÄúThe campaign has substantially amped up the production of new content in the past eight months, signalling a shift toward faster, more scalable content creation methods.‚Äù Some of the images used in the campaign are believed to have been generated using Flux AI, a text-to-image generator developed by Black Forest Labs.</p>

Abacus Market Shutters After Likely Exit Scam
‚Äî The darknet marketplace known as Abacus Market has suddenly closed its operations, rendering all its infrastructure, including its clearnet mirror, inaccessible. The development comes after Abacus Market users began reporting withdrawal issues in late June 2025. Blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs
said
the marketplace‚Äôs creators may have possibly pulled off an exit scam and disappeared with users‚Äô funds, although the possibility of a law enforcement seizure hasn‚Äôt been ruled out. Abacus‚Äôs exit follows the June 16, 2025,

U.S. Ex-Army soldier Pleads Guilty to Hacking 10 Telcos
‚Äî Former U.S.</p>

<p>Army soldier Cameron John Wagenius (aka kiberphant0m and cyb3rph4nt0m) pleaded guilty to hacking and extorting at least 10 telecommunications companies between April 2023 and December 2024. The 21-year-old ‚Äúconspired with others to defraud at least 10 victim organizations by obtaining login credentials for the organizations‚Äô protected computer networks,‚Äù the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ)
said
. ‚ÄúThe conspirators obtained these credentials using a hacking tool that they called SSH Brute, among other means.</p>

<p>They used Telegram group chats to transfer stolen credentials and discuss gaining unauthorized access to victim companies‚Äô networks.‚Äù The threat actors behind the scheme then extorted the victim organizations both privately and on cybercrime forums such as BreachForums and XSS.is by offering to sell the stolen data for thousands of dollars. Some of the data was eventually sold and used to perpetuate other frauds, including SIM-swapping. Wagenius et al are said to have attempted to extort at least $1 million from victim data owners. The attacks took place while Wagenius was on active duty, the DoJ said.</p>

<p>Court documents show that the defendant Googled for phrases like ‚Äúcan hacking be treason‚Äù and ‚ÄúU.S. military personnel defecting to Russia.‚Äù In February 2025, Wagenius
pleaded guilty
to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, extortion in relation to computer fraud, aggravated identity theft, and unlawful transfer of confidential phone records information. He is scheduled for sentencing on October 6, 2025. His alleged co-conspirators, Connor Moucka and John Binns, were
indicted
in November 2024.</p>

<p>Signed Drivers in Malicious Campaigns
‚Äî Since 2020, no less than 620 signed drivers, 80 certificates, and 60 Windows Hardware Compatibility Program (
WHCP
) accounts have been associated with threat actor campaigns. The majority of drivers have been signed by 131 Chinese companies. In 2022 alone, over 250 drivers and roughly 34 certificates and WHCP accounts were identified as potentially compromised. The findings show that ‚Äúkernel-level attacks remain highly attractive to threat actors despite Microsoft‚Äôs improved defenses, due to the highest level of privileges on the compromised system and control they offer to attackers,‚Äù Group-IB
said
, adding it found overlap in the signing infrastructure across different malware campaigns, such as those using POORTRY and RedDriver.</p>

<p>Some of the notable malware strains using kernel loaders for added stealth include Festi, FiveSys, FK_Undead, and BlackMoon. ‚ÄúAttackers leverage many signing certificates and WHCP accounts by exploiting legitimate processes like the WHCP and Extended Validation (EV) certificates. This includes those belonging to compromised or fraudulently registered organizations, signing malicious drivers, bypassing established security measures, and exploiting the trust model inherent in signed kernel drivers,‚Äù the company noted. TeleMessage SGNL Flaw Seeing Exploitation Activity
‚Äî Threat actors are actively attempting to exploit a security flaw in TeleMessage SGNL, an enterprise messaging system modeled after Signal, used by government agencies and enterprises alike to achieve secure communications.</p>

<p>The vulnerability,

Katz Stealer and Octalyn Stealer Detailed
‚Äî Cybersecurity company SentinelOne is warning that threat actors are increasingly adopting an information stealer called
Katz Stealer
owing to its ‚Äúrobust credential and data discovery with theft capabilities as well as modern evasion and anti-analysis features.‚Äù It described the stealer as a ‚Äúcombination of credential theft and modern malware design.‚Äù Offered under a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) model for a mere $50 per month (or $360 for a whole year), stealers such as Katz are turnkey tools that lower the barrier to entry for pulling off malicious attacks. A notable feature of Katz Stealer is its ability to defeat Chromium‚Äôs app-bound encryption to gain access to and extract credentials and cookies. ‚ÄúKatz Stealer is not a ‚Äòone shot‚Äô infostealer; it is designed to continually exfiltrate the victim‚Äôs data,‚Äù SentinelOne
said
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe malware not only extracts data found on a targeted system at the point of infection but also as data updated, changed, or freshly introduced.‚Äù Another new stealer masquerades as an educational tool called Octalyn Forensic Toolkit, but acts as a credential stealer, harvesting browser data, Discord and Telegram tokens, VPN configurations, gaming accounts, and cryptocurrency wallet artifacts. ‚ÄúIts modular C++ payload, Delphi-based builder, Telegram-based C2, and secondary payload delivery capability make it a potent tool for threat actors,‚Äù CYFIRMA

Attackers often use Windows Scheduled Tasks to stay hidden on systems.</p>

<p>Some go a step further by removing key registry values like SD (Security Descriptor) or Index, making their tasks invisible to common tools like Task Scheduler, schtasks, or even Autoruns. These hidden tasks still run in the background and can be used for persistence or malware delivery. To check for visible tasks, tools like Autoruns (by Sysinternals) and TaskSchedulerView (by NirSoft) are great starting points. They show active tasks and let you spot unusual ones.</p>

<p>But hidden tasks require deeper digging. You can use PowerShell to scan the registry path HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Schedule\TaskCache\Tree and look for tasks with missing SD values. For more advanced checks, use Sysmon to track changes in the TaskCache registry and ProcMon to monitor registry activity in real time. Look for suspicious task names, missing values, or tasks with an Index of 0.</p>

<p>Also, set alerts for Event ID 4698, which logs new scheduled task creation. In short: use both visual tools and registry checks to uncover hidden scheduled tasks. Regular scans, baseline comparisons, and basic alerting can help catch threats early‚Äîbefore they do damage. Conclusion
What‚Äôs becoming clearer each week is that attacker sophistication isn‚Äôt the exception‚Äîit‚Äôs the baseline.</p>

<p>AI-driven reconnaissance, credential abuse, and signal mimicry are no longer advanced‚Äîthey‚Äôre routine.

<h2 id="assessing-the-role-of-ai-in-zero-trust"><a id="article-10"></a>Assessing the Role of AI in Zero Trust</h2>

<p>By 2025, Zero Trust has evolved from a conceptual framework into an essential pillar of modern security. No longer merely theoretical, it‚Äôs now a requirement that organizations must adopt. A robust, defensible architecture built on Zero Trust principles does more than satisfy baseline regulatory mandates. It underpins cyber resilience, secures third-party partnerships, and ensures uninterrupted business operations.</p>

<p>In turn,
more than 80% of organizations
plan to implement Zero Trust strategies by 2026,
according to a recent Zscaler report
. In the context of Zero Trust, artificial intelligence (AI) can assist greatly as a tool for implementing automation around adaptive trust and continuous risk evaluation. In a Zero Trust architecture, access decisions must adapt continuously to changing factors such as device posture, user behavior, location, workload sensitivity, and more. This constant evaluation generates massive volumes of data, far beyond what human teams can process alone.</p>

<p>AI is key to managing that scale, playing a critical role across all five of
CISA‚Äôs Zero Trust pillars
‚Äîidentity, devices, networks, applications, and data. By filtering signal from noise, AI can help detect intrusions, identify malware, and apply behavioral analytics to flag anomalies that would be nearly impossible to catch manually. For example, if a user suddenly downloads sensitive files at 2 a.m. from an unusual location, AI models trained on behavioral baselines can flag the event, assess the risk, and trigger actions like reauthentication or session termination.</p>

<p>This enables adaptive trust: access that adjusts in real time based on risk, supported by automation so the system can respond immediately without waiting on human intervention. Predictive vs. Generative AI: Different Tools, Different Purposes
There are two primary categories of AI relevant to Zero Trust: predictive models and generative models. Predictive AI
, including machine learning and deep learning, is trained on historical data to identify patterns, behaviors, and early indicators of compromise.</p>

<p>These models power detection and prevention systems‚Äîsuch as EDRs, intrusion detection platforms, and behavioral analytics engines‚Äîthat help catch threats early in the attack chain. When it comes to Zero Trust, predictive AI supports the control plane by feeding real-time signals into dynamic policy enforcement. It enables continuous evaluation of access requests by scoring context: is the device compliant? Is the login location unusual?</p>

<p>Is the behavior consistent with baseline activity? Generative AI
, such as large language models like ChatGPT and Gemini, serves a different purpose. These systems are not predictive and don‚Äôt enforce controls. Instead, they support human operators by summarizing information, generating queries, accelerating scripting, and providing faster access to relevant context.</p>

<p>In high-tempo security environments, this functionality helps reduce friction and allows analysts to triage and investigate more efficiently. Agentic AI
takes large language models beyond support roles into active participants in security workflows. By wrapping an LLM in a lightweight ‚Äúagent‚Äù that can call APIs, execute scripts, and adapt its behavior based on real-time feedback, you gain a self-driving automation layer that orchestrates complex Zero Trust tasks end to end. For example, an agentic AI could automatically gather identity context, adjust network micro-segmentation policies, spin up temporary access workflows, and then revoke privileges once a risk threshold is cleared, all without manual intervention.</p>

<p>This evolution not only accelerates response times, but also ensures consistency and scalability, letting your team focus on strategic threat hunting while routine enforcement and remediation happen reliably in the background. These approaches all have a place in a Zero Trust model. Predictive AI enhances automated enforcement by driving real-time risk scoring. Generative AI enables defenders to move faster and make better-informed decisions, especially in time-sensitive or high-volume scenarios.</p>

<p>Agentic AI brings orchestration and end-to-end automation into the mix, letting you automatically adjust policies, remediate risks, and revoke privileges without manual intervention. The strength of a Zero Trust architecture lies in applying it where it fits best. Human-Machine Teaming: Working in Tandem
Despite their growing roles, AI models alone can‚Äôt serve as the sole ‚Äúbrain‚Äù of a Zero Trust architecture. Predictive AI, generative AI, and agentic AI each act more like specialized co-pilot analysts‚Äîsurfacing patterns, summarizing context, or orchestrating workflows based on real-time signals.</p>

<p>True Zero Trust still relies on human-defined policy logic, rigorous system-level design, and ongoing oversight to ensure that automated actions align with your security objectives. That‚Äôs especially important because AI is not immune to manipulation. The
SANS Critical AI Security Guidelines
outline risks, including model poisoning, inference tampering, and vector database manipulation‚Äîall of which can be used to subvert Zero Trust enforcement if the AI system is blindly trusted. This is why our
SANS SEC530 Defensible Security Architecture &amp; Engineering: Implementing Zero Trust for the Hybrid Enterprise
course emphasizes the concept of human-machine teaming.</p>

<p>AI automates data analysis and response recommendations, but humans must set boundaries and validate those outputs within the broader security architecture. Whether that means writing tighter enforcement rules or segmenting access to model outputs, the control stays with the operator. This model of collaboration is increasingly being recognized as the most sustainable way forward. Machines can outpace humans when it comes to processing volume, but they may lack certain business context, creativity, and ethical reasoning that only humans bring.</p>

<p>Practitioners ‚Äì ‚Äúall-around defenders‚Äù, as I like to call them - remain essential not just for incident response, but for designing resilient enforcement strategies, interpreting ambiguous scenarios, and making the judgment calls that machines can‚Äôt. The future of Zero Trust isn‚Äôt AI replacing human. It‚Äôs AI amplifying the human, surfacing actionable insight, accelerating investigation, and scaling enforcement decisions without removing human control. Ready for More Insight?</p>

<p>For a deeper dive on AI‚Äôs role in Zero Trust,
SANS Certified Instructor Josh Johnson
will be teaching SEC530 at our
SANS DC Metro Fall 2025 live training event

<h2 id="poisonseed-hackers-bypass-fido-keys-using-qr-phishing-and-cross-device-sign-in-abuse"><a id="article-11"></a>PoisonSeed Hackers Bypass FIDO Keys Using QR Phishing and Cross-Device Sign-In Abuse</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a novel attack technique that allows threat actors to downgrade Fast IDentity Online (
FIDO
) key protections by deceiving users into approving authentication requests from spoofed company login portals. FIDO keys are hardware- or software-based authenticators designed to eliminate phishing by binding logins to specific domains using public-private key cryptography. In this case, attackers exploit a legitimate feature‚Äîcross-device sign-in‚Äîto trick victims into unknowingly authenticating malicious sessions. The activity, observed by Expel as part of a phishing campaign in the wild, has been attributed to a threat actor named
PoisonSeed
, which was recently flagged as leveraging compromised credentials associated with customer relationship management (CRM) tools and bulk email providers to send spam messages containing cryptocurrency seed phrases and drain victims‚Äô digital wallets.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe attacker does this by taking advantage of cross-device sign-in features available with FIDO keys,‚Äù researchers Ben Nahorney and Brandon Overstreet
said
. ‚ÄúHowever, the bad actors in this case are using this feature in adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks.‚Äù
This technique doesn‚Äôt work in all scenarios. It specifically targets users authenticating via cross-device flows that don‚Äôt enforce strict proximity checks‚Äîsuch as Bluetooth or local device attestation. If a user‚Äôs environment mandates hardware security keys plugged directly into the login device, or uses platform-bound authenticators (like Face ID tied to the browser context), the attack chain breaks.</p>

<p>Cross-device sign-in
allows users to sign-in on a device that does not have a passkey using a second device that does hold the cryptographic key, such as a mobile phone. The attack chain documented by Expel commences with a phishing email that lures recipients to log into a fake sign-in page mimicking the enterprise‚Äôs Okta portal. Once the victims enter their credentials, the sign-in information is stealthily relayed by the bogus site to the real login page. The phishing site then instructs the legitimate login page to use the hybrid transport method for authentication, which causes the page to serve a QR code that‚Äôs subsequently sent back to the phishing site and presented to the victim.</p>

<p>Should the user scan the QR code with the authenticator app on their mobile device, it allows the attackers to gain unauthorized access to the victim‚Äôs account. ‚ÄúIn the case of this attack, the bad actors have entered the correct username and password and requested cross-device sign-in,‚Äù Expel said. ‚ÄúThe login portal displays a QR code, which the phishing site immediately captures and relays back to the user on the fake site. The user scans it with their MFA authenticator, the login portal and the MFA authenticator communicate, and the attackers are in.‚Äù
What makes the attack noteworthy is that it gets around protections offered by FIDO keys and enables threat actors to obtain access to users‚Äô accounts.</p>

<p>The compromise method does not exploit any flaw in the FIDO implementation. Rather, it abuses a legitimate feature to downgrade the authentication process. While FIDO2 is designed to resist phishing, its cross-device login flow‚Äîknown as hybrid transport‚Äîcan be misused if proximity verification like Bluetooth is not enforced. In this flow, users can log in on a desktop by scanning a QR code with a mobile device that holds their passkey.</p>

<p>However, attackers can intercept and relay that QR code in real time via a phishing site, tricking users into approving the authentication on a spoofed domain. This turns a secure feature into a phishing loophole‚Äînot due to a protocol flaw, but due to its flexible implementation. Expel also said it observed a separate incident where a threat actor enrolled their own FIDO key after compromising an account through a phishing email and resetting the user‚Äôs password. To better protect user accounts, organizations should pair FIDO2 authentication with checks that verify the device being used.</p>

<p>When possible, logins should happen on the same device holding the passkey, which limits phishing risk. Security teams should watch for unusual QR code logins or new passkey enrollments. Account recovery options should use phishing-resistant methods, and login screens‚Äîespecially for cross-device sign-ins‚Äîshould show helpful details like location, device type, or clear warnings to help users spot suspicious activity. If anything, the findings underscore the need for adopting phishing-resistant authentication at all steps in an account lifecycle, including during recovery phases, as using an authentication method that‚Äôs susceptible to phishing can undermine the entire identity infrastructure.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAitM attacks against FIDO keys and attacker-controlled FIDO keys are just the latest in a long line of examples where bad actors and defenders up the ante in the fight to compromise/protect user accounts,‚Äù the researchers added. (The story was updated after publication to make it more clear that the attack technique does not bypass FIDO protections and that it downgrades the authentication to a method that‚Äôs susceptible to phishing.)

<h2 id="microsoft-releases-urgent-patch-for-sharepoint-rce-flaw-exploited-in-ongoing-cyber-attacks"><a id="article-12"></a>Microsoft Releases Urgent Patch for SharePoint RCE Flaw Exploited in Ongoing Cyber Attacks</h2>

<p>Microsoft on Sunday
released
security patches for an
actively exploited security flaw in SharePoint
and also disclosed details of another vulnerability that it said has been addressed with ‚Äúmore robust protections.‚Äù
The tech giant acknowledged it‚Äôs ‚Äúaware of active attacks targeting on-premises SharePoint Server customers by exploiting vulnerabilities partially addressed by the July Security Update.‚Äù
CVE-2025-53770
(CVSS score: 9.8), as the exploited vulnerability is tracked, concerns a case of remote code execution that arises due to the deserialization of untrusted data in on-premise versions of Microsoft SharePoint Server. The newly disclosed shortcoming is a spoofing flaw in SharePoint (
CVE-2025-53771
, CVSS score: 7.1). Viettel Cyber Security and an anonymous researcher has been credited with discovering and reporting the bug. ‚ÄúImproper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory (‚Äòpath traversal‚Äô) in Microsoft Office SharePoint allows an authorized attacker to perform spoofing over a network,‚Äù Microsoft said in an advisory released on July 20, 2025.</p>

<p>Microsoft also noted that CVE-2025-53770 and CVE-2025-53771 are related to two other SharePoint vulnerabilities documented by CVE-2025-49704 and CVE-2025-49706, which could be chained to achieve remote code execution. The exploit chain, referred to as ToolShell, was patched as part of the company‚Äôs July 2025 Patch Tuesday update. ‚ÄúThe update for CVE-2025-53770 includes more robust protections than the update for CVE-2025-49704,‚Äù the Windows maker said. ‚ÄúThe update for CVE-2025-53771 includes more robust protections than the update for CVE-2025-49706.‚Äù
It‚Äôs worth noting that Microsoft previously characterized CVE-2025-53770 as a variant of CVE-2025-49706.</p>

<p>When reached for comment about this discrepancy, a Microsoft spokesperson told The Hacker News that ‚Äúit is prioritizing getting updates out to customers while also correcting any content inaccuracies as necessary.‚Äù
The company also said that the current published content is correct and that the previous inconsistency does not impact the company‚Äôs guidance for customers. Both the identified flaws apply to on-premises SharePoint Servers only, and do not impact SharePoint Online in Microsoft 365. The issues have been addressed in the versions below (for now) -
Microsoft SharePoint Server 2019 (
16.0.10417.20027
)
Microsoft SharePoint Enterprise Server 2016 (
16.0.5508.1000
)
Microsoft SharePoint Server Subscription Edition
Microsoft SharePoint Server 2019 Core
Microsoft SharePoint Server 2019 Language Pack
Microsoft SharePoint Enterprise Server 2016
Microsoft SharePoint Enterprise Server 2016 Language Pack
To mitigate potential attacks, customers are recommended to -
Use supported versions of on-premises SharePoint Server (SharePoint Server 2016, 2019, and SharePoint Subscription Edition)
Apply the latest security updates
Ensure the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) is turned on and enable
Full Mode
for optimal protection, along with an appropriate antivirus solution such as Defender Antivirus
Deploy Microsoft Defender for Endpoint protection, or equivalent threat solutions
Rotate SharePoint Server ASP.NET machine keys
‚ÄúAfter applying the latest security updates above or enabling AMSI, it is critical that customers rotate SharePoint server ASP.NET machine keys and restart IIS on all SharePoint servers,‚Äù Microsoft said. ‚ÄúIf you cannot enable AMSI, you will need to rotate your keys after you install the new security update.‚Äù
The development comes as Eye Security told The Hacker News that at least 54 organizations have been compromised, including banks, universities, and government entities.</p>

<p>Active exploitation is said to have commenced around July 18, according to the company. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), for its part,
added
CVE-2025-53770 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (
KEV
) catalog, requiring Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to apply the fixes by July 21, 2025. Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, which is also tracking what it described as a ‚Äúhigh-impact, ongoing threat campaign,‚Äù said government, schools, healthcare, including hospitals, and large enterprise companies are at immediate risk.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAttackers are bypassing identity controls, including MFA and SSO, to gain privileged access,‚Äù Michael Sikorski, CTO and Head of Threat Intelligence for Unit 42 at Palo Alto Networks, told The Hacker News. ‚ÄúOnce inside, they‚Äôre exfiltrating sensitive data, deploying persistent backdoors, and stealing cryptographic keys. The attackers have leveraged this vulnerability to get into systems and are already establishing their foothold. ‚ÄúIf you have SharePoint on-prem exposed to the internet, you should assume that you have been compromised at this point.</p>

<p>Patching alone is insufficient to fully evict the threat. What makes this especially concerning is SharePoint‚Äôs deep integration with Microsoft‚Äôs platform, including their services like Office, Teams, OneDrive and Outlook, which have all the information valuable to an attacker. A compromise doesn‚Äôt stay contained‚Äîit opens the door to the entire network.‚Äù
The cybersecurity vendor has also classified it as a high-severity, high-urgency threat, urging organizations running on-premises Microsoft SharePoint servers to apply the necessary patches with immediate effect, rotate all cryptographic material, and engage in incident response efforts. ‚ÄúAn immediate, band-aid fix would be to unplug your Microsoft SharePoint from the internet until a patch is available,‚Äù Sikorski added.</p>

<p>‚ÄúA false sense of security could result in prolonged exposure and widespread compromise.‚Äù
(The story was updated after publication on July 22, 2025, to include details of the latest fixes and change the CVSS score of CVE-2025-53771 from 6.3 to 7.1 based on Microsoft‚Äôs advisory.)

<p>Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE) has released security updates to address a critical security flaw affecting Instant On Access Points that could allow an attacker to bypass authentication and gain administrative access to susceptible systems. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-37103, carries a CVSS score of 9.8 out of a maximum of 10.0. ‚ÄúHard-coded login credentials were found in HPE Networking Instant On Access Points, allowing anyone with knowledge of it to bypass normal device authentication,‚Äù the company
said
in an advisory. ‚ÄúSuccessful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to gain administrative access to the system.‚Äù
Also patched by HPE is an authenticated command injection flaw in the command-line interface of the HPE Networking Instant On Access Points (CVE-2025-37102, CVSS score: 7.2) that a remote attacker could exploit with elevated permissions to run arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system as a privileged user.</p>

<p>This also means that an attacker could fashion CVE-2025-37103 and CVE-2025-37102 into an exploit chain, allowing them to obtain administrative access and inject malicious commands into the command-line interface for follow-on activity. The company credited ZZ from Ubisectech Sirius Team for discovering and reporting the two issues. Both vulnerabilities have been resolved in HPE Networking Instant On software version 3.2.1.0 and above. HPE also noted in its advisory that other devices, such as HPE Networking Instant On Switches, are not affected.</p>

<p>While there is no evidence that either of the flaws has come under active exploitation, users are advised to apply the updates as soon as possible to mitigate potential threats. Found this article interesting? Follow us on
