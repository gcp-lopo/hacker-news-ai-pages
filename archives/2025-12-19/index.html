<h2 id="china-aligned-threat-group-uses-windows-group-policy-to-deploy-espionage-malware"><a id="article-1"></a>China-Aligned Threat Group Uses Windows Group Policy to Deploy Espionage Malware</h2>

<p>A previously undocumented China-aligned threat cluster dubbed LongNosedGoblin has been attributed to a series of cyber attacks targeting governmental entities in Southeast Asia and Japan. The end goal of these attacks is cyber espionage, Slovak cybersecurity company ESET said in a report published today. The threat activity cluster has been assessed to be active since at least September 2023. “LongNosedGoblin uses Group Policy to deploy malware across the compromised network, and cloud services (e.g., Microsoft OneDrive and Google Drive) as command and control (C&amp;C) servers,” security researchers Anton Cherepanov and Peter Strýček
said
.</p>

<p>Group Policy
is a mechanism for managing settings and permissions on Windows machines. According to Microsoft, Group Policy can be used to define configurations for groups of users and client computers, as well as manage server computers. The attacks are characterized by the use of a varied custom toolset that mainly consists of C#/.NET applications -
NosyHistorian, to collect browser history from Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox
NosyDoor, a backdoor that uses Microsoft OneDrive as C&amp;C and executes commands that allow it to exfiltrate files, delete files, and execute shell commands
NosyStealer, to exfiltrate browser data from Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge to Google Drive in the form of an encrypted TAR archive
NosyDownloader, to download and run a payload in memory, such as NosyLogger
NosyLogger, a modified version of
DuckSharp
that’s used to log keystrokes
NosyDoor execution chain
ESET said it first detected activity associated with the hacking group in February 2024 on a system of a governmental entity in Southeast Asia, eventually finding that Group Policy was used to deliver the malware to multiple systems from the same organization. The exact initial access methods used in the attacks are presently unknown.</p>

<p>Further analysis has determined that while many victims were affected by NosyHistorian between January and March 2024, only a subset of these victims were infected with NosyDoor, indicating a more targeted approach. In some cases, the dropper used to deploy the backdoor using
AppDomainManager injection
has been found to contain “execution guardrails” that are designed to limit operation to specific victims’ machines. Also employed by LongNosedGoblin are other tools like a reverse SOCKS5 proxy, a utility that’s used to run a video recorder to capture audio and video, and a Cobalt Strike loader. The cybersecurity company noted that the threat actor’s tradecraft shares tenuous overlaps with clusters tracked as
ToddyCat
and
Erudite Mogwai
, but emphasized the lack of definitive evidence linking them together.</p>

<p>That said, the similarities between NosyDoor and
LuckyStrike Agent
and the presence of the phrase “Paid Version” in the PDB path of LuckyStrike Agent have raised the possibility that the malware may be sold or licensed to other threat actors. “We later identified another instance of a NosyDoor variant targeting an organization in an E.U country, once again employing different TTPs, and using the Yandex Disk cloud service as a C&amp;C server,” the researchers noted. “The use of this NosyDoor variant suggests that the malware may be shared among multiple China-aligned threat groups.”

<h2 id="hpe-oneview-flaw-rated-cvss-100-allows-unauthenticated-remote-code-execution"><a id="article-2"></a>HPE OneView Flaw Rated CVSS 10.0 Allows Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution</h2>

<p>Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) has resolved a maximum-severity security flaw in OneView Software that, if successfully exploited, could result in remote code execution. The critical vulnerability, assigned the CVE identifier
CVE-2025-37164
, carries a CVSS score of 10.0. HPE
OneView
is an IT infrastructure management software that streamlines IT operations and controls all systems via a centralized dashboard interface. “A potential security vulnerability has been identified in Hewlett Packard Enterprise OneView Software.</p>

<p>This vulnerability could be exploited, allowing a remote unauthenticated user to perform remote code execution,” HPE
said
in an advisory issued this week. It affects all versions of the software prior to
version 11.00
, which addresses the flaw. The company has also made available a hotfix that can be applied to OneView versions 5.20 through 10.20. It’s worth noting that the hotfix must be reapplied after upgrading from version 6.60 or later to version 7.00.00, or after any HPE Synergy Composer reimaging operations.</p>

<p>Separate hotfixes are available for the OneView virtual appliance and Synergy Composer2. Although HPE makes no mention of the flaw being exploited in the wild, it’s essential that users apply the patches as soon as possible for optimal protection. Earlier this June, the company also
released
updates to fix eight vulnerabilities in its StoreOnce data backup and deduplication solution that could result in an authentication bypass and remote code execution. It also shipped OneView version 10.00 to remediate a number of known flaws in third-party components, such as Apache Tomcat and Apache HTTP Server.</p>

<h2 id="threatsday-bulletin-whatsapp-hijacks-mcp-leaks-ai-recon-react2shell-exploit-and-15-more-stories"><a id="article-3"></a>ThreatsDay Bulletin: WhatsApp Hijacks, MCP Leaks, AI Recon, React2Shell Exploit and 15 More Stories</h2>

<p>This week’s ThreatsDay Bulletin tracks how attackers keep reshaping old tools and finding new angles in familiar systems. Small changes in tactics are stacking up fast, and each one hints at where the next big breach could come from. From shifting infrastructures to clever social hooks, the week’s activity shows just how fluid the threat landscape has become. Here’s the full rundown of what moved in the cyber world this week.</p>

<p>International scam ring busted
Fraudulent Call Centers Disrupted in Ukraine
Authorities from the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, and Ukraine, along with Eurojust,
took action
against a criminal network operating call centers in Dnipro, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Kyiv that scammed more than 400 victims across Europe out of more than €10 million ($11.7 million). “The criminal group established a professional organisation with employees who received a percentage of the proceeds for each completed scam,” Eurojust
said
. “The fraudsters used various scams, such as posing as police officers to withdraw money using their victims’ cards and details, or pretending that their victims’ bank accounts had been hacked. They convinced their victims to transfer large sums of money from their ‘compromised’ bank accounts to ‘safe’ bank accounts controlled by the network.</p>

<p>They also lured victims into downloading remote access software and entering their banking details, enabling the criminal group to access and control the victims’ bank accounts.” The call centers employed approximately 100 people and were recruited from the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, and other countries. They played different roles, ranging from making calls and forging official certificates from the police and banks to collecting cash from their victims. Employees who successfully managed to obtain money from their victims would receive up to 7% of the proceeds to encourage them to continue the scam. The criminal enterprise also promised cash bonuses, cars, or apartments in Kyiv for employees who obtained more than €100,000.</p>

<p>The operation led to the arrest of 12 suspects on December 9, 2025. Authorities also seized cash, 21 vehicles, and various weapons and ammunition. UK nudity filter push
U.K. to Encourage Apple and Google to Put Nudity-Blocking Systems on Phones
The U.K.</p>

<p>government reportedly will “encourage” Apple and Google to prevent phones from displaying nude images except when users verify that they are adults. According to a new report from The Financial Times, the push for nudity-detection won’t be a legal requirement “for now,” but is said to be part of the government’s strategy to tackle violence against women and girls. “The U.K. government wants technology companies to block explicit images on phones and computers by default to protect children, with adults having to verify their age to create and access such content,” the report
said
.</p>

<p>“Ministers want the likes of Apple and Google to incorporate nudity-detection algorithms into their device operating systems to prevent users from taking photos or sharing images of genitalia unless they are verified as adults.”
Modular infostealer emerges
New SantaStealer Spotted
A new, modular information stealer named SantaStealer is being advertised by Russian-speaking operators on Telegram and underground forums like Lolz. “The malware collects and exfiltrates sensitive documents, credentials, wallets, and data from a broad range of applications, and aims to operate entirely in-memory to avoid file-based detection,” Rapid7
said
. “Stolen data is then compressed, split into 10 MB chunks, and sent to a C2 server over unencrypted HTTP.” SantaStealer uses 14 distinct data-collection modules, each running in its own thread and exfiltrating the stolen information. It also uses an embedded DLL to bypass Chrome’s app-bound encryption protections and harvest browser credentials, including passwords, cookies, and saved credit cards from the web browser.</p>

<p>Assessed to be a rebranding of BluelineStealer, the malware is available for $175 per month for a basic plan and $300 per month for a premium plan that lets customers edit execution delays and enable clipper functionality to substitute wallet addresses copied to the clipboard with an attacker-controlled one to reroute transactions. The threat actor has been active on Telegram since at least July 2025. Bulletproof hosting exposed
Deep Dive on BPH Providers
Threat actors leveraging Bulletproof Hosting (BPH) providers move faster than defenders can respond, often migrating operations, re-registering domains, and re-establishing services within hours of takedowns, Silent Push said in a new exhaustive analysis of BPH services. “Without knowledge of where this infrastructure shifts, takedowns lack the permanence they need,” Silent Push
said
.</p>

<p>“And without a coordinated shift in both regulatory pressure and the law-enforcement action aimed at these providers, […] Bulletproof Hosting as a service will continue to thrive – as will the malicious operations built on top of it.”
C2 servers tracked
DDoSia Infrastructure Analysis
An analysis of
DDoSia’s
multi-layered command-and-control (C2) infrastructure has revealed an average of 6 control servers active at any given time. “However, servers typically have a relatively short lifespan — averaging 2.53 days,” Censys
said
. “Some servers we have observed are active for over a week, but most instances we only see for less than a few hours.” DDoSia is a participatory distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) capability built by Russian hacktivists in 2022, coinciding with the early days of the Russo-Ukrainian war. It’s operated by the pro-Russian hacktivist group NoName057(16), which was taken down earlier this July.</p>

<p>It has since made a comeback. Targeting of DDoSia is heavily focused on Ukraine, European allies, and NATO states in government, military, transportation, public utilities, financial, and tourism sectors. WhatsApp hijack campaign
GhostPairing Attack Hijacks WhatsApp Accounts
Threat actors are using a new social engineering technique to hijack WhatsApp accounts. The new GhostPairing attack lures victims by sending messages from compromised accounts that contain a link to a Facebook-style preview.</p>

<p>Clicking on the link takes the victim to a page that imitates a Facebook viewer and asks them to verify before the content can be served. As part of this step, they are either asked to scan a QR code that will link an attacker’s browser to the victim’s WhatsApp account, granting them unauthorized access to the victim’s account. “To abuse this flow, an attacker would open WhatsApp Web in their own browser, capture the QR code shown there, and embed it into the fake Facebook viewer page. The victim would then be told to open WhatsApp, go to Linked devices, and scan that QR in order to ‘view the photo,’” Gen Digital
said
.</p>

<p>Alternately, they are instructed to enter their phone number on the bogus page, which then forwards that number to WhatsApp’s legitimate “link device via phone number” feature. Once WhatsApp generates a pairing numeric code, it’s relayed back to the fake page, along with instructions to enter the code into WhatsApp to confirm a login. The attack, which abuses the legitimate device-linking feature on the platform, is a variation of a technique that was
used
by Russian state-sponsored actors to intercept Signal messages earlier this year. To check for any signs of compromise, users can navigate to Settings -&gt; Linked Devices.</p>

<p>RuTube malware lure
RuTube Becomes a Vector for Malware Distribution
Bad actors have been
observed
hosting videos on the Russian video-sharing platform RuTube that advertise cheats for Roblox, tricking users into clicking on links that lead to Trojan and stealer malware like Salat Stealer. It’s worth noting that
similar tactics have been widespread
on YouTube. Legacy cipher retired
Microsoft Plans RC4 Deprecation
Microsoft has
announced
that it’s deprecating RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4) encryption in Kerberos to strengthen Windows authentication. By mid-2026, domain controller defaults will be updated for the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) on Windows Server 2008 and later to only allow AES-SHA1 encryption.</p>

<p>RC4 will be disabled by default and only used in scenarios where a domain administrator explicitly configures an account or the KDC to use it. “RC4, once a staple for compatibility, is susceptible to attacks like Kerberoasting that can be used to steal credentials and compromise networks,” the company said. “It is crucial to discontinue using RC4.” The decision also comes after U.S. Senator Ron Wyden
called on
the U.S.</p>

<p>Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate the company over its use of the obsolete cipher. IMSI catcher arrests
Serbia Details 2 Chinese Nationals for Smishing Attacks
Serbian police have
detained
two Chinese nationals for driving around with an improvised IMSI catcher in their car that functioned as a fake mobile base station. The pair is alleged to have sent SMS phishing messages that tricked people into visiting phishing sites that masqueraded as mobile operators, government portals, and large companies to collect payment card details. The captured card data was later abused overseas to pay for goods and services.</p>

<p>The names of the arrested individuals were not disclosed. But they are suspected to be part of an organized criminal group. Exposed AI servers risk
About 1K Exposed MCP Servers Found
New research from Bitsight has found roughly 1,000 Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers exposed on the internet with no authorization in place and leaking sensitive data. Some of them could allow management of a Kubernetes cluster and its pods, access to a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool, send WhatsApp messages, and even achieve remote code execution.</p>

<p>“While Anthropic authored the MCP specification, it’s not their job to enforce how every server handles authorization,” Bitsight
said
. “Because authorization is optional, it’s easy to skip it when moving from a demo to a real-world deployment, potentially exposing sensitive tools or data. Many MCP servers are designed for local use, but once one is exposed over HTTP, the attack surface expands dramatically.” To counter the risk, it’s essential that users do not expose MCP servers unless it’s absolutely necessary and
implement OAuth protections
for authorization. The development comes as exposure management company Intruder
revealed
that a scan of approximately 5 million single-page applications found more than 42,000 tokens exposed in their code.</p>

<p>The tokens span 334 types of secrets. Fake tax scam deploys RATs
Tax-Themed Phishing Campaign Delivers RATs
A phishing campaign impersonating the Income Tax Department of India has been found using themes related to alleged tax irregularities to create a false sense of urgency and deceive users into clicking on malicious links that deploy legitimate remote access tools like LogMeIn Resolve (formerly GoTo Resolve) that grant attackers unauthorized control over compromised systems. “The campaign delivered a two-stage malware chain consisting of a shellcode-based RAT loader packaged in a ZIP file and a rogue remote administration executable disguised as a GoTo Resolve updater,” Raven AI
said
. “Traditional Secure Email Gateway defenses failed to detect these messages because the sender authenticated correctly, the attachments were password-protected, and the content imitated real government communication.”
CBI busts SMS scam ring
India’s CBI Dismantles Phishing SMS Factory
India’s Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said it disrupted a large cyber fraud setup that was being used to send phishing messages across the country with the goal of tricking people into bogus schemes like fake digital arrests, loan scams, and investment frauds.</p>

<p>Three people have been arrested in connection with the case under
Operation Chakra V
. The investigation identified an organized cyber gang operating from the National Capital Region (NCR) and the Chandigarh area that managed to obtain around 21,000 SIM cards in violation of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) rules. “This gang was providing bulk SMS services to cyber criminals,” the CBI
said
. “It was found that even foreign cyber criminals were using this service to cheat Indian citizens.</p>

<p>These SIM cards were controlled through an online platform to send bulk messages. The messages offered fake loans, investment opportunities, and other financial benefits, with the aim of stealing personal and banking details of innocent people.” Separately, the agency also filed charges against 17 individuals, including four foreign nationals and 58 companies, in connection with an organized transnational cyber fraud network operating across multiple States in India. “The cyber criminals adopted a highly layered and technology-driven modus operandi, involving the use of Google advertisements, bulk SMS campaigns, SIM box-based messaging systems, cloud infrastructure, fintech platforms, and multiple mule bank accounts,” the CBI
said
. “Each stage of the operation—from luring victims to collection and movement of funds—was deliberately structured to conceal the identities of the actual controllers and evade detection by law enforcement agencies.”
APT phishing across Europe
Russian Hackers Phish the Baltics and the Balkans
StrikeReady Labs has
disclosed
details of a phishing campaign that has targeted Transnistria’s governing body with a credential phishing email attachment by spoofing the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic.</p>

<p>The HTML attachment shows a blurred decoy document along with a pop-up that prompts victims to enter their credentials. The entered information is transmitted to an attacker-controlled server. The campaign is believed to be active since at least 2023. Other targets likely include entities in Ukraine, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro, Spain, Lithuania, Bulgaria, and Moldova.</p>

<p>Fake CAPTCHA delivers malware
ClickFix Attacks Use Finger Tool
A new wave of ClickFix attacks has
leveraged
fake CAPTCHA checks that trick users into pasting in the Windows Run dialog, which runs the finger.exe tool to retrieve malicious PowerShell code. The attacks have been attributed to clusters tracked as KongTuke and SmartApeSG. The decades-old
finger command
is used to look up information about local and remote users on Unix and Linux systems via the Finger protocol. It was later
added
to Windows systems.</p>

<p>In another ClickFix attack
detected
by Point Wild, phony browser notifications prompt users to click “How to fix” or copy-paste a PowerShell command that leads to the deployment of DarkGate malware via a malicious HTA file. Google service abused
Phishing Attack Abuses Google Application Integration Service for Credential Theft
Threat actors are abusing Google’s Application Integration service to send phishing emails from authentic @google.com addresses and bypass SPF, DKIM, and DMARC checks. The technique, according to xorlab, is being used in the wild to target organizations with highly convincing lures mimicking new sign-in alerts for Google accounts, effectively deceiving them into clicking on suspicious links. “To evade detection, attackers use multi-hop redirect chains that bounce through multiple legitimate services,” the company
said
.</p>

<p>“Each hop uses trusted infrastructure — Google, Microsoft, AWS – making the attack difficult to detect or block at any single point. Regardless of the entry point, victims eventually land on the Microsoft 365 login page, revealing the attackers’ primary target: M365 credentials.”
AI-driven ICS scans
Reconnaissance Efforts Target Modbus Devices
Cato Networks said it observed large-scale reconnaissance and exploitation attempts targeting Modbus devices, including string monitoring boxes that directly control solar panel output. “In such cases, a threat actor with nothing more than an internet connection and a free tool could issue a simple command, ‘SWITCH OFF,’ cutting power on a bright, cloudless day,” the company
said
. “What once required time, patience, and manual skill can now be scaled and accelerated through automation.</p>

<p>With the rise of agentic AI tools, attackers can now automate reconnaissance and exploitation, reducing the time needed to execute such attacks from days to just minutes.”
Ransomware joins exploit wave
React2Shell Exploited in Ransomware Attacks
The fallout from
React2Shell
(CVE-2025-55182) has continued to spread as multiple threat actors have jumped on the exploitation bandwagon to
distribute
a
wide array of malware
. The proliferation of public exploits and stealth backdoors has been complemented by attacks of varying origins and motivations, with cybersecurity firm S-RM revealing that the vulnerability was used as an initial access vector in a Weaxor ransomware attack on December 5, 2025. “This marks a shift from previously reported exploitation,” S-RM
said
. “It indicates threat actors whose modus operandi involves cyber extortion are also successfully exploiting this vulnerability, albeit on a much smaller scale and likely in an automated fashion.” Weaxor is assessed to be a rebrand of Mallox ransomware.</p>

<p>The ransomware binary was dropped and executed on the system within less than one minute of initial access, indicating that this was likely part of an automated campaign. According to Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, more than 60 organizations have been impacted by incidents exploiting the vulnerability. Microsoft said it found “several hundred machines across a diverse set of organizations” that were compromised via React2Shell. The patterns behind these stories keep repeating — faster code, smarter lures, and fewer pauses between discovery and abuse.</p>

<p>Each case adds another piece to the wider map of how attacks adapt when attention fades. Next week will bring a fresh set of shifts, but for now, these are the signals worth noting. Stay sharp, connect the dots, and watch what changes next. That’s all for this edition of the ThreatsDay Bulletin — the pulse of what’s moving beneath the surface every Thursday.</p>

<h2 id="north-korea-linked-hackers-steal-202-billion-in-2025-leading-global-crypto-theft"><a id="article-4"></a>North Korea-Linked Hackers Steal $2.02 Billion in 2025, Leading Global Crypto Theft</h2>

<p>Threat actors with ties to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK or North Korea) have been instrumental in driving a surge in global cryptocurrency theft in 2025, accounting for at least $2.02 billion out of more than $3.4 billion stolen from January through early December. The figure represents a 51% increase year-over-year and $681 million more than 2024, when the threat actors stole $1.3 billion, according to Chainalysis’ Crypto Crime Report shared with The Hacker News. “This marks the most severe year on record for DPRK crypto theft in terms of value stolen, with DPRK attacks also accounting for a record 76% of all service compromises,” the blockchain intelligence company
said
. “Overall, 2025’s numbers bring the lower-bound cumulative estimate for cryptocurrency funds stolen by the DPRK to $6.75 billion.”
The
February compromise
of cryptocurrency exchange Bybit alone is responsible for $1.5 billion of the $2.02 billion plundered by North Korea.</p>

<p>The attack was
attributed
to a threat cluster known as
TraderTraitor
(aka Jade Sleet and Slow Pisces). An analysis
published
by Hudson Rock earlier this month linked a machine infected with Lumma Stealer to infrastructure associated with the Bybit hack based on the presence of the email address “
trevorgreer9312@gmail[.]com
.”
The cryptocurrency thefts are part of a broader series of attacks conducted by the North Korea-backed hacking group called Lazarus Group over the past decade. The adversary is also
believed
to be involved in the theft of $36 million worth of cryptocurrency from South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange,
Upbit
, last month. Lazarus Group is affiliated with Pyongyang’s Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB).</p>

<p>It’s
estimated
to have siphoned no less than $200 million from over 25 cryptocurrency heists between 2020 and 2023. The nation-state adversary is one of the most prolific hacking groups that also has a track record of
orchestrating
a long-running campaign referred to as
Operation Dream Job
, in which
prospective employees
working in defense, manufacturing, chemical, aerospace, and technology sectors are approached via LinkedIn or WhatsApp with lucrative job opportunities to trick them into downloading and running malware such as
BURNBOOK, MISTPEN
, and
BADCALL
, the last of which also comes in a
Linux version
. The end goal of these efforts is two-pronged: to collect sensitive data and generate illicit revenue for the regime in violation of international sanctions imposed on the country. A second approach adopted by North Korean threat actors is to
embed
information technology (IT) workers inside companies across the world
under false pretenses
, either in an individual capacity or through
front companies
like
DredSoftLabs
and
Metamint Studio
that are set up for this purpose.</p>

<p>This also includes gaining privileged access to crypto services and enabling high‑impact compromises. The fraudulent operation has been nicknamed Wagemole. “Part of this record year likely reflects an expanded reliance on IT worker infiltration at exchanges, custodians, and Web3 firms, which can accelerate initial access and lateral movement ahead of large‑scale theft,” Chainalysis said. Regardless of the method used, the stolen funds are routed through Chinese-language money movement and guarantee services, as well as cross-chain bridges, mixers, and specialized marketplaces like Huione to launder the proceeds.</p>

<p>What’s more, the pilfered assets follow a structured, multi-wave laundering pathway that unfolds over approximately 45 days following the hacks -
Wave 1: Immediate Layering (Days 0-5)
, which involves immediate distancing of funds from the theft source using DeFi protocols and mixing services
Wave 2: Initial Integration (Days 6-10)
, which involves shifting the funds to cryptocurrency exchanges, second-tier mixing services, and cross-chain bridges like XMRt
Wave 3: Final Integration (Days 20-45)
, which involves using services that facilitate ultimate conversion to fiat currency or other assets
“Their heavy use of professional Chinese-language money laundering services and over-the-counter (OTC) traders suggests that DPRK threat actors are tightly integrated with illicit actors across the Asia-Pacific region, and is consistent with Pyongyang’s historical use of China-based networks to gain access to the international financial system,” the company said. The disclosure comes as
Minh Phuong Ngoc Vong
, a 40-year-old Maryland man, has been sentenced to 15 months in prison for his role in the
IT worker scheme
by allowing North Korean nationals based in Shenyang, China, to use his identity to land jobs at several U.S. government agencies, per the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ).</p>

<p>Between 2021 and 2024, Vong used fraudulent misrepresentations to obtain employment with at least 13 different U.S. companies, including landing a contract at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In all, Vong was paid more than $970,000 in salary for software development services that were carried out by overseas conspirators. “Vong conspired with others, including John Doe, aka William James, a foreign national living in Shenyang, China, to defraud U.S.</p>

<p>companies into hiring Vong as a remote software developer,” the DoJ
said
. “After securing these jobs through materially false statements about his education, training, and experience, Vong allowed Doe and others to use his computer access credentials to perform the remote software development work and receive payment for that work.”
The IT worker scheme appears to be undergoing a shift in strategy, with DPRK-linked actors increasingly acting as recruiters to enlist collaborators through platforms like Upwork and Freelancer to further scale the operations. “These recruiters approach targets with a scripted pitch, requesting ‘collaborators’ to help bid on and deliver projects. They provide step-by-step instructions for account registration, identity verification, and credential sharing,” Security Alliance
said
in a report published last month.</p>

<p>“In many cases, victims ultimately surrender full access to their freelance accounts or install remote-access tools such as AnyDesk or Chrome Remote Desktop. This enables the threat actor to operate under the victim’s verified identity and IP address, allowing them to bypass platform verification controls and conduct illicit activity undetected.”

<h2 id="the-case-for-dynamic-ai-saas-security-as-copilots-scale"><a id="article-5"></a>The Case for Dynamic AI-SaaS Security as Copilots Scale</h2>

<p>Within the past year, artificial intelligence copilots and agents have quietly permeated the SaaS applications businesses use every day. Tools like Zoom, Slack, Microsoft 365, Salesforce, and ServiceNow now come with built-in AI assistants or agent-like features. Virtually every major SaaS vendor has rushed to embed AI into their offerings. The result is an explosion of AI capabilities across the SaaS stack, a phenomenon of
AI sprawl
where AI tools proliferate without centralized oversight.</p>

<p>For security teams, this represents a shift. As these AI copilots scale up in use, they are changing how data moves through SaaS. An AI agent can connect multiple apps and automate tasks across them, effectively creating new integration pathways on the fly. An AI meeting assistant might automatically pull in documents from SharePoint to summarize in an email, or a sales AI might cross-reference CRM data with financial records in real time.</p>

<p>These AI data connections form complex, dynamic pathways that traditional static app models never had. When AI Blends In - Why Traditional Governance Breaks
This shift has exposed a fundamental weakness in legacy SaaS security and governance. Traditional controls assumed stable user roles, fixed app interfaces, and human-paced changes. However, AI agents break those assumptions.</p>

<p>They operate at machine speed, traverse multiple systems, and often wield higher-than-usual privileges to perform their job. Their activity tends to blend into normal user logs and generic API traffic, making it hard to distinguish an AI’s actions from a person’s. Consider Microsoft 365 Copilot: when this AI fetches documents that a given user wouldn’t normally see, it leaves little to no trace in standard audit logs. A security admin might see an approved service account accessing files, and not realize it was Copilot pulling confidential data on someone’s behalf.</p>

<p>Similarly, if an attacker hijacks an AI agent’s token or account, they can quietly misuse it. Moreover, AI identities don’t behave like human users at all. They don’t fit neatly into existing IAM roles, and they often require very broad data access to function (far more than a single user would need). Traditional data loss prevention tools struggle because once an AI has wide read access, it can potentially aggregate and expose data in ways no simple rule would catch.</p>

<p>Permission drift is another challenge. In a static world, you might review integration access once a quarter. But AI integrations can change capabilities or accumulate access quickly, outpacing periodic reviews. Access often drifts silently when roles change or new features turn on.</p>

<p>A scope that seemed safe last week might quietly expand (e.g., an AI plugin gaining new permissions after an update) without anyone realizing. All these factors mean static SaaS security and governance tools are falling behind. If you’re only looking at static app configurations, predefined roles, and after-the-fact logs, you can’t reliably tell what an AI agent actually did, what data it accessed, which records it changed, or whether its permissions have outgrown policy in the interim. A Checklist for Securing AI Copilots and Agents
Before introducing new tools or frameworks, security teams should pressure-test their current posture.</p>

<p>Question
✓
Do we know every copilot, agent, and integration running in our SaaS environment? Do we know what each one can access right now? Can we see what each one actually did across apps? Can we spot access drift as it happens?</p>

<p>If something goes wrong, can we reconstruct what happened end to end? Can we block risky actions in real time, not just alert after? Do we know which OAuth tokens exist and what scopes they grant? Can we tell human activity from agent activity in logs?</p>

<p>If several of these questions are difficult for you to answer, it’s a signal that static SaaS security models are no longer sufficient for AI tools. Dynamic AI-SaaS Security - Guardrails for AI Apps
To address these gaps, security teams are beginning to adopt what can be described as dynamic AI-SaaS security. In contrast to static security (which treats apps as siloed and unchanging), dynamic AI-SaaS security is a policy driven, adaptive guardrail layer that operates in real-time on top of your SaaS integrations and OAuth grants. Think of it as a living security layer that understands what your copilots and agents are doing moment-to-moment, and adjusts or intervenes according to policy.</p>

<p>Dynamic AI-SaaS security monitors AI agent activity across all your SaaS apps, watching for policy violations, abnormal behavior, or signs of trouble. Rather than relying on yesterday’s checklist of permissions, it learns and adapts to how an agent is actually being used. A dynamic security platform will track an AI agent’s effective access. If the agent suddenly touches a system or dataset outside its usual scope, it can flag or block that in real-time.</p>

<p>It can also detect configuration drift or privilege creep instantly and alert teams before an incident occurs. Another hallmark of dynamic AI-SaaS security is visibility and auditability. Because the security layer mediates the AI’s actions, it keeps a detailed record of what the AI is doing across systems. Every prompt, every file accessed, and every update made by the AI can be logged in structured form.</p>

<p>This means that if something does go wrong, say an AI makes an unintended change or accesses a forbidden file, the security team can trace exactly what happened and why. Dynamic AI-SaaS security platforms leverage automation and AI themselves to keep up with the torrent of events. They learn normal patterns of agent behavior and can prioritize true anomalies or risks so that security teams aren’t drowning in alerts. They might correlate an AI’s actions across multiple apps to understand the context and flag only genuine threats.</p>

<p>This proactive stance helps catch issues that traditional tools would miss, whether it’s a subtle data leak via an AI or a malicious prompt injection causing an agent to misbehave. Conclusion - Embracing Adaptive Guardrails
As AI copilots take on a bigger role in our SaaS workflows, security teams should think about evolving their strategy in parallel. The old model of set-and-forget SaaS security, with static roles and infrequent audits, simply can’t keep up with the speed and complexity of AI activity. The case for dynamic AI-SaaS security is ultimately about maintaining control without stifling innovation.</p>

<p>With the right dynamic security platform in place, organizations can confidently adopt AI copilots and integrations, knowing they have real-time guardrails to prevent misuse, catch anomalies, and enforce policy. Dynamic AI-SaaS security platforms (like Reco) are emerging to deliver these capabilities out-of-the-box, from monitoring of AI privileges to automated incident response. They act as that missing layer on top of OAuth and app integrations, adapting on the fly to what agents are doing and ensuring nothing falls through the cracks. Figure 1: Reco’s generative AI application discovery
For security leaders watching the rise of AI copilots, SaaS security can no longer be static.</p>

<p>By embracing a dynamic model, you equip your organization with living guardrails that let you ride the AI wave safely. It’s an investment in resilience that will pay off as AI continues to transform the SaaS ecosystem. Interested in how dynamic AI-SaaS security could work for your organization? Consider exploring platforms like Reco that are built to provide this adaptive guardrail layer.</p>

<h2 id="kimsuky-spreads-docswap-android-malware-via-qr-phishing-posing-as-delivery-app"><a id="article-7"></a>Kimsuky Spreads DocSwap Android Malware via QR Phishing Posing as Delivery App</h2>

<p>The North Korean threat actor known as
Kimsuky
has been linked to a new campaign that distributes a new variant of Android malware called
DocSwap
via QR codes hosted on phishing sites mimicking Seoul-based logistics firm CJ Logistics (formerly CJ Korea Express). “The threat actor leveraged QR codes and notification pop-ups to lure victims into installing and executing the malware on their mobile devices,” ENKI
said
. “The malicious app decrypts an embedded encrypted APK and launches a malicious service that provides RAT capabilities.”
“Since Android blocks apps from unknown sources and displays security warnings by default, the threat actor claims the app is a safe, official release to trick victims into ignoring the warning and installing the malware.”
According to the South Korean cybersecurity company, some of these artifacts masquerade as package delivery service apps. It’s being assessed that the threat actors are using
smishing texts or phishing emails
impersonating delivery companies to deceive recipients into clicking on booby-trapped URLs hosting the apps.</p>

<p>A noteworthy aspect of the attack is its QR code-based mobile redirection, which prompts users visiting the URLs from a desktop computer to scan a QR code displayed on the page on their Android device to install the supposed shipment tracking app and look up the status. The QR code is engineered to redirect the user to a “tracking.php” script that implements server-side logic to check the User-Agent string of the browser and display a message urging them to install a security module under the guise of verifying their identity due to supposed “international customs security policies.”
Should the victim proceed to install the app, an APK package (“SecDelivery.apk”) is downloaded from the server (“27.102.137[.]181”). The APK file then decrypts and loads an encrypted APK embedded into its resources to launch the new version of DocSwap, but not before ascertaining that it has obtained the necessary permission to read and manage external storage, access the internet, and install additional packages. “Once it confirms all permissions, it immediately registers the MainService of the newly loaded APK as ‘com.delivery.security.MainService,’” ENKI said.</p>

<p>“Simultaneously with service registration, the base application launches AuthActivity. This activity masquerades as an OTP authentication screen and verifies the user’s identity using a delivery number.”
The shipment number is hard-coded within the APK as “742938128549,” and is likely delivered alongside the malicious URL during the initial access phase. Once the user enters the provided delivery number, the application is configured to generate a random six-digit verification code and display it as a notification, following which they are prompted to input the generated code. As soon as the code is provided, the app opens a WebView with the legitimate URL “www.cjlogistics[.]com/ko/tool/parcel/tracking,” while, in the background, the trojan connects to an attacker-controlled server (“27.102.137[.]181:50005”) and receive as many as 57 commands that allow it to log keystrokes, capture audio, start/stop camera recording perform file operations, run commands, upload/download files, and gather location, SMS messages, contacts, call logs, and a list of installed apps.</p>

<p>ENKI said it also discovered two other samples disguised as a P2B Airdrop app and a trojanized version of a legitimate VPN program called
BYCOM VPN
(“com.bycomsolutions.bycomvpn”) that’s available on the Google Play Store and developed by an Indian IT services company named Bycom Solutions. “This indicates that the threat actor injected malicious functionality into the legitimate APK and repackaged it for use in the attack,” the security company added. Further analysis of the threat actor infrastructure has uncovered phishing sites mimicking South Korean platforms like Naver and Kakao that seek to capture users’ credentials. These sites, in turn, have been found to share overlaps with a
prior Kimsuky credential harvesting campaign
targeting Naver users.</p>

<p>“The executed malware launches a RAT service, similarly to past cases but demonstrates evolved capabilities, such as using a new native function to decrypt the internal APK and incorporating diverse decoy behaviors,” ENKI said. Found this article interesting? Follow us on

<h2 id="cisa-flags-critical-asus-live-update-flaw-after-evidence-of-active-exploitation"><a id="article-8"></a>CISA Flags Critical ASUS Live Update Flaw After Evidence of Active Exploitation</h2>

<p>The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Wednesday
added
a critical flaw impacting ASUS Live Update to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (
KEV
) catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation. The vulnerability, tracked as
CVE-2025-59374
(CVSS score: 9.3), has been described as an “embedded malicious code vulnerability” introduced by means of a supply chain compromise that could allow attackers to perform unintended actions. “Certain versions of the ASUS Live Update client were distributed with unauthorized modifications introduced through a supply chain compromise,” according to a description of the flaw published in CVE.org.</p>

<p>“The modified builds could cause devices meeting specific targeting conditions to perform unintended actions. Only devices that met these conditions and installed the compromised versions were affected.”
It’s worth noting that the vulnerability refers to the
supply chain attack
that came to light in
March 2019
, when ASUS acknowledged that an advanced persistent threat (APT) group managed to breach some of its servers as part of a campaign codenamed Operation ShadowHammer by Kaspersky. The activity is said to have run between June and November 2018. The Russian cybersecurity company said the goal of the attacks was to “surgically target” an unknown pool of users whose machines were identified by their network adapters’ MAC addresses.</p>

<p>The trojanized versions of the artifacts came embedded with a hard-coded list of more than 600 unique MAC addresses. “A small number of devices have been implanted with malicious code through a sophisticated attack on our Live Update servers in an attempt to target a very small and specific user group,” ASUS
noted
at the time. The issue was fixed in version 3.6.8 of the Live Update software. The development comes a few weeks after ASUS formally
announced
that the Live Update client has reached end-of-support (EOS) as of December 4, 2025.</p>

<p>The last version is 3.6.15. As a result, CISA has urged Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies still relying on the tool to discontinue its use by January 7, 2026. “ASUS is committed to software security and consistently provides real-time updates to help protect and enhance devices,” the company
said
in a support page. “Automatic, real-time software updates are available via the ASUS Live Update application.</p>

<p>Please update the ASUS Live Update to V3.6.8 or higher version to resolve security concerns.”

<h2 id="cisco-warns-of-active-attacks-exploiting-unpatched-0-day-in-asyncos-email-security-appliances"><a id="article-9"></a>Cisco Warns of Active Attacks Exploiting Unpatched 0-Day in AsyncOS Email Security Appliances</h2>

<p>Cisco has alerted users to a maximum-severity zero-day flaw in Cisco AsyncOS software that has been actively exploited by a China-nexus advanced persistent threat (APT) actor codenamed UAT-9686 in attacks targeting Cisco Secure Email Gateway and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager. The networking equipment major said it became aware of the intrusion campaign on December 10, 2025, and that it has singled out a “limited subset of appliances” with certain ports open to the internet. It’s currently not known how many customers are affected. “This attack allows the threat actors to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the underlying operating system of an affected appliance,” Cisco
said
in an advisory.</p>

<p>“The ongoing investigation has revealed evidence of a persistence mechanism planted by the threat actors to maintain a degree of control over compromised appliances.”
The as-yet-unpatched vulnerability is being tracked as
CVE-2025-20393
, and carries a CVSS score of 10.0. It concerns a case of improper input validation that allows threat actors to execute malicious instructions with elevated privileges on the underlying operating system. All releases of Cisco AsyncOS Software are affected. However, for successful exploitation to occur, the following conditions have to be met for both physical and virtual versions of Cisco Secure Email Gateway and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager appliances -
The appliance is configured with the Spam Quarantine feature
The Spam Quarantine feature is exposed to and reachable from the internet
It’s worth noting that the Spam Quarantine feature is not enabled by default.</p>

<p>To check if it’s enabled, users are advised to follow the below steps -
Connect to the web management interface
Navigate to Network &gt; IP Interfaces &gt; [Select the Interface on which Spam Quarantine is configured] (for Secure Email Gateway) or Management Appliance &gt; Network &gt; IP Interfaces &gt; [Select the interface on which Spam Quarantine is configured] (for Secure Email and Web Manager)
If the Spam Quarantine option is checked, the feature is enabled
The
exploitation activity
observed by Cisco dates back to at least late November 2025, with UAT-9686 weaponizing the vulnerability to drop tunneling tools like
ReverseSSH
(aka AquaTunnel) and
Chisel
, as well as a log cleaning utility called AquaPurge. The use of AquaTunnel has been previously associated with Chinese hacking groups like
APT41
and
UNC5174
. Also deployed in the attacks is a lightweight Python backdoor dubbed AquaShell that’s capable of receiving encoded commands and executing them. “It listens passively for unauthenticated HTTP POST requests containing specially crafted data,” Cisco
said
.</p>

<p>“If such a request is identified, the backdoor will then attempt to parse the contents using a custom decoding routine and execute them in the system shell.”
In the absence of a patch, users are advised to restore their appliances to a secure configuration, limit access from the internet, secure the devices behind a firewall to allow traffic only from trusted hosts, separate mail and management functionality onto separate network interfaces, monitor web log traffic for any unexpected traffic, and disable HTTP for the main administrator portal. It’s also recommended to turn off any network services that are not required, use strong
end-user authentication methods
like SAML or LDAP, and change the default administrator password to a more secure variant. “In case of confirmed compromise, rebuilding the appliances is, currently, the only viable option to eradicate the threat actor’s persistence mechanism from the appliance,” the company said. The development has prompted the U.S.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to
add
CVE-2025-20393 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (
KEV
) catalog, requiring Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to apply the necessary mitigations by December 24, 2025, to secure their networks. The disclosure comes as GreyNoise said it has detected a “coordinated, automated credential-based campaign” aimed at enterprise VPN authentication infrastructure, specifically probing exposed or weakly protected Cisco SSL VPN and Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect portals. More than 10,000 unique IPs are estimated to have engaged in automated login attempts to GlobalProtect portals located in the U.S., Pakistan, and Mexico using common username and password combinations on December 11, 2025. A similar spike in opportunistic brute-force login attempts has been recorded against Cisco SSL VPN endpoints as of December 12, 2025.</p>

<p>The activity originated from 1,273 IP addresses. “The activity reflects large-scale scripted login attempts, not vulnerability exploitation,” the threat intelligence firm
said
. “Consistent infrastructure usage and timing indicate a single campaign pivoting across multiple VPN platforms.”

<p>SonicWall has rolled out fixes to
address
a security flaw in Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 100 series appliances that it said has been actively exploited in the wild. The vulnerability, tracked as
CVE-2025-40602
(CVSS score: 6.6), concerns a case of local privilege escalation that arises as a result of insufficient authorization in the appliance management console (AMC). It affects the following versions -
12.4.3-03093 (platform-hotfix) and earlier versions - Fixed in 12.4.3-03245 (platform-hotfix)
12.5.0-02002 (platform-hotfix) and earlier versions - Fixed in 12.5.0-02283 (platform-hotfix)
“This vulnerability was reported to be leveraged in combination with
CVE-2025-23006
(CVSS score 9.8) to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution with root privileges,” SonicWall said. It’s worth noting that CVE-2025-23006 was patched by the company in late January 2025 in version 12.4.3-02854 (platform-hotfix).</p>

<p>Clément Lecigne and Zander Work of Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) have been credited with discovering and reporting CVE-2025-40602. There are currently no details on the scale of the attacks and who is behind the efforts. Back in July, Google
said
it’s tracking a cluster named UNC6148 that’s targeting fully-patched end-of-life SonicWall SMA 100 series devices as part of a campaign designed to drop a backdoor called OVERSTEP. It’s currently not clear if these activities are related.</p>

<p>In light of active exploitation, it’s essential that SonicWall SMA 100 series users apply the fixes as soon as possible. Update

<h2 id="kimwolf-botnet-hijacks-18-million-android-tvs-launches-large-scale-ddos-attacks"><a id="article-11"></a>Kimwolf Botnet Hijacks 1.8 Million Android TVs, Launches Large-Scale DDoS Attacks</h2>

<p>A new distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnet known as
Kimwolf
has enlisted a massive army of no less than 1.8 million infected devices comprising Android-based TVs, set-top boxes, and tablets, and may be associated with another botnet known as
AISURU
, according to findings from QiAnXin XLab. “Kimwolf is a botnet compiled using the
NDK
[Native Development Kit],” the company
said
in a report published today. “In addition to typical DDoS attack capabilities, it integrates proxy forwarding, reverse shell, and file management functions.”
The hyper-scale botnet is estimated to have issued 1.7 billion DDoS attack commands within a three-day period between November 19 and 22, 2025, around the same time one of its command-and-control (C2) domains – 14emeliaterracewestroxburyma02132[.]su –
came first
in Cloudflare’s list of top 100 domains, briefly even surpassing Google. Kimwolf’s primary infection targets are TV boxes deployed in residential network environments.</p>

<p>Some of the affected device models include TV BOX, SuperBOX, HiDPTAndroid, P200, X96Q, XBOX, SmartTV, and MX10. Infections are scattered globally, with Brazil, India, the U.S., Argentina, South Africa, and the Philippines registering higher concentrations. That said, the exact means by which the malware is propagated to these devices is presently unclear. XLab said its investigation into the botnet commenced after it received a “version 4” artifact of Kimwolf from a trusted community partner on October 24, 2025.</p>

<p>Since then, an additional eight samples have been discovered as of last month. “We observed that Kimwolf’s C2 domains have been successfully taken down by unknown parties at least three times [in December], forcing it to upgrade its tactics and turn to using ENS (Ethereum Name Service) to harden its infrastructure, demonstrating its powerful evolutionary capability,” XLab researchers said. That’s not all. Earlier this month, XLab managed to successfully seize control of one of the C2 domains, enabling it to assess the scale of the botnet and observing a peak daily active bot IP count of approximately 1.83 million.</p>

<p>An interesting aspect of Kimwolf is that it’s tied to the infamous AISURU botnet, which has been behind some of the record-breaking DDoS attacks over the past year. It’s suspected that the attackers reused code from AISURU in the early stages, before opting to develop the Kimwolf botnet to evade detection. XLab said it’s possible some of these attacks may not have come from AISURU alone, and that Kimwolf may be either participating or even leading the efforts. “These two major botnets propagated through the same infection scripts between September and November, coexisting in the same batch of devices,” the company said.</p>

<p>“They actually belong to the same hacker group.”
This assessment is based on
similarities
in APK packages uploaded to the VirusTotal platform, in
some cases
even using the
same code signing certificate
(“John Dinglebert Dinglenut VIII VanSack Smith”). Further definitive evidence arrived on December 8, 2025, with the discovery of an active downloader server (“93.95.112[.]59”) that contained a script referencing APKs for both Kimwolf and AISURU. The malware in itself is fairly straightforward. Once launched, it ensures that only one instance of the process runs on the infected device, and then proceeds to decrypt the embedded C2 domain, uses DNS-over-TLS to obtain the C2 IP address, and connects to it in order to receive and execute commands.</p>

<p>Recent versions of the botnet malware detected as recently as December 12, 2025, have introduced a technique known as
EtherHiding
that makes use of an ENS domain (“pawsatyou[.]eth”) to fetch the actual C2 IP from the associated smart contract (
0xde569B825877c47fE637913eCE5216C644dE081F
) in an effort to render its infrastructure more resilient to takedown efforts. Specifically, this involves extracting an IPv6 address from the
“lol” field of the transaction
, then taking the last four bytes of the address and performing an XOR operation with the key “0x93141715” to get the actual IP address. Besides encrypting sensitive data related to C2 servers and DNS resolvers, Kimwolf uses TLS encryption for network communications to receive DDoS commands. In all, the malware supports 13 DDoS attack methods over UDP, TCP, and ICMP.</p>

<p>The attack targets, per XLab, are located in the U.S., China, France, Germany, and Canada. Further analysis has determined that over 96% of the commands relate to using the bot nodes for providing proxy services. This indicates the attackers’ attempts to exploit the bandwidth from compromised devices and maximize profit. As part of the effort, a Rust-based Command Client module is deployed to form a proxy network.</p>

<p>Also delivered to the nodes is a ByteConnect software development kit (SDK), a monetization solution that allows app developers and IoT device owners to monetize their traffic. “Giant botnets originated with Mirai in 2016, with infection targets mainly concentrated on IoT devices like home broadband routers and cameras,” XLab said. “However, in recent years, information on multiple million-level giant botnets like Badbox, Bigpanzi, Vo1d, and Kimwolf has been disclosed, indicating that some attackers have started to turn their attention to various smart TVs and TV boxes.”

<h2 id="apt28-targets-ukrainian-ukr-net-users-in-long-running-credential-phishing-campaign"><a id="article-12"></a>APT28 Targets Ukrainian UKR-net Users in Long-Running Credential Phishing Campaign</h2>

<p>The Russian state-sponsored threat actor known as
APT28
has been attributed to what has been described as a “sustained” credential-harvesting campaign targeting users of UKR[.]net, a webmail and news service popular in Ukraine. The activity, observed by Recorded Future’s Insikt Group between June 2024 and April 2025, builds upon
prior findings
from the cybersecurity company in May 2024 that detailed the hacking group’s attacks targeting European networks with the HeadLace malware and credential-harvesting web pages. APT28 is also tracked as BlueDelta, Fancy Bear, Forest Blizzard, FROZENLAKE, Iron Twilight, ITG05, Pawn Storm, Sednit, Sofacy, and TA422. It’s assessed to be affiliated with Russia’s Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Federation’s Armed Forces (GRU).</p>

<p>The latest attacks are characterized by the deployment of UKR[.]net-themed login pages on legitimate services like Mocky to entice recipients into entering their credentials and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes. Links to these pages are embedded within PDF documents that are distributed via phishing emails. The links are shortened using services like tiny[.]cc or tinyurl[.]com. In some cases, the threat actor has also been observed using subdomains created on platforms like Blogger (*.blogspot[.]com) to launch a two-tier redirection chain that leads to the credential harvesting page.</p>

<p>The efforts are part of a broader set of phishing and credential theft operations orchestrated by the adversary since mid-2000s targeting government institutions, defense contractors, weapons suppliers, logistics firms, and policy think tanks in pursuit of Russia’s strategic objectives. “While this campaign does not reveal specific targets, BlueDelta’s historical focus on credential theft to enable intelligence collection provides strong indicators of likely intent to collect sensitive information from Ukrainian users in support of broader GRU intelligence requirements,” the Mastercard-owned company said in a report shared with The Hacker News. What has changed is the transition from using compromised routers to proxy tunneling services such as ngrok and Serveo to capture and relay the stolen credentials and 2FA codes. “BlueDelta’s continued abuse of free hosting and anonymized tunneling infrastructure likely reflects an adaptive response to
Western-led infrastructure takedowns
in early 2024,” Recorded Future said.</p>

<p>“The campaign highlights the GRU’s persistent interest in compromising Ukrainian user credentials to support intelligence-gathering operations amid Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine.”

<h2 id="new-forumtroll-phishing-attacks-target-russian-scholars-using-fake-elibrary-emails"><a id="article-13"></a>New ForumTroll Phishing Attacks Target Russian Scholars Using Fake eLibrary Emails</h2>

<p>The threat actor linked to
Operation ForumTroll
has been attributed to a fresh set of phishing attacks targeting individuals within Russia, according to Kaspersky. The Russian cybersecurity vendor said it detected the new activity in October 2025. The origins of the threat actor are presently unknown. “While the spring cyberattacks focused on organizations, the fall campaign honed in on specific individuals: scholars in the field of political science, international relations, and global economics, working at major Russian universities and research institutions,” security researcher Georgy Kucherin
said
.</p>

<p>Operation ForumTroll
refers
to a series of sophisticated phishing attacks exploiting a then-zero-day vulnerability in Google Chrome (CVE-2025-2783) to deliver the LeetAgent backdoor and a spyware implant known as Dante. The latest attack wave also commences with emails that claimed to be from eLibrary, a Russian scientific electronic library, with the messages sent from the address “support@e-library[.]wiki.” The domain was registered in March 2025, six months before the start of the campaign, suggesting that preparations for the attack had been underway for some time. Kaspersky said the
strategic domain aging
was done to avoid raising any red flags typically associated with sending emails from a freshly registered domain. In addition, the attackers also hosted a copy of the legitimate eLibrary homepage (“elibrary[.]ru”) on the bogus domain to maintain the ruse.</p>

<p>The emails instruct prospective targets to click on an embedded link pointing to the malicious site to download a plagiarism report. Should a victim follow through, a ZIP archive with the naming pattern “<LastName>_<FirstName>_<Patronymic>.zip" is downloaded to their machine. What's more, these links are designed for one-time use, meaning any subsequent attempts to navigate to the URL cause it to display a Russian language message stating "Download failed, please try again later." In the event, the download is attempted from a platform other than Windows, the user is prompted to "try again later on a Windows computer."
"The attackers also carefully personalized the phishing emails for their targets, specific professionals in the field," the company said. "The downloaded archive was named with the victim's last name, first name, and patronymic."
The archive contains a Windows shortcut (LNK) with the same name, which, when executed, runs a PowerShell script to download and launch a PowerShell-based payload from a remote server.</Patronymic></FirstName></LastName></p>

<p>The payload then contacts a URL to fetch a final-stage DLL and persist it using COM hijacking. It also downloads and displays a decoy PDF to the victim. The final payload is a command-and-control (C2) and red teaming framework known as
Tuoni
, enabling the threat actors to gain remote access to the victim’s Windows device. “ForumTroll has been targeting organizations and individuals in Russia and Belarus since at least 2022,” Kaspersky said.</p>

<p>“Given this lengthy timeline, it is likely this APT group will continue to target entities and individuals of interest within these two countries.”
The disclosure comes as Positive Technologies
detailed
the activities of two threat clusters,
QuietCrabs
– a suspected Chinese hacking group also tracked as UTA0178 and UNC5221 – and
Thor
, which appears to be involved in ransomware attacks since May 2025. These intrusion sets have been found to leverage security flaws in Microsoft SharePoint (
CVE-2025-53770
), Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (
CVE-2025-4427 and CVE-2025-4428
), Ivanti Connect Secure (
CVE-2024-21887
), and Ivanti Sentry (
CVE-2023-38035
). Attacks carried out by QuietCrabs take advantage of the initial access to deploy an ASPX web shell and use it to deliver a JSP loader that’s capable of downloading and executing
KrustyLoader
, which then drops the
Sliver
implant. “Thor is a threat group first observed in attacks against Russian companies in 2025,” researchers Alexander Badayev, Klimentiy Galkin, and Vladislav Lunin said.</p>

<p>“As final payloads, the attackers use LockBit and Babuk ransomware, as well as Tactical RMM and MeshAgent to maintain persistence.”

<h2 id="fix-soc-blind-spots-see-threats-to-your-industry--country-in-real-time"><a id="article-14"></a>Fix SOC Blind Spots: See Threats to Your Industry &amp; Country in Real Time</h2>

<p>Modern security teams often feel like they’re driving through fog with failing headlights. Threats accelerate, alerts multiply, and SOCs struggle to understand which dangers matter right now for their business. Breaking out of reactive defense is no longer optional. It’s the difference between preventing incidents and cleaning up after them.</p>

<p>Below is the path from reactive firefighting to a proactive, context-rich SOC that actually sees what’s coming. When the SOC Only Sees in the Rear-View Mirror
Many SOCs still rely on a backward-facing workflow. Analysts wait for an alert, investigate it, escalate, and eventually respond. This pattern is understandable: the job is noisy, the tooling is complex, and alert fatigue bends even the toughest teams into reactive mode.</p>

<p>But a reactive posture hides several structural problems:
No visibility into what threat actors are preparing. Limited ability to anticipate campaigns targeting the organization’s sector. Inability to adjust defenses before an attack hits. Overreliance on signatures that reflect yesterday’s activity.</p>

<p>The result is a SOC that constantly catches up but rarely gets ahead. The Cost of Waiting for the Alarm to Ring
Reactive SOCs pay in time, money, and risk. Longer investigations
. Analysts must research every suspicious object from scratch because they lack a broader context.</p>

<p>Wasted resources
. Without visibility into which threats are relevant to their vertical and geography, teams chase false positives instead of focusing on real dangers. Higher breach likelihood
. Threat actors often reuse infrastructure and target specific industries.</p>

<p>Seeing these patterns late gives attackers the advantage. A proactive SOC flips this script by reducing uncertainty. It knows which threats are circulating in its environment, what campaigns are active, and which alerts deserve immediate escalation. Threat Intelligence: The Engine of Proactive Security
Threat intelligence fills the gaps left by reactive operations.</p>

<p>It provides a stream of evidence about what attackers are doing right now and how their tools evolve. ANY.RUN’s
Threat Intelligence Lookup
serves as a tactical magnifying glass for SOCs. It converts raw threat data into an operational asset. TI Lookup: investigate threats and indicators, click search bar to select parameters
Analysts can quickly:
Enrich
alerts with behavioral and infrastructure data;
Identify
malware families and campaigns with precision;
Understand
how a sample acts when detonated in a sandbox;
Investigate
artifacts, DNS, IPs, hashes, and relations in seconds.</p>

<p>For organizations that aim to build a more proactive stance, TI Lookup works as the starting point for faster triage, higher-confidence decisions, and a clearer understanding of threat relevance. Turn intelligence into action, cut investigation time with instant threat context. Contact ANY.RUN to integrate TI Lookup
ANY.RUN’s
TI Feeds
complement SOC workflows by supplying continuously updated indicators gathered from real malware executions. This ensures defenses adapt at the speed of threat evolution.</p>

<p>Focus on Threats that Actually Matter to Your Business
But context alone isn’t enough; teams need to interpret this intelligence for their specific business environment. Threats are not evenly distributed across the world. Each sector and region has its own constellation of malware families, campaigns, and criminal groups. Companies from what industries and countries encounter Tycoon 2FA most often recently
Threat Intelligence Lookup supports industry and geographic attribution of threats and indicators thus helping SOCs answer vital questions:
Is this alert relevant to our company’s sector?</p>

<p>Is this malware known to target companies in our country? Are we seeing the early movements of a campaign aimed at organizations like ours? By mapping activity to both industry verticals and geographies, SOCs gain an immediate understanding of where a threat sits in their risk landscape. This reduces noise, speeds up triage, and lets teams focus on threats that truly demand action.</p>

<p>Focus your SOC on what truly matters. See which threats target your sector today
with TI Lookup
. Here is an example: a suspicious domain turns out to be linked to Lumma Stealer and ClickFix attacks targeting mostly telecom and hospitality businesses in the USA and Canada:
domainName:”benelui.click”
Industries and countries most targeted by threats the IOC is linked to
Or suppose a CISO in German manufacturing company wants a baseline for sector risks:
industry:”Manufacturing” and submissionCountry:”DE”
TI Lookup summary on malware samples analyzed by German users and targeting manufacturing business
This query surfaces top threats like Tycoon 2FA and EvilProxy plus highlights the interest of Storm-1747 APT group that operates Tycoon 2FA to the country’s production sector. This becomes an immediate priority list for detection engineering, threat hunting hypotheses, and security awareness training.</p>

<p>Analysts access sandbox sessions and real-world IOCs related to those threats. IOCs and TTPs instantly provided by TI Lookup fuel detection rules for the most relevant threats thus allowing to detect and mitigate incidents proactively, protecting businesses and their customers.

Why the Threat Landscape Demands Better Visibility
Attackers’ infrastructure is changing fast and it’s no longer limited to one threat per campaign. We’re now seeing the emergence of hybrid threats, where multiple malware families are combined within a single operation.</p>

<p>These blended attacks merge logic from different infrastructures, redirection layers, and credential-theft modules, making detection, tracking, and attribution significantly harder. Hybrid attack with Salty and Tycoon detected inside ANY.RUN sandbox in just 35 seconds
Recent investigations uncovered
Tycoon 2FA and Salty
working side by side in the same chain. One kit runs the initial lure and reverse proxy, while another takes over for session hijacking or credential capture. For many SOC teams, this combination breaks the existing defense strategies and detection rules, allowing attackers to slip past the security layer.</p>

<p>Tracking these changes across the broader threat landscape has become critical. Analysts must monitor behavior patterns and attack logic in real time, not just catalog kit variants. The faster teams can see these links forming, the faster they can respond to phishing campaigns built for adaptability. Conclusion: A Clearer Horizon for Modern SOCs
Businesses can’t afford SOC blind spots anymore.</p>

<p>Attackers specialize, campaigns localize, and malware evolves faster than signatures can keep up. Proactive defense requires context, clarity, and speed. Threat Intelligence Lookup strengthened with industry and geo context and supported by fresh indicators from TI Feeds gives SOC leaders exactly that. Instead of reacting to alerts in the dark, decision makers gain a forward-looking view of the threats that really matter to their business.</p>
