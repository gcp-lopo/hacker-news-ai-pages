<h2 id="linux-malware-delivered-via-malicious-rar-filenames-evades-antivirus-detection"><a id="article-1"></a>Linux Malware Delivered via Malicious RAR Filenames Evades Antivirus Detection</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have shed light on a novel attack chain that employs phishing emails to deliver an open-source backdoor called
VShell
. The “Linux-specific malware infection chain that starts with a spam email with a malicious RAR archive file,” Trellix researcher Sagar Bade
said
in a technical write-up. “The payload isn’t hidden inside the file content or a macro, it’s encoded directly in the filename itself. Through clever use of shell command injection and Base64-encoded Bash payloads, the attacker turns a simple file listing operation into an automatic malware execution trigger.”
The technique, the cybersecurity company added, takes advantage of a simple yet dangerous pattern commonly observed in shell scripts that arises when file names are evaluated with inadequate sanitization, thereby causing a trivial command like eval or echo to facilitate the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>What’s more, the technique offers the added advantage of getting around traditional defenses, as antivirus engines don’t typically scan file names. The starting point of the attack is an email message containing a RAR archive, which includes a file with a maliciously crafted file name: “ziliao2.pdf<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{echo,&lt;Base64-encoded command&gt;}|{base64,-d}|bash</code>”
Specifically, the file name incorporates Bash-compatible code that’s engineered to execute commands when it’s interpreted by the shell. It’s worth noting that simply extracting the file from the archive does not trigger execution. Rather, it occurs only when a shell script or command attempts to parse the file name.</p>

<p>Another important aspect to consider here is that it’s not possible to manually create a file name with this syntax, meaning it was likely created using another language or dropped using an external tool or script that bypasses shell input validation, Trellix said. This, in turn, leads to the execution of an embedded Base64-encoded downloader, which then retrieves from an external server an ELF binary for the appropriate system architecture (x86_64, i386, i686, armv7l, or aarch64). The binary, for its part, initiates communication with a command-and-control (C2) server to obtain the encrypted VShell payload, decode, and execute it on the host. Trellix said the phishing emails are disguised as an invitation for a beauty product survey, luring recipients with a monetary reward (10 RMB) for completing it.</p>

<p>“Crucially, the email includes a RAR archive attachment (‘yy.rar’), even though it doesn’t explicitly instruct the user to open or extract it,” Bade explained. “The social engineering angle is subtle: The user is distracted by the survey content, and the presence of the attachment might be mistaken for a survey-related document or data file.”
VShell is a Go-based remote access tool that has been widely put to use by Chinese hacking groups in recent years, including
UNC5174
, supporting reverse shell, file operations, process management, port forwarding, and encrypted C2 communications. What makes this attack dangerous is that the malware operates entirely in-memory, avoiding disk-based detection, not to mention it can target a wide range of Linux devices. “This analysis highlights a dangerous evolution in Linux malware delivery where a simple file name embedded in a RAR archive can be weaponized to execute arbitrary commands,” Trellix said.</p>

<p>“The infection chain exploits command injection in shell loops, abuses Linux’s permissive execution environment, and ultimately delivers a powerful backdoor VShell malware capable of full remote control over the system.”
The development comes as Picus Security released a technical analysis of a Linux-focused post-exploit tool dubbed RingReaper that leverages the Linux kernel’s
io_uring framework
to circumvent traditional monitoring tools. It’s currently not known who is behind the malware. “Instead of invoking standard functions such as read, write, recv, send, or connect, RingReaper employs io_uringprimitives (e.g., io_uring_prep_*) to execute equivalent operations asynchronously,” security researcher Sıla Özeren Hacıoğlu
said
. “This method helps bypass hook-based detection mechanisms and reduces the visibility of malicious activity in telemetry commonly gathered by EDR platforms.”
RingReaper makes use of
io_uring
to enumerate system processes, active pseudo-terminal (PTS) sessions, network connections, and logged-in users, while reducing its footprint and avoiding detection.</p>

<p>It’s also capable of collecting user information from the “/etc/passwd” file, abusing SUID binaries for privilege escalation, and erasing traces of itself after execution. “It exploits the Linux kernel’s modern asynchronous I/O interface, io_uring, to minimize reliance on conventional system calls that security tools frequently monitor or hook,” Picus said.

<h2 id="chinese-hackers-murky-genesis-and-glacial-panda-escalate-cloud-and-telecom-espionage"><a id="article-2"></a>Chinese Hackers Murky, Genesis, and Glacial Panda Escalate Cloud and Telecom Espionage</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers are calling attention to malicious activity orchestrated by a China-nexus cyber espionage group known as
Murky Panda
that involves abusing trusted relationships in the cloud to breach enterprise networks. “The adversary has also shown considerable ability to quickly weaponize N-day and zero-day vulnerabilities and frequently achieves initial access to their targets by exploiting internet-facing appliances,” CrowdStrike
said
in a Thursday report. Murky Panda, also known as
Silk Typhoon
(formerly Hafnium), is best known for its
zero-day exploitation of Microsoft Exchange Server flaws
in 2021. Attacks mounted by the hacking group have targeted government, technology, academic, legal, and professional services entities in North America.</p>

<p>Earlier this March, Microsoft
detailed
the threat actor’s shift in tactics, detailing its targeting of the information technology (IT) supply chain as a means to obtain initial access to corporate networks. It’s assessed that Murky Panda’s operations are driven by intelligence gathering. Like other Chinese hacking groups, Murky Panda has exploited internet-facing appliances to obtain initial access and is believed to have also compromised small office/home office (SOHO) devices that are geolocated in the targeted country as an exit node to hinder detection efforts. Other infection pathways include exploitation of known security flaws in Citrix NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway (
CVE-2023-3519
) and Commvault (
CVE-2025-3928
).</p>

<p>The initial access is leveraged to deploy web shells like
neo-reGeorg
to establish persistence and ultimately drop a custom malware called CloudedHope. A 64-bit ELF binary and written in Golang, CloudedHope functions as a basic remote access tool (RAT) while employing anti-analysis and operational security (OPSEC) measures, such as modifying timestamps and deleting indicators of their presence in victim environments to fly under the radar. But a notable aspect of Murky Panda’s tradecraft concerns the abuse of trusted relationships between partner organizations and their cloud tenants, exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities to breach software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers’ cloud environments and conduct lateral movement to downstream victims. In at least one instance observed in late 2024, the threat actor is said to have compromised a supplier of a North American entity and used the supplier’s administrative access to the victim entity’s Entra ID tenant to add a temporary backdoor Entra ID account.</p>

<p>“Using this account, the threat actor then backdoored several preexisting Entra ID service principles related to Active Directory management and emails,” CrowdStrike said. “The adversary’s goals appear targeted in nature based on their focus on accessing emails.”
From Murky to Genesis
Another China-linked threat actor that has proven skilful at manipulating cloud services is
Genesis Panda
, which has been observed using the infrastructure for basic exfiltration and targeting cloud service provider (CSP) accounts to expand access and establish fallback persistent mechanisms. Active since at least January 2024, Genesis Panda has been attributed to high-volume operations targeting the financial services, media, telecommunications, and technology sectors spanning 11 countries. The goal of the attacks is to enable access for future intelligence-collection activity.</p>

<p>The possibility that it acts as an initial access broker stems from the group’s exploitation of a wide range of web-facing vulnerabilities and limited data exfiltration. “Although Genesis Panda targets a variety of systems, they show consistent interest in compromising cloud-hosted systems to leverage the cloud control plane for lateral movement, persistence, and enumeration,” CrowdStrike
said
. The adversary has observed “consistently” querying the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) associated with a cloud-hosted server to obtain credentials for the cloud control plane and enumerate network and general instance configurations. It’s also known to use credentials, likely obtained from compromised virtual machines (VMs), to burrow deeper into the target’s cloud account.</p>

<p>The findings illustrate how Chinese hacking groups are becoming increasingly adept at breaking and navigating cloud environments, while also prioritizing stealth and persistence to ensure sustained access and covert data harvesting. Glacial Panda Strikes Telecom Sector
The
telecommunications sector
, per CrowdStrike, has witnessed a 130% increase in
nation-state activity
over the
past year
, primarily driven by the fact they are a treasure trove of intelligence. The latest threat actor to train its sights on the industry vertical is a Chinese threat actor dubbed
Glacial Panda
. The geographic footprint of the hacking group spans Afghanistan, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Panama, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United States.</p>

<p>“Glacial Panda highly likely conducts targeted intrusions for intelligence collection purposes, accessing and exfiltrating call detail records and related communications telemetry from multiple telecommunications organizations,” the cybersecurity company said. “The adversary primarily targets Linux systems typical in the telecommunications industry, including legacy operating system distributions that support older telecommunications technologies.”
Attack chains implemented by the threat actor make use of known security vulnerabilities or weak passwords aimed at internet-facing and unmanaged servers, with follow-on activities leveraging privilege escalation bugs like
CVE-2016-5195
(aka Dirty COW) and
CVE-2021-4034
(aka PwnKit). Besides relying on living-off-the-land (LotL) techniques, Glacial Panda’s intrusions pave the way for the deployment of trojanized OpenSSH components, collectively codenamed ShieldSlide, to gather user authentication sessions and credentials. “The ShieldSlide-trojanized SSH server binary also provides backdoor access, authenticating any account (including root) when a hardcoded password is entered,” CrowdStrike said.</p>

<h2 id="automation-is-redefining-pentest-delivery"><a id="article-3"></a>Automation Is Redefining Pentest Delivery</h2>

<p>Pentesting remains one of the most effective ways to identify real-world security weaknesses before adversaries do. But as the threat landscape has evolved, the way we deliver pentest results hasn’t kept pace. Most organizations still rely on traditional reporting methods—static PDFs, emailed documents, and spreadsheet-based tracking. The problem?</p>

<p>These outdated workflows introduce delays, create inefficiencies, and undermine the value of the work. Security teams need faster insights, tighter handoffs, and clearer paths to remediation. That’s where automated delivery comes in. Platforms like
PlexTrac
automate pentest finding delivery in real time through robust, rules-based workflows.</p>

<p>(No waiting for the final report!)
The Static Delivery Problem in a Dynamic World
Delivering a pentest report solely as a static document might have made sense a decade ago, but today it’s a bottleneck. Findings are buried in long documents that don’t align with how teams operate day-to-day. After receiving the report, stakeholders must manually extract findings, create tickets in platforms like Jira or ServiceNow, and coordinate remediation tracking through disconnected workflows. By the time remediation begins, days or weeks may have passed since the issues were discovered.</p>

<p>Why Automation Matters Now
As organizations adopt Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) and expand the frequency of offensive testing, the volume of findings rapidly grows. Without automation, teams struggle to keep up. Automating delivery helps cut through the noise and deliver results in real time for faster handoffs and visibility across the entire vulnerability lifecycle. Benefits of automating pentest delivery include:
Real-time actionability:
Act on findings immediately, not after the report is finalized
Faster response:
Accelerate remediation, retesting and validation
Standardized operations:
Ensure every finding follows a consistent process
Less manual work:
Free teams to focus on strategic initiatives
Improved focus:
Keep teams focused on what matters
Service providers gain a competitive advantage by automating delivery and integrating directly into client workflows, making themselves an indispensable partner to drive client value.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>For enterprises, it’s a fast track to operational maturity and a measurable reduction in mean time to remediation (MTTR). 5 Key Components of Automated Pentest Delivery</dt>
  <dt>Centralized data ingestion</dt>
  <dd>Start by consolidating all findings—manual and automated—into a single source of truth. This includes outputs from scanners (like Tenable, Qualys, Wiz, Snyk) as well as manual pentest findings. Without centralization, vulnerability management becomes a patchwork of disconnected tools and manual processes.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Automated real-time delivery:
As findings are identified, they should be automatically routed to the right people and workflows without waiting for the full report. Predefined rulesets should trigger triage, ticketing, and tracking to allow remediation to begin while testing is still in progress. Automated routing &amp; ticketing:
Standardize routing by defining rules based on severity, asset ownership, and exploitability. Automation can assign findings, generate tickets in tools like Jira or ServiceNow, notify stakeholders through Slack or email, and close out informational issues to ensure findings are automatically routed to the right teams and systems.</p>

<p>Standardized remediation workflows:
Every finding from your centralized data should follow the same lifecycle from triage to closure based on the criteria you’ve set, regardless of source. Whether it’s discovered from a scanner or manual testing, the process from triage to fix should be consistent and traceable. Triggered retesting &amp; validation:
When a finding is marked as resolved, automation should trigger the appropriate retesting or validation workflow. This ensures nothing slips through the cracks and keeps communication between security and IT teams coordinated and closed-loop.</p>

<p>PlexTrac supports each of these capabilities through its Workflow Automation Engine, helping teams unify and accelerate delivery, remediation, and closure in one platform. Avoid Common Pitfalls
Automation is about more than just speed. It’s about building standardized, scalable systems. However, if not implemented thoughtfully, it can create new problems.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Watch out for:</dt>
  <dt>Overcomplicating early efforts</dt>
  <dd>Trying to automate everything at once can stall momentum. Start small and focus on a few repeatable workflows first. Add complexity over time and expand as you validate success. Treating automation as a one-time setup</dd>
  <dd>Your workflows should evolve alongside your tools, team structure, and priorities.</dd>
  <dt>Failing to iterate leads to stale processes that no longer align with how teams operate. Automating without clearly defined workflows:</dt>
  <dt>Jumping into automation without first mapping out your current workflows often leads to chaos. Without clear rules for routing, ownership, and escalation, automation may create more problems than it solves. How to get started</dt>
  <dt>Here’s how to begin automating pentest delivery:</dt>
  <dt>Map your current workflow</dt>
  <dd>Document how findings are delivered, triaged, assigned, and tracked today.</dd>
  <dt>Identify friction points</dt>
  <dd>Look for repetitive tasks, handoff delays, and areas where communication breaks down. Start small
:
Automate one or two high-impact steps first
, like ticket creation, email alerts, or finding delivery. Add complexity over time as you validate what’s working well and use early results to evolve workflows, add rules, and further streamline. Choose the right platform</dd>
  <dd>Look for solutions that integrate with your existing tools and provide visibility across the vulnerability lifecycle.</dd>
  <dt>Measure impact</dt>
  <dd>Track metrics like MTTR, handoff delays, and retest completion to show the value of your efforts. The Future of Pentest Delivery
Security teams are shifting from reactive testing to proactive exposure management. Pentest delivery automation is a key part of that evolution to help teams move faster, collaborate better, and reduce risk more effectively. For Service Providers, this is a chance to differentiate services, scale operations, and deliver more value with less overhead.</dd>
</dl>

<p>For Enterprise teams, it means driving maturity, demonstrating progress, and staying ahead of emerging threats. Conclusion
Pentesting is too important to be stuck in static reports and manual workflows. By automating delivery, routing, and remediation tracking, organizations can unlock the full value of their offensive security efforts by making findings more actionable, standardizing remediation workflows, and delivering measurable outcomes. Whether you’re delivering tests to clients or to an internal team, the message is clear: The future of pentest delivery is automated.</p>

<h2 id="interpol-arrests-1209-cybercriminals-across-18-african-nations-in-global-crackdown"><a id="article-4"></a>INTERPOL Arrests 1,209 Cybercriminals Across 18 African Nations in Global Crackdown</h2>

<p>INTERPOL on Friday announced that authorities from 18 countries across Africa have arrested 1,209 cybercriminals who targeted 88,000 victims. “The crackdown recovered $97.4 million and dismantled 11,432 malicious infrastructures, underscoring the global reach of cybercrime and the urgent need for cross-border cooperation,” the agency
said
. The effort is the second phase of an ongoing law enforcement initiative called
Operation Serengeti
, which took place between June and August 2025 to tackle severe crimes like ransomware, online scams. and business email compromise (BEC).</p>

<p>The first wave of arrests occurred late last year. Among the highlights are the dismantling of 25 cryptocurrency mining centres in Angola, where 60 Chinese nationals were involved in the illicit money-making scheme. “The crackdown identified 45 illicit power stations which were confiscated, along with mining and IT equipment worth more than $37 million, now earmarked by the government to support power distribution in vulnerable areas,” INTERPOL said. Elsewhere, Zambian authorities have taken down a large-scale online investment fraud operation that claimed 65,000 victims who lost around $300 million after they were lured into investing in cryptocurrency through advertising campaigns that promised high-yield returns.</p>

<p>Fifteen individuals have been arrested in connection with the scheme, with officials seizing domains, mobile numbers, and bank accounts for further investigation. Also disrupted in the southern African country is a scam center and a suspected human trafficking network. Lastly, law enforcement also tore down a transnational inheritance scam originating in Germany, arresting the primary suspect and confiscating electronics, jewellery, cash, and vehicles. The scam is estimated to have caused losses of around $1.6 million.</p>

<p>“Each INTERPOL-coordinated operation builds on the last, deepening cooperation, increasing information sharing and developing investigative skills across member countries,” Valdecy Urquiza, secretary general of INTERPOL, said. “With more contributions and shared expertise, the results keep growing in scale and impact. This global network is stronger than ever, delivering real outcomes and safeguarding victims.”
Singapore-headquartered Group-IB said it provided “circumstantial intelligence” on a cryptocurrency investment scam, along with infrastructural details associated with the scam and other BEC campaigns across the African region. “Cybercrime recognizes no borders, and its impact is truly global,” Dmitry Volkov, Group-IB CEO,
said
.</p>

<p>“The success of Operation Serengeti 2.0 demonstrates what can be achieved when nations stand together against this threat.”
The disclosure comes as Nigeria
deported
102 foreign nationals, including
60 Chinese and 39 people from the Philippines
, who were convicted of cyber terrorism and internet fraud, according to the country’s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The deportees were among
792 suspected cybercriminals
arrested in December 2024. Earlier this March, law enforcement authorities in seven African countries also
arrested
306 suspects and confiscated 1,842 devices as part of an international operation codenamed Red Card that took place between November 2024 and February 2025. Found this article interesting?</p>

<h2 id="ex-developer-jailed-four-years-for-sabotaging-ohio-employer-with-kill-switch-malware"><a id="article-5"></a>Ex-Developer Jailed Four Years for Sabotaging Ohio Employer with Kill-Switch Malware</h2>

<p>A 55-year-old Chinese national has been sentenced to four years in prison and three years of supervised release for sabotaging his former employer’s network with custom malware and deploying a kill switch that locked out employees when his account was disabled. Davis Lu, 55, of Houston, Texas, was
convicted
of causing intentional damage to protected computers in March 2025. He was
arrested and charged
in April 2021 for abusing his position as a software developer to execute malicious code on his employer’s computer servers. “The defendant breached his employer’s trust by using his access and technical knowledge to sabotage company networks, wreaking havoc and causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses for a U.S.</p>

<p>company,”
said
Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R. Galeotti of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “However, the defendant’s technical savvy and subterfuge did not save him from the consequences of his actions.”
Court documents show that Lu was employed as a software developer for the unnamed company based in Ohio from November 2007 to October 2019. But after his responsibilities and system access were reduced following a 2018 corporate realignment, Lu enacted a scheme to deliberately introduce malicious code around August 2019, resulting in system crashes and preventing user logins.</p>

<p>To pull this off, Lu is said to have created infinite loops in source code to trigger server crashes by repeatedly creating new Java threads without proper termination. He also deleted coworker profile files and implemented a kill switch that would lock out all users if his credentials in the company’s Active Directory were disabled. “The ‘kill switch’ code – which Lu named ‘IsDLEnabledinAD,’ abbreviating ‘Is Davis Lu enabled in Active Directory’ — was automatically activated when he was placed on leave and asked to surrender his laptop on September 9, 2019, and impacted thousands of company users globally,” the Department of Justice said. “Lu named other code ‘Hakai,’ a Japanese word meaning ‘destruction,’ and ‘HunShui,’ a Chinese word meaning ‘sleep’ or ‘lethargy.’”
Furthermore, on the day Lu was instructed to return his company-issued laptop, the defendant deleted encrypted volumes and attempted to erase Linux directories and two additional projects.</p>

<p>His internet search history laid bare the methods he researched to escalate privileges, hide processes, and delete files, suggesting an attempt to obstruct the company’s efforts to resolve the issues. Lu’s unlawful actions are estimated to have cost the company hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses, per the department. This case also underscores the importance of identifying insider threats early, added Assistant Director Brett Leatherman of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Cyber Division.

<h2 id="pre-auth-exploit-chains-found-in-commvault-could-enable-remote-code-execution-attacks"><a id="article-6"></a>Pre-Auth Exploit Chains Found in Commvault Could Enable Remote Code Execution Attacks</h2>

<p>Commvault has released updates to address four security gaps that could be exploited to achieve remote code execution on susceptible instances. The list of vulnerabilities, identified in Commvault versions before 11.36.60, is as follows -
CVE-2025-57788
(CVSS score: 6.9) - A vulnerability in a known login mechanism allows unauthenticated attackers to execute API calls without requiring user credentials
CVE-2025-57789
(CVSS score: 5.3) - A vulnerability during the setup phase between installation and the first administrator login that allows remote attackers to exploit the default credentials to gain admin control
CVE-2025-57790
(CVSS score: 8.7) - A path traversal vulnerability that allows remote attackers to perform unauthorized file system access through a path traversal issue, resulting in remote code execution
CVE-2025-57791
(CVSS score: 6.9) - A vulnerability that allows remote attackers to inject or manipulate command-line arguments passed to internal components due to insufficient input validation, resulting in a valid user session for a low-privilege role
watchTowr Labs researchers Sonny Macdonald and Piotr Bazydlo have been credited with discovering and reporting the four security defects in April 2025. All the flagged vulnerabilities have been resolved in versions 11.32.102 and 11.36.60. Commvault SaaS solution is not affected.</p>

<p>In an
analysis
published Wednesday, the cybersecurity company said threat actors could fashion these vulnerabilities into two pre-authenticated exploit chains to achieve code execution on susceptible instances: One that combines CVE-2025-57791 and CVE-2025-57790, and the other that strings CVE-2025-57788, CVE-2025-57789, and CVE-2025-57790. It’s worth noting that the second pre-auth remote code execution chain becomes successful only if the built-in admin password hasn’t been changed since installation. The disclosure comes nearly four months after watchTowr Labs reported a critical Commvault Command Center flaw (
CVE-2025-34028
, CVSS score: 10.0) that could allow arbitrary code execution on affected installations. A month later, the U.S.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
added
the vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation in the wild. Found this article interesting? Follow us on

<h2 id="cybercriminals-deploy-cornflakev3-backdoor-via-clickfix-tactic-and-fake-captcha-pages"><a id="article-7"></a>Cybercriminals Deploy CORNFLAKE.V3 Backdoor via ClickFix Tactic and Fake CAPTCHA Pages</h2>

<p>Threat actors have been observed leveraging the deceptive social engineering tactic known as
ClickFix
to deploy a versatile backdoor codenamed CORNFLAKE.V3. Google-owned Mandiant
described
the activity, which it tracks as UNC5518, as part of an access-as-a-service scheme that employs fake CAPTCHA pages as lures to trick users into providing initial access to their systems, which is then monetized by other threat groups. “The initial infection vector, dubbed ClickFix, involves luring users on compromised websites to copy a malicious PowerShell script and execute it via the Windows Run dialog box,” Google
said
in a report published today. The access provided by UNC5518 is assessed to be leveraged by at least two different hacking groups, UNC5774 and UNC4108, to initiate a multi-stage infection process and drop additional payloads -
UNC5774, another financially motivated group that delivers CORNFLAKE as a way to deploy various subsequent payloads
UNC4108, a threat actor with unknown motivation that uses PowerShell to deploy tools like VOLTMARKER and NetSupport RAT
The attack chain likely begins with the victim landing a fake CAPTCHA verification page after interacting with search results that employ search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning or malicious ads.</p>

<p>The user is then tricked into running a malicious PowerShell command by launching the Windows Run dialog, which then executes the next-stage dropper payload from a remote server. The newly downloaded script checks if it’s running within a virtualized environment and ultimately launches CORNFLAKE.V3. Observed in both JavaScript and PHP versions, CORNFLAKE.V3 is a backdoor that supports the execution of payloads via HTTP, including executables, dynamic-link libraries (DLLs), JavaScript files, batch scripts, and PowerShell commands. It can also collect basic system information and transmit it to an external server.</p>

<p>The traffic is proxied through Cloudflare tunnels in an attempt to avoid detection. “CORNFLAKE.V3 is an updated version of CORNFLAKE.V2, sharing a significant portion of its codebase,” Mandiant researcher Marco Galli said. “Unlike V2, which functioned solely as a downloader, V3 features host persistence via a registry Run key, and supports additional payload types.”
Both generations are markedly different from their progenitor, a C-based downloader that uses TCP sockets for command-and-control (C2) communications and only has the ability to run DLL payloads. Persistence on the host is achieved by means of Windows Registry changes.</p>

<p>At least three different payloads are delivered via CORNFLAKE.V3. This comprises an Active Directory reconnaissance utility, a script to harvest credentials via Kerberoasting, and another backdoor referred to as WINDYTWIST.SEA, a C version of WINDYTWIST that supports relaying TCP traffic, providing a reverse shell, executing commands, and removing itself. Select versions of WINDYTWIST.SEA have also been observed attempting to move laterally in the network of the infected machine. “To mitigate malware execution through ClickFix, organizations should disable the Windows Run dialog box where possible,” Galli said.</p>

<p>“Regular simulation exercises are crucial to counter this and other social engineering tactics. Furthermore, robust logging and monitoring systems are essential for detecting the execution of subsequent payloads, such as those associated with CORNFLAKE.V3.”
The Rise of ClicFix Kits
The use of ClickFix has soared in popularity among threat actors over the past year, as it dupes users into infected their machines under the pretext of helping the solve minor technical issues, completing CAPTCHA verification checks by impersonating Cloudflare Turnstile, or spoofing a Discord server supposedly needing to verify a user before they can join. This, in turn, entails giving users instructions that involve clicking prompts and copying, pasting, and running commands directly in the Windows Run dialog box, Windows Terminal, Windows PowerShell, or macOS Terminal, depending on the operating system used. “Because ClickFix relies on human intervention to launch the malicious commands, a campaign that uses this technique could get past conventional and automated security solutions,” Microsoft
said
in a detailed write-up.</p>

<p>“It’s often combined with delivery vectors such as phishing, malvertising, and drive-by compromises, most of which even impersonate legitimate brands and organizations to further reduce suspicion from their targets.”
The social engineering ploy has been embraced by numerous threat actors to deliver information stealers (
Lumma Stealer
), remote access trojans (Xworm, AsyncRAT, NetSupport RAT, and SectopRAT), malware loaders (Latrodectus and MintsLoader), rootkits (r77), and banking trojans (
Lampion
). Microsoft said it has also observed several threat actors peddling configurable ClickFix builders (also called “Win + R”) on popular cybercrime forums since late 2024 from anywhere $200 to $1,500 per month. Other offerings include one-time and piece-meal solutions, for example, the source code, landing page, or the command-line used to kick off the infection, for prices between $200 and $500. “Some of these actors are bundling ClickFix builders into their existing kits that already generate various files such as LNK, JavaScript, and SVG files,” the Windows maker said.</p>

<p>“The kits offer creation of landing pages with a variety of available lures including Cloudflare.”
“They also offer construction of malicious commands that users will paste into the Windows Run dialog. These kits claim to guarantee antivirus and web protection bypass (some even promise that they can bypass Microsoft Defender SmartScreen), as well as payload persistence.”
To counter ClickFix-style attacks, it’s advised that users are educated to identify social engineering attacks and be careful of what’s being pasted in apps like Terminal or PowerShell. Organizations are recommended to consider using enterprise-managed browsers, block web pages from automatically running Flash plugins, and turn on safe attachments policies for incoming messages. Other steps include -
Enable
PowerShell script block logging
to detect and analyze obfuscated or encoded commands for enhanced visibility
Use
PowerShell execution policies
such as setting AllSigned or RemoteSigned to help reduce the risk of malicious execution
Use Group Policy to deploy hardening configurations, such as removing Run menu from Start Menu,
prohibiting the launch of native Windows binaries
from Run, and
configuring Windows Terminal access
to alert users when they pasting text that contains multiple lines
USB Infection Drops XMRig Miner
The disclosure comes as the threat intelligence firm detailed an ongoing campaign that employs USB drives to infect other hosts and deploy cryptocurrency miners since September 2024.</p>

<p>“This demonstrates the continued effectiveness of initial access via infected USB drives,” Mandiant
said
. “The low cost and ability to bypass network security make this technique a compelling option for attackers.”
The attack chain starts when a victim is tricked into executing a Windows shortcut (LNK) in the compromised USB drive. The LNK file results in the execution of a Visual Basic script also located in the same folder. The script, for its part, launches a batch script to initiate the infection -
DIRTYBULK
, a C++ DLL launcher to initiate the execution of other malicious components, such as CUTFAIL
CUTFAIL
, a C++ malware dropper responsible for decrypting and installing malware onto a system, such as HIGHREPS and PUMPBENCH, as well as third-libraries like OpenSSL, libcurl, and WinPthreadGC
HIGHREPS
, a downloader that retrieves additional files to ensure persistence of PUMPBENCH
PUMPBENCH
, a C++ backdoor that facilitates reconnaissance, provides remote access by communicating with a PostgreSQL database server, and download XMRig
XMRig
, an an open-source software for mining cryptocurrencies such as Monero, Dero, and Ravencoin
“PUMPBENCH spreads by infecting USB drives,” Mandiant said.</p>

<p>“It scans the system for available drives and then creates a batch file, a VBScript file, a shortcut file, and a DAT file.”

<h2 id="weak-passwords-and-compromised-accounts-key-findings-from-the-blue-report-2025"><a id="article-8"></a>Weak Passwords and Compromised Accounts: Key Findings from the Blue Report 2025</h2>

<p>As security professionals, it’s easy to get caught up in a race to counter the latest advanced adversary techniques. Yet the most impactful attacks
often aren’t from cutting-edge exploits, but from cracked credentials and compromised accounts
. Despite widespread awareness of this threat vector, Picus Security’s
Blue Report 2025
shows that organizations continue to struggle with
preventing password cracking attacks
and
detecting the malicious use of compromised accounts
. With the first half of 2025 behind us,
compromised valid accounts remain the most underprevented attack vector
, highlighting the urgent need for a
proactive approach focused on the threats that are evading organizations’ defenses.</p>

<p>A Wake-Up Call: The Alarming Rise in Password Cracking Success
The
Picus Blue Report
is an annual research publication that analyzes how well organizations are preventing and detecting real-world cyber threats. Unlike traditional reports that focus solely on threat trends or survey data, the Blue Report is based on
empirical findings from over 160 million attack simulations
conducted within organizations’ networks around the world, using the
Picus Security Validation Platform
. In the
Blue Report 2025
, Picus Labs found that
password cracking attempts succeeded in 46% of tested environments
, nearly doubling the success rate from last year. This sharp increase highlights a fundamental weakness in how organizations are managing – or mismanaging – their password policies.</p>

<p>Weak passwords
and
outdated hashing algorithms
continue to leave critical systems vulnerable to attackers using
brute-force
or
rainbow table attacks
to crack passwords and gain unauthorized access. Given that password cracking is one of the
oldest and most reliably effective attack methods
, this finding points to a serious issue: in their race to combat the latest, most sophisticated new breed of threats,
many organizations are failing to enforce strong basic password hygiene policies while failing to adopt and integrate modern authentication practices into their defenses
. Why Organizations Are Failing to Prevent Password Cracking Attacks
So, why are organizations still failing to prevent password cracking attacks? The root cause lies in the
continued use of weak passwords
and
outdated credential storage methods
.</p>

<p>Many organizations still rely on easily guessable passwords and weak hashing algorithms, often without using proper salting techniques or multi-factor authentication (MFA). In fact, our survey results showed that
46% of environments
had at least one password hash cracked
and converted to cleartext, highlighting the inadequacy of many password policies, particularly for
internal accounts
, where controls are often more lax than they are for their external counterparts. To combat this, organizations must
enforce stronger password policies
,
implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users
, and
regularly validate their credential defenses
. Without these improvements, attackers will continue to compromise valid accounts, obtaining easy access to critical systems.</p>

<p>Credential-Based Attacks: A Silent but Devastating Threat
The threat of
credential abuse
is both pervasive and dangerous, yet as the
Blue Report 2025
highlights, organizations are still
underprepared
for this form of attack. And once attackers obtain valid credentials, they can
easily move laterally
,
escalate privileges
, and
compromise critical systems
. Infostealers
and
ransomware groups
frequently rely on stolen credentials to
spread across networks
, burrowing deeper and deeper, often
without triggering detection
. This
stealthy movement
within the network allows attackers to
maintain long dwell times
, undetected, while they
exfiltrate data at will
.</p>

<p>Despite this ongoing and well-known issue, organizations continue to prioritize perimeter defenses, often leaving
identity and credential protection
overlooked and under-funded as a result. This year’s Blue Report clearly shows that
valid account abuse
is at the core of modern cyberattacks, reinforcing the urgent need for a stronger focus on
identity security
and
credential validation
. Valid Accounts (T1078): The Most Exploited Path to Compromise
One of the key findings in the
Blue Report 2025
is that
Valid Accounts (MITRE ATT&amp;CK T1078)
remains the
most exploited attack technique
, with a truly concerning
98% success rate
. This means that once attackers gain access to valid credentials, whether through
password cracking
or
initial access brokers
, they can swiftly move through an organization’s network, often bypassing traditional defenses.</p>

<p>The use of
compromised credentials
is particularly effective because it allows attackers to
operate under the radar
, making it harder for security teams to detect malicious activity. Once inside, they can
access sensitive data
,
deploy malware
, or
create new attack paths
, all while seamlessly blending in with legitimate user activity. How to Strengthen Your Defenses Against Credential Abuse and Password Cracking
To protect against increasingly effective attacks, organizations should
implement stronger password policies
and enforce
complexity requirements
, while eliminating outdated hashing algorithms in favor of more secure alternatives. It is also essential to
adopt multi-factor authentication (MFA)
for all sensitive accounts, ensuring that even if credentials do become compromised, attackers can’t just use them to access the network without an additional verification step.</p>

<p>Regularly validating
credential defenses
through
simulated attacks
is crucial to identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring that your controls are performing as expected. Organizations also need to
enhance their behavioral detection capabilities
to catch
anomalous activities
tied to credential abuse and lateral movement. Additionally, monitoring and inspecting
outbound traffic
for signs of
data exfiltration
and ensuring that
data loss prevention (DLP) measures
are both in place and operating effectively are critical to protecting your sensitive information. Closing the Gaps in Credential and Password Management
The findings in the Blue Report 2025 show that, unfortunately, many organizations are still vulnerable to the silent threat of
password cracking
and
compromised accounts
.</p>

<p>And while strengthening perimeter defenses continues to be a priority, it’s also clear that
core weaknesses lie in credential management and internal controls
. The report also highlighted the fact that
infostealers
and
ransomware groups
are leveraging these gaps effectively. If you’re ready to take proactive steps to
harden your security posture
,
reduce your exposure
, and
prioritize your critical vulnerabilities
, the
Blue Report 2025
offers invaluable insights to show you where to focus. And at
Picus Security
, we’re always happy to talk about helping your organization meet its specific security needs..</p>

<h2 id="hackers-using-new-quirkyloader-malware-to-spread-agent-tesla-asyncrat-and-snake-keylogger"><a id="article-9"></a>Hackers Using New QuirkyLoader Malware to Spread Agent Tesla, AsyncRAT and Snake Keylogger</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a new malware loader called
QuirkyLoader
that’s being used to deliver via email spam campaigns an array of next-stage payloads ranging from information stealers to remote access trojans since November 2024. Some of the notable malware families distributed using QuirkyLoader include
Agent Tesla
,
AsyncRAT
,
Formbook
,
Masslogger
,
Remcos RAT
,
Rhadamanthys Stealer
, and
Snake Keylogger
. IBM X-Force, which detailed the malware, said the attacks involve sending spam emails from both legitimate email service providers and a self-hosted email server. These emails feature a malicious archive, which contains a DLL, an encrypted payload, and a real executable.</p>

<p>“The actor uses DLL side-loading, a technique where launching the legitimate executable also loads the malicious DLL,” security researcher Raymond Joseph Alfonso
said
. “This DLL, in turn, loads, decrypts, and injects the final payload into its target process.”
This is achieved by using process hollowing to inject the malware into one of the three processes: AddInProcess32.exe, InstallUtil.exe, or aspnet_wp.exe. The DLL loader, per IBM, has been used in limited campaigns for the past few months, with two campaigns observed in July 2025 targeting Taiwan and Mexico. The campaign targeting Taiwan is said to have specifically singled out employees of Nusoft Taiwan, a network and internet security research company based in New Taipei City, with the goal of infecting them with Snake Keylogger, which is capable of stealing sensitive information from popular web browsers, keystrokes, and clipboard content.</p>

<p>The Mexico-related campaign, on the other hand, is assessed to be random, with the infection chains delivering Remcos RAT and AsyncRAT. “The threat actor consistently writes the DLL loader module in .NET languages and uses ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation,” Alfonso said. “This process compiles the code into native machine code before execution, making the resulting binary appear as though it were written in C or C++.”
New Phishing Trends
The development comes as threat actors are using new QR code phishing (aka quishing) tactics like splitting malicious QR codes into two parts or embedding them within legitimate ones in email messages propagated via phishing kits like
Gabagool
and Tycoon, respectively, to evade detection, demonstrating ongoing evolution. “Malicious QR codes are popular with attackers for several reasons,” Barracuda researcher Rohit Suresh Kanase
said
.</p>

<p>“They cannot be read by humans so don’t raise any red flags, and they can often bypass traditional security measures such as email filters and link scanners.”
“Furthermore, since recipients often have to switch to a mobile device to scan the code, it can take users out of the company security perimeter and away from protection.”
The findings also follow the emergence of a phishing kit used by the
PoisonSeed
threat actor to acquire credentials and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes from individuals and organizations to gain access to victims’ accounts and use them to send emails for carrying out cryptocurrency scams. “The domains hosting this phishing kit impersonate login services from prominent CRM and bulk email companies like Google, SendGrid, Mailchimp, and likely others, targeting individuals’ credentials,” NVISO Labs
said
. “PoisonSeed employs spear-phishing emails embedding malicious links, which redirect victims to their phishing kit.”
A noteworthy aspect of the kit is the use of a technique known as
precision-validated phishing
in which the attacker validates an email address in real-time in the background, while a fake Cloudflare Turnstile challenge is served to the user. Once the checks are passed, a login form impersonating the legitimate online platform appears, allowing the threat actors to capture submitted credentials and then relay them to the service.</p>

<h2 id="scattered-spider-hacker-gets-10-years-13m-restitution-for-sim-swapping-crypto-theft"><a id="article-10"></a>Scattered Spider Hacker Gets 10 Years, $13M Restitution for SIM Swapping Crypto Theft</h2>

<p>A 20-year-old member of the notorious cybercrime gang known as
Scattered Spider
has been
sentenced
to
ten years
in prison in the U.S. in connection with a series of major hacks and cryptocurrency thefts. Noah Michael Urban
pleaded guilty
to charges related to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft back in April 2025. News of Urban’s sentencing was reported by
Bloomberg
and Jacksonville news outlet
News4JAX
.</p>

<p>In addition, 120 months in federal prison, Urban faces an additional three years of supervised release and has been ordered to pay $13 million in restitution to victims. In a statement
shared
with security journalist Brian Krebs, Urban called the sentence unjust. Urban, who also went by the aliases Sosa, Elijah, King Bob, Gustavo Fring, and Anthony Ramirez, was
arrested
by U.S. authorities in Florida in January 2024 for committing wire fraud and aggravated identity theft between August 2022 and March 2023.</p>

<p>These incidents led to the theft of at least $800,000 from at least five different victims, per the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ). Prosecutors said Urban and his co-conspirators engaged in SIM swapping attacks to hijack victims’ cryptocurrency accounts and plunder the digital assets. Later that November, the DoJ
unsealed
criminal charges against Urban and four other members of Scattered Spider for using social engineering techniques to target employees of companies across the U.S.</p>

<p>and to break into corporate networks and steal proprietary data and to siphon millions of dollars in cryptocurrency. Tyler Robert Buchanan, who is among those indicted, was extradited from Spain to the U.S. in April following his
arrest
in the European nation last June. The development comes as Scattered Spider has
joined forces
with other threat groups ShinyHunters and LAPSUS$ to form a new cybercrime alliance.</p>

<p>The group, associated with a broader English-speaking cybercriminal collective called The Com, has a history of conducting social engineering, credential theft, and SIM swapping, initial access, ransomware deployment, data theft, and extortion attacks. “Scattered Spider has historically leaned on tactics that generate urgency, drive media and industry attention, create fear of exposure, and help force victims to payout quicker,” Adam Darrah, vice president of intelligence at ZeroFox, told The Hacker News in a statement. “Timed leaks, countdown threats, and taunts directed at security firms are all part of their playbook. They have ties to a wider network of like-minded actors, which has given them access to more tools, data, and infrastructure, multiplying their effectiveness.</p>

<p>We regularly see groups team up when there is an increase in external pressures, like law enforcement crackdowns. To survive, these groups need to consolidate. And the result is often a more versatile and potentially dangerous combined operation.”
Cybersecurity firm Flashpoint, which published a profile of Scattered Spider last week, said the financially-motivated hacking group adopts a wave-like approach by choosing a specific sector and attacking as many organizations within that vertical over a short span of time. “The tactics employed by Scattered Spider demonstrate their ability to exploit weaknesses in security programs by targeting people rather than strictly systems or technical vulnerabilities,” it
said
.</p>

<p>“Their use of social engineering, via vishing, smishing, and MFA fatigue attacks, proves that even the most advanced technical defenses can be circumvented through human deception.”

<h2 id="apple-patches-cve-2025-43300-zero-day-in-ios-ipados-and-macos-exploited-in-targeted-attacks"><a id="article-11"></a>Apple Patches CVE-2025-43300 Zero-Day in iOS, iPadOS, and macOS Exploited in Targeted Attacks</h2>

<p>Apple has released security updates to address a security flaw impacting iOS, iPadOS, and macOS that it said has come under active exploitation in the wild. The zero-day out-of-bounds write vulnerability, tracked as
CVE-2025-43300
(CVSS score: 8.8), resides in the
ImageIO framework
that could result in memory corruption when processing a malicious image. “Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals,” the company said in an advisory. The iPhone maker said the bug was internally discovered and that it was addressed with improved bounds checking.</p>

<p>The following versions address the security defect -
iOS 18.6.2 and iPadOS 18.6.2</p>
<ul>
  <li>iPhone XS and later, iPad Pro 13-inch, iPad Pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation and later, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 7th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later
iPadOS 17.7.10</li>
  <li>iPad Pro 12.9-inch 2nd generation, iPad Pro 10.5-inch, and iPad 6th generation
macOS Ventura 13.7.8</li>
  <li>Macs running macOS Ventura
macOS Sonoma 14.7.8</li>
  <li>Macs running macOS Sonoma
macOS Sequoia 15.6.1</li>
  <li>Macs running macOS Sequoia
It’s currently not known who is behind the attacks and who may have been targeted, but it’s likely that the vulnerability has been weaponised as part of highly targeted attacks. With the latest update, Apple has so far fixed a total of seven zero-days that have been abused in real-world attacks since the start of the year:
CVE-2025-24085
,
CVE-2025-24200
,
CVE-2025-24201
,
CVE-2025-31200, CVE-2025-31201
, and
CVE-2025-43200
. Last month, the company also issued patches for a Safari vulnerability residing in an open-source component (
CVE-2025-6558
) that Google reported as having been exploited as a zero-day in the Chrome web browser. Found this article interesting?</li>

<h2 id="dom-based-extension-clickjacking-exposes-popular-password-managers-to-credential-and-data-theft"><a id="article-12"></a>DOM-Based Extension Clickjacking Exposes Popular Password Managers to Credential and Data Theft</h2>

<p>Popular password manager plugins for web browsers have been found susceptible to clickjacking security vulnerabilities that could be exploited to steal account credentials, two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, and credit card details under certain conditions. The technique has been dubbed Document Object Model (
DOM
)-based extension clickjacking by independent security researcher Marek Tóth, who
presented the findings
at the DEF CON 33 security conference earlier this month. “A single click anywhere on an attacker-controlled website could allow attackers to steal users’ data (credit card details, personal data, login credentials, including TOTP),” Tóth
said
. “The new technique is general and can be applied to other types of extensions.”
Clickjacking
, also called UI redressing, refers to a type of attack in which users are tricked into performing a series of actions on a website that appear ostensibly harmless, such as clicking on buttons, when, in reality, they are inadvertently carrying out the attacker’s bidding.</p>

<p>The new technique detailed by Tóth essentially involves using a malicious script to manipulate UI elements in a web page that browser extensions inject into the DOM – for example, auto-fill prompts, by making them invisible by setting their opacity to zero. The research specifically focused on 11 popular password manager browser add-ons, ranging from 1Password to iCloud Passwords, all of which have been found to be susceptible to DOM-based extension clickjacking. Collectively, these extensions have millions of users. To pull off the attack, all a bad actor has to do is create a fake site with an intrusive pop-up, such as a login screen or a cookie consent banner, while embedding an invisible login form such that clicking on the site to close the pop-up causes the credential information to be auto-filled by the password manager and exfiltrated to a remote server.</p>

<p>“All password managers filled credentials not only to the ‘main’ domain, but also to all subdomains,” Tóth explained. “An attacker could easily find XSS or other vulnerabilities and steal the user’s stored credentials with a single click (10 out of 11), including TOTP (9 out of 11). In some scenarios, passkey authentication could also be exploited (8 out of 11).”
Following responsible disclosure, six of the vendors have yet to release fixes for the defect -
1Password Password Manager 8.11.4.27
Apple iCloud Passwords 3.1.25
Bitwarden Password Manager 2025.7.0
Enpass 6.11.6
LastPass 4.146.3
LogMeOnce 7.12.4
Software supply chain security firm Socket, which independently reviewed the research,
said
Bitwarden, Enpass, and iCloud Passwords are actively working on fixes, while 1Password and LastPass marked them as informative. It has also reached out to US-CERT to assign CVE identifiers for the identified issues.</p>

<p>Until fixes are available, it’s advised that users disable the auto-fill function in their password managers and only use copy/paste. “For Chromium-based browser users, it is recommended to configure site access to ‘on click’ in extension settings,” Tóth said. “This configuration allows users to manually control auto-fill functionality.”
Update
Bitwarden has released
version 2025.8.0
of the password manager to address the clickjacking vulnerabilities. It is also advising users to pay close attention to website URLs and stay alert for phishing campaigns to avoid malicious websites.</p>
