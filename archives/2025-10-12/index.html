<h2 id="experts-warn-of-widespread-sonicwall-vpn-compromise-impacting-over-100-accounts"><a id="article-1"></a>Experts Warn of Widespread SonicWall VPN Compromise Impacting Over 100 Accounts</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity company Huntress on Friday warned of ‚Äúwidespread compromise‚Äù of SonicWall SSL VPN devices to access multiple customer environments. ‚ÄúThreat actors are authenticating into multiple accounts rapidly across compromised devices,‚Äù it
said
. ‚ÄúThe speed and scale of these attacks imply that the attackers appear to control valid credentials rather than brute-forcing.‚Äù
A significant chunk of the activity is said to have commenced on October 4, 2025, with more than 100 SonicWall SSL VPN accounts across 16 customer accounts having been impacted. In the cases investigated by Huntress, authentications on the SonicWall devices originated from the IP address 202.155.8[.]73.</p>

<p>The company noted that in some instances, the threat actors did not engage in further adversarial actions in the network and disconnected after a short period of time. However, in other cases, the attackers have been found conducting network scanning activity and attempting to access numerous local Windows accounts. The disclosure comes shortly after SonicWall
acknowledged
that a security incident resulted in the unauthorized exposure of firewall configuration backup files stored in MySonicWall accounts. The breach, according to the latest update,
affects
all customers who have used SonicWall‚Äôs cloud backup service.</p>

<p>‚ÄúFirewall configuration files store sensitive information that can be leveraged by threat actors to exploit and gain access to an organization‚Äôs network,‚Äù Arctic Wolf
said
. ‚ÄúThese files can provide threat actors with critical information such as user, group, and domain settings, DNS and log settings, and certificates.‚Äù
Huntress, however, noted that there is no evidence at this stage to link the breach to the recent spike in compromises. Considering that sensitive credentials are stored within firewall configurations, organizations using the MySonicWall cloud configuration backup service are advised to reset their credentials on live firewall devices to avoid unauthorized access. It‚Äôs also recommended to restrict WAN management and remote access where possible, revoke any external API keys that touch the firewall or management systems, monitor logins for signs of suspicious activity, and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all admin and remote accounts.</p>

<p>The disclosure comes amid an
increase
in
ransomware activity
targeting SonicWall firewall devices for initial access, with the attacks leveraging known security flaws (
CVE-2024-40766
) to breach target networks for deploying Akira ransomware. Darktrace, in a report published this week, said it detected an intrusion targeting an unnamed U.S. customer in late August 2025 that involved network scanning, reconnaissance, lateral movement, privilege escalation using techniques like UnPAC the hash, and data exfiltration. ‚ÄúOne of the compromised devices was later identified as a SonicWall virtual private network (VPN) server, suggesting that the incident was part of the broader Akira ransomware campaign targeting SonicWall technology,‚Äù it
said
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis campaign by Akira ransomware actors underscores the critical importance of maintaining up-to-date patching practices. Threat actors continue to exploit previously disclosed vulnerabilities, not just zero-days, highlighting the need for ongoing vigilance even after patches are released.‚Äù

<h2 id="hackers-turn-velociraptor-dfir-tool-into-weapon-in-lockbit-ransomware-attacks"><a id="article-2"></a>Hackers Turn Velociraptor DFIR Tool Into Weapon in LockBit Ransomware Attacks</h2>

<p>Threat actors are abusing Velociraptor, an open-source digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) tool, in connection with ransomware attacks likely orchestrated by
Storm-2603
(aka CL-CRI-1040 or Gold Salem), which is known for deploying the Warlock and LockBit ransomware. The threat actor‚Äôs use of the security utility was
documented
by Sophos last month. It‚Äôs assessed that the attackers weaponized the on-premises SharePoint vulnerabilities known as ToolShell to obtain initial access and deliver an outdated version of Velociraptor (version 0.73.4.0) that‚Äôs susceptible to a privilege escalation vulnerability (
CVE-2025-6264
) to enable arbitrary command execution and endpoint takeover, per
Cisco Talos
. In the attack in mid-August 2025, the threat actors are said to have made attempts to escalate privileges by creating domain admin accounts and moving laterally within the compromised environment, as well as leveraging the access to run tools like Smbexec to remotely launch programs using the SMB protocol.</p>

<p>Prior to data exfiltration and dropping Warlock, LockBit, and Babuk, the adversary has been found to modify Active Directory (AD) Group Policy Objects (GPOs), turn off real-time protection to tamper with system defenses, and evade detection. The findings mark the first time Storm-2603 has been linked to the deployment of Babuk ransomware. Rapid7, which maintains Velociraptor after acquiring it in 2021, previously
told
The Hacker News that it‚Äôs aware of the misuse of the tool, and that it can also be abused when in the wrong hands, just like other security and administrative tools. ‚ÄúThis behavior reflects a misuse pattern rather than a software flaw: adversaries simply repurpose legitimate collection and orchestration capabilities,‚Äù Christiaan Beek, Rapid7‚Äôs senior director of threat analytics,
said
in response to the latest reported attacks.</p>

<p>According to Halcyon, Storm-2603 is believed to share some connections to Chinese nation-state actors owing to its early access to the ToolShell exploit and the emergence of new samples that exhibit professional-grade development practices consistent with sophisticated hacking groups. The ransomware crew, which
first emerged
in June 2025, has since used LockBit as both an operational tool and a development foundation. It‚Äôs worth noting that Warlock was the final affiliate registered with the LockBit scheme under the name ‚Äúwlteaml‚Äù before LockBit
suffered a data leak
a month before. ‚ÄúWarlock planned from the beginning to deploy multiple ransomware families to confuse attribution, evade detection, and accelerate impact,‚Äù the company
said
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWarlock demonstrates the discipline, resources, and access characteristic of nation-state‚Äìaligned threat actors, not opportunistic ransomware crews.‚Äù
Halcyon also pointed out the threat actor‚Äôs 48-hour development cycles for feature additions, reflective of structured team workflows. This centralized, organized project structure suggests a team with dedicated infrastructure and tooling, it added. Other notable aspects that suggest ties to Chinese state-sponsored actors include -
Use of operational security (OPSEC) measures, such as stripped timestamps and intentionally corrupted expiration mechanisms
The compilation of ransomware payloads at 22:58-22:59 China Standard Time and packaging them into a malicious installer at 01:55 the next morning
Consistent contact information and shared, misspelled domains across Warlock, LockBit, and Babuk deployments, suggesting cohesive command-and-control (C2) operations and not opportunistic infrastructure reuse
A deeper examination of Storm-2603‚Äôs development timeline has uncovered that the threat actor established the infrastructure for
AK47 C2 framework
in March 2025, and then created the first prototype of the tool the next month. In April, it also pivoted from LockBit-only deployment to dual LockBit/Warlock deployment within a span of 48 hours.</p>

<p>While it subsequently registered as a LockBit affiliate, work continued on its own ransomware until it was formally launched under the Warlock branding in June. Weeks later, the threat actor was observed leveraging the ToolShell exploit as a zero-day while also deploying Babuk ransomware starting July 21, 2025. ‚ÄúThe group‚Äôs rapid evolution in April from the LockBit 3.0-only deployment to a multi-ransomware deployment 48 hours later, followed by Babuk deployment in July, shows operational flexibility, detection evasion capabilities, attribution confusion tactics, and sophisticated builder expertise using leaked and open-source ransomware frameworks,‚Äù Halcyon said.

<h2 id="stealit-malware-abuses-nodejs-single-executable-feature-via-game-and-vpn-installers"><a id="article-3"></a>Stealit Malware Abuses Node.js Single Executable Feature via Game and VPN Installers</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of an active malware campaign called
Stealit
that has leveraged Node.js‚Äô Single Executable Application (SEA) feature as a way to distribute its payloads. According to Fortinet FortiGuard Labs, select iterations have also employed the open-source Electron framework to deliver the malware. It‚Äôs assessed that the malware is being propagated through counterfeit installers for games and VPN applications that are uploaded to file-sharing sites such as Mediafire and Discord. SEA is a
feature
that allows Node.js applications to be packaged and distributed as a standalone executable, even on systems without Node.js installed.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBoth approaches are effective for distributing Node.js-based malware, as they allow execution without requiring a pre-installed Node.js runtime or additional dependencies,‚Äù security researchers Eduardo Altares and Joie Salvio
said
in a report shared with The Hacker News. On a dedicated website, the threat actors behind Stealit claim to offer ‚Äúprofessional data extraction solutions‚Äù via several subscription plans. This includes a remote access trojan (RAT) that supports file extraction, webcam control, live screen monitoring, and ransomware deployment targeting both Android and Windows operating systems. Prices for the Windows Stealer range from $29.99 for a weekly subscription to $499.99 for a lifetime license.</p>

<p>The Android RAT pricing, on the other hand, goes from $99.99 all the way to $1,999.99. The fake executables contain an installer that‚Äôs designed to retrieve the main components of the malware retrieved from a command-and-control (C2) and install them, but note that before performing a number of anti-analysis checks to ensure it‚Äôs running inside a virtual or sandboxed environment. A crucial aspect of this step involves writing a Base64-encoded authentication key, a 12-character alphanumeric key, to the %temp%\cache.json file. This key is used to authenticate with the C2 server, as well as by subscribers to log in to the dashboard in order to likely monitor and control their victims.</p>

<p>The malware is also engineered to configure Microsoft Defender Antivirus exclusions so that the folder that contains the downloaded components is not flagged. The functions of the three executables are as follows -
save_data.exe
, which is only downloaded and executed if the malware is running with elevated privileges. It‚Äôs designed to drop a tool named ‚Äúcache.exe‚Äù ‚Äì which is part of open-source project
ChromElevator
‚Äì to extract information from Chromium-based browsers. stats_db.exe
, which is designed to extract information from messengers (Telegram, WhatsApp), cryptocurrency wallets and wallet browser extensions (Atomic and Exodus), and game-related apps (Steam, Minecraft, GrowTopia, and Epic Games Launcher).</p>

<p>game_cache.exe
, which is designed to set up persistence on the host by launching its upon system reboot by creating a Visual Basic script and communicating with the C2 server to stream a victim‚Äôs screen in real-time, execute arbitrary commands, download/upload files, and change desktop wallpaper. ‚ÄúThis new Stealit campaign leverages the experimental Node.js Single Executable Application (SEA) feature, which is still under active development, to conveniently distribute malicious scripts to systems without Node.js installed,‚Äù Fortinet said. ‚ÄúThreat actors behind this may be exploiting the feature‚Äôs novelty, relying on the element of surprise, and hoping to catch security applications and malware analysts off guard.‚Äù

<h2 id="microsoft-warns-of-payroll-pirates-hijacking-hr-saas-accounts-to-steal-employee-salaries"><a id="article-4"></a>Microsoft Warns of ‚ÄòPayroll Pirates‚Äô Hijacking HR SaaS Accounts to Steal Employee Salaries</h2>

<p>A threat actor known as
Storm-2657
has been observed hijacking employee accounts with the end goal of diverting salary payments to attacker-controlled accounts. ‚ÄúStorm-2657 is actively targeting a range of U.S.-based organizations, particularly employees in sectors like higher education, to gain access to third-party human resources (HR) software as a service (SaaS) platforms like Workday,‚Äù the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team
said
in a report. However, the tech giant cautioned that any software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform storing HR or payment and bank account information could be a target of such financially motivated campaigns. Some aspects of the campaign, codenamed
Payroll Pirates
, were previously highlighted by Silent Push, Malwarebytes, and Hunt.io.</p>

<p>What makes the attacks notable is that they don‚Äôt exploit any security flaw in the services themselves. Rather, they leverage social engineering tactics and a lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) protections to seize control of employee accounts and ultimately modify payment information to route them to accounts managed by the threat actors. In one campaign observed by Microsoft in the first half of 2025, the attacker is said to have obtained initial access through phishing emails that are designed to harvest their credentials and MFA codes using an adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) phishing link, thereby gaining access to their Exchange Online accounts and taking over Workday profiles through single sign-on (SSO). The threat actors have also been observed creating inbox rules to delete incoming warning notification emails from Workday so as to hide the unauthorized changes made to profiles.</p>

<p>This includes altering the salary payment configuration to redirect future salary payments to accounts under their control. To ensure persistent access to the accounts, the attackers enroll their own phone numbers as MFA devices for victim accounts. What‚Äôs more, the compromised email accounts are used to distribute further phishing emails, both within the organization and to other universities. Microsoft said it observed 11 successfully compromised accounts at three universities since March 2025 that were used to send phishing emails to nearly 6,000 email accounts across 25 universities.</p>

<p>The email messages feature lures related to illnesses or misconduct notices on campus, inducing a false sense of urgency and tricking recipients into clicking on the fake links. To mitigate the risk posed by Storm-2657, it‚Äôs recommended to adopt passwordless, phishing-resistant MFA methods such as FIDO2 security keys, and review accounts for signs of suspicious activity, such as unknown MFA devices and malicious inbox rules.

<h2 id="from-detection-to-patch-fortra-reveals-full-timeline-of-cve-2025-10035-exploitation"><a id="article-5"></a>From Detection to Patch: Fortra Reveals Full Timeline of CVE-2025-10035 Exploitation</h2>

<p>Fortra on Thursday revealed the results of its investigation into
CVE-2025-10035
, a critical security flaw in GoAnywhere Managed File Transfer (MFT) that‚Äôs assessed to have come under active exploitation since at least September 11, 2025. The company
said
it began its investigation on September 11 following a ‚Äúpotential vulnerability‚Äù reported by a customer, uncovering ‚Äúpotentially suspicious activity‚Äù related to the flaw. That same day, Fortra said it contacted on-premises customers who were identified as having their GoAnywhere admin console accessible to the public internet and that it notified law enforcement authorities about the incident. A hotfix for versions 7.6.x, 7.7.x, and 7.8.x of the software was made available the next day, with full releases incorporating the patch ‚Äì versions 7.6.3 and 7.8.4 ‚Äì made available on September 15.</p>

<p>Three days later, a CVE for the vulnerability was formally published, it added. ‚ÄúThe scope of the risk of this vulnerability is limited to customers with an admin console exposed to the public internet,‚Äù Fortra said. ‚ÄúOther web-based components of the GoAnywhere architecture are not affected by this vulnerability.‚Äù
However, it conceded that there are a ‚Äúlimited number of reports‚Äù of unauthorized activity related to CVE-2025-10035. As additional mitigations, the company is recommending that users restrict admin console access over the internet, as well as enable monitoring and keep software up-to-date.</p>

<p>CVE-2025-10035 concerns a case of deserialization vulnerability in the License Servlet that could result in command injection without authentication. In a report earlier this week, Microsoft
revealed
that a threat it tracks as Storm-1175 has been exploiting the flaw since September 11 to deploy Medusa ransomware. That said, there is still no clarity on how the threat actors managed to obtain the private keys needed to exploit this vulnerability. ‚ÄúThe fact that Fortra has now opted to confirm (in their words) ‚Äòunauthorized activity related to CVE-2025-10035‚Äô demonstrates yet again that the vulnerability was not theoretical and that the attacker has somehow circumvented, or satisfied, the cryptographic requirements needed to exploit this vulnerability,‚Äù watchTowr CEO and founder Benjamin Harris said.</p>

<h2 id="weaponized-genai--extortion-first-strategies-fueling-a-new-age-of-ransomware"><a id="article-6"></a>Weaponized GenAI + Extortion-First Strategies Fueling a New Age of Ransomware</h2>

<h2 id="the-ai-soc-stack-of-2026-what-sets-top-tier-platforms-apart"><a id="article-7"></a>The AI SOC Stack of 2026: What Sets Top-Tier Platforms Apart?</h2>

<p>The SOC of 2026 will no longer be a human-only battlefield. As organizations scale and threats evolve in sophistication and velocity, a new generation of AI-powered agents is reshaping how Security Operations Centers (SOCs) detect, respond, and adapt. But not all AI SOC platforms are created equal. From prompt-dependent copilots to autonomous, multi-agent systems, the current market offers everything from smart assistants to force-multiplying automation.</p>

<p>While adoption is still early‚Äî estimated at 1‚Äì5% penetration
according to Gartner
‚Äîthe shift is undeniable. SOC teams must now ask a fundamental question:
What type of AI belongs in my security stack? The Limits of Traditional SOC Automation
Despite promises from legacy SOAR platforms and rule-based SIEM enhancements, many security leaders still face the same core challenges:
Analyst alert fatigue
from redundant low-fidelity triage tasks
Manual context correlation
across disparate tools and logs
Disjointed and static detection and response workflows
Loss of institutional knowledge
during turnover or tool migration
Automation promised to solve this‚Äîbut often came with its own overhead: engineering-intensive setups, brittle playbooks, and limited adaptability to nuanced environments. From Co-Pilots to Cognitive Agents: The Shift to Mesh Agentic Architectures
Many AI-enabled SOC platforms rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) in a co-pilot format: they summarize alerts, generate reports, or offer canned queries - but
require constant human prompting
.</p>

<p>This model delivers surface-level speed, but not scale. The most advanced platforms go further by introducing
mesh agentic architectures
‚Äîa coordinated system of AI agents, each responsible for specialized SOC functions such as triage, threat correlation, evidence assembly, and incident response. Rather than a single model responding to prompts, these systems
autonomously distribute tasks
across AI agents, continuously learning from organizational context, analyst actions, and environmental telemetry. 7 Core Capabilities That Define the Leading AI SOC Platforms
In reviewing today‚Äôs AI SOC landscape, seven defining characteristics consistently separate signal from noise:
Multi-Tier Incident Handling
AI that assists only with Tier-1 triage is table stakes.</p>

<p>Top-tier platforms also support complex Tier-2 and Tier-3 investigations‚Äîincluding lateral movement, EDR, and phishing detections. Contextual Intelligence
Embedding institutional knowledge (risk profiles, security policies, detection engineering, etc.) into the AI‚Äôs operating model and leveraging it automatically during enrichment is critical. This is the difference between generic suggestions and context-aware decisions. Non-Disruptive Integration
Any platform requiring security teams to abandon their existing tools, portals, or daily workflows creates friction.</p>

<p>Leading solutions
work with and within
existing systems‚Äî SIEM, case management, ticketing‚Äîwithout demanding retraining. Adaptive Learning with Telemetry Feedback
Static playbooks are brittle. The most effective AI platforms include continuous learning loops, using past decisions and analyst feedback to tune models and improve future response. Agentic AI Architecture
Platforms leveraging multiple AI engines (LLMs, SLMs, ML classifiers, statistical models, behavior-based engines) outperform those using a monolithic model.</p>

<p>The right architecture selects the right AI tool for each incident type. Transparent Metrics and ROI
Metrics like MTTD/MTTR are just the beginning. Organizations now expect to measure
investigation accuracy
,
analyst productivity uplift
, and
risk reduction curves
. Staged AI Trust Frameworks
Top-performing platforms let SOCs gradually scale autonomy‚Äîstarting with human-in-the-loop and moving toward higher confidence automation as performance is validated.</p>

<p>Spotlight: The Rise of Agentic AI for Security Operations
One emerging platform in this space is Conifers.ai‚Äôs
CognitiveSOC‚Ñ¢
, with its unique implementation of a
mesh agentic AI architecture
. Unlike tools that require constant prompting or scripting, Conifers CognitiveSOC‚Ñ¢ leverages pre-trained, task-specific agents that continuously ingest and apply organizational context and telemetry. These AI SOC agents independently manage and resolve incidents‚Äîwhile maintaining human visibility and control through staged rollout options. The result is a system that
augments the entire SOC pipeline
, not just triage.</p>

<p>It helps teams:
Reduce false positives by up to 80%
Cut MTTD/MTTR by 40‚Äì60%
Handle Tier-2 and Tier-3 investigations without analyst overload
Measure SOC performance with strategic KPIs, not just alert count
For large enterprises, CognitiveSOC bridges the gap between SOC efficiency and effectiveness. For MSSPs, it offers a
true multi-tenant environment
with per-client policy alignment and tenant-specific ROI dashboards. AI in the SOC: Augmentation, Not Autonomy
Despite advances, the idea of a fully autonomous SOC is still more fiction than reality. AI today is best used to
scale human expertise
, not replace it.</p>

<p>It relies on human input and feedback to learn, refine, and improve. With rising threats, analyst burnout, and talent shortages, the choice is no longer whether to adopt AI in the SOC‚Äîbut
how intelligently
you do it. Selecting the right AI architecture could determine whether your team stays ahead of threats‚Äîor falls behind. Final Thoughts
AI in cybersecurity isn‚Äôt about magic‚Äîit‚Äôs about math, models, and mission alignment.</p>

<p>The best platforms won‚Äôt promise hands-off autonomy or results overnight. Instead, they‚Äôll deliver
measurable efficiency
,
increased analyst impact
, and
clear risk reduction
‚Äîwithout forcing you to abandon the tools and teams you trust. As 2026 approaches, SOC teams have a clear mandate:
choose AI platforms that think with you, not just for you. Visit
Conifers.ai
to request a demo and experience how CognitiveSOC may be the right AI SOC platform for your modern SOC.</p>

<h2 id="175-malicious-npm-packages-with-26000-downloads-used-in-credential-phishing-campaign"><a id="article-8"></a>175 Malicious npm Packages with 26,000 Downloads Used in Credential Phishing Campaign</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have flagged a new set of 175 malicious packages on the npm registry that have been used to facilitate credential harvesting attacks as part of an unusual campaign. The packages have been collectively downloaded 26,000 times, acting as an infrastructure for a widespread phishing campaign codenamed
Beamglea
targeting more than 135 industrial, technology, and energy companies across the world, according to Socket. ‚ÄúWhile the packages‚Äô randomized names make accidental developer installation unlikely, the download counts likely include security researchers, automated scanners, and CDN infrastructure analyzing the packages after disclosure,‚Äù security researcher Kush Pandya
said
. The packages have been found to use npm‚Äôs public registry and
unpkg.com‚Äôs CDN
to host redirect scripts that route victims to credential harvesting pages.</p>

<p>Some aspects of the campaign were
first flagged
by Safety‚Äôs Paul McCarty late last month. Specifically, the library comes fitted with a Python file named ‚Äúredirect_generator.py‚Äù to programmatically create and publish an npm package with the name ‚Äúredirect-xxxxxx,‚Äù where ‚Äúx‚Äù refers to a random alphanumeric string. The script then injects a victim‚Äôs email address and custom phishing URL into the package. Once the package is live on the npm registry, the ‚Äúmalware‚Äù proceeds to create an HTML file with a reference to the UNPKG CDN associated with the newly published package (e.g., ‚Äúunpkg[.]com/redirect-xs13nr@1.0.0/beamglea.js‚Äù).</p>

<p>The threat actor is said to be taking advantage of this behavior to distribute HTML payloads that, when opened, load JavaScript from the UNPKG CDN and redirect the victim to Microsoft credential harvesting pages. The JavaScript file ‚Äúbeamglea.js‚Äù is a redirect script that includes the victim‚Äôs email address and the URL to which the victim is navigated in order to capture their credentials. Socket said it found more than 630 HTML files in the packages‚Äô output folder that masquerade as purchase orders, technical specifications, or project documents. In other words, the npm packages are not designed to execute malicious code upon installation.</p>

<p>Instead, the campaign leverages npm and UNPKG for hosting the phishing infrastructure. It‚Äôs currently not clear how the HTML files are distributed, although it‚Äôs possible they are propagated via emails that trick recipients into launching the specially crafted HTML files. ‚ÄúWhen victims open these HTML files in a browser, the JavaScript immediately redirects to the phishing domain while passing the victim‚Äôs email address via URL fragment,‚Äù Socket said. ‚ÄúThe phishing page then pre-fills the email field, creating a convincing appearance that the victim is accessing a legitimate login portal that already recognizes them.</p>

<p>This pre-filled credential significantly increases the attack‚Äôs success rate by reducing victim suspicion.‚Äù
The findings once again highlight the ever-evolving nature of threat actors who are constantly adapting their techniques to stay ahead of defenders, who are also constantly developing new techniques to detect them. In this case, it underscores the abuse of legitimate infrastructure at scale. ‚ÄúThe npm ecosystem becomes unwitting infrastructure rather than a direct attack vector,‚Äù Pandya said. ‚ÄúDevelopers who install these packages see no malicious behavior, but victims opening specially crafted HTML files are redirected to phishing sites.‚Äù
‚ÄúBy publishing 175 packages across 9 accounts and automating victim-specific HTML generation, the attackers created a resilient phishing infrastructure that costs nothing to host and leverages trusted CDN services.</p>

<p>The combination of npm‚Äôs open registry, unpkg.com‚Äôs automatic serving, and minimal code creates a reproducible playbook that other threat actors will adopt.‚Äù

<h2 id="from-lfi-to-rce-active-exploitation-detected-in-gladinet-and-triofox-vulnerability"><a id="article-9"></a>From LFI to RCE: Active Exploitation Detected in Gladinet and TrioFox Vulnerability</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity company Huntress
said
it has observed active in-the-wild exploitation of an unpatched security flaw impacting
Gladinet CentreStack
and
TrioFox
products. The zero-day vulnerability, tracked as
CVE-2025-11371
(CVSS score: 6.1), is an unauthenticated
local file inclusion
bug that allows unintended disclosure of system files. It impacts all versions of the software prior to and including 16.7.10368.56560. Huntress said it first detected the activity on September 27, 2025, uncovering that three of its customers have been impacted so far.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs worth noting that both applications were previously affected by
CVE-2025-30406
(CVSS score: 9.0), a case of
hard-coded machine key
that could allow a threat actor to perform remote code execution via a ViewState deserialization vulnerability. The vulnerability has since come under active exploitation. CVE-2025-11371, per Huntress, ‚Äúallowed a threat actor to retrieve the machine key from the application Web.config file to perform remote code execution via the aforementioned ViewState deserialization vulnerability. Additional details of the flaw are being withheld in light of active exploration and in the absence of a patch.</p>

<p>In one instance investigated by the company, the affected version was newer than 16.4.10315.56368 and not vulnerable to CVE-2025-30406, suggesting that attackers are exploiting the new flaw to extract the hard-coded machine key and use it to execute code remotely via the ViewState deserialization flaw. In the interim, users are recommended to disable the ‚Äútemp‚Äù handler within the Web.config file for UploadDownloadProxy located at ‚ÄúC:\Program Files (x86)\Gladinet Cloud Enterprise\UploadDownloadProxy\Web.config.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis will impact some functionality of the platform; however, it will ensure that this vulnerability cannot be exploited until it is patched,‚Äù Huntress researchers Bryan Masters, James Maclachlan, Jai Minton, and John Hammond said. Huntress told The Hacker News that it has observed a ‚Äúhandful of incidents‚Äù that led to a confirmed compromise as a result of CVE-2025-11371. The activity has not been attributed to any threat actor, although the possibility that the sets of attacks could be the work of the same group has not been ruled out.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unclear if these are the same threat actors, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised since they would have already been familiar with this particular piece of software and they could have found this new vulnerability with minimal effort,‚Äù Jamie Levy, director of adversary tactics at Huntress, said. (The story was updated after publication to include a response from Huntress.)

<h2 id="cl0p-linked-hackers-breach-dozens-of-organizations-through-oracle-software-flaw"><a id="article-10"></a>CL0P-Linked Hackers Breach Dozens of Organizations Through Oracle Software Flaw</h2>

<p>Dozens of organizations may have been impacted following the zero-day exploitation of a security flaw in Oracle‚Äôs E-Business Suite (EBS) software
since August 9, 2025
, Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) and Mandiant said in a new report released Thursday. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still assessing the
scope of this incident
, but we believe it affected dozens of organizations,‚Äù John Hultquist, chief analyst of GTIG at Google Cloud, said in a statement shared with The Hacker News. ‚ÄúSome historic Cl0p data extortion campaigns have had hundreds of victims. Unfortunately, large-scale zero-day campaigns like this are becoming a regular feature of cybercrime.‚Äù
The activity, which bears some hallmarks associated with the Cl0p ransomware crew, is
assessed
to have fashioned together multiple distinct vulnerabilities, including a zero-day flaw tracked as
CVE-2025-61882
(CVSS score: 9.8), to breach target networks and exfiltrate sensitive data.</p>

<p>Google said it found evidence of additional suspicious activity dating back to July 10, 2025, although how successful these efforts were
remains unknown
. Oracle has since issued patches to address the shortcoming. Cl0p (aka Graceful Spider), active since 2020, has been attributed to the mass exploitation of several zero-days in Accellion legacy file transfer appliance (FTA), GoAnywhere MFT, Progress MOVEit MFT, and Cleo LexiCom over the years. While phishing email campaigns undertaken by the FIN11 actors have acted as a
precursor
for Cl0p ransomware deployment in the past, Google said it found signs of the file-encrypting malware being a different actor.</p>

<p>The latest wave of attacks began in earnest on September 29, 2025, when the threat actors kicked off a high-volume email campaign aimed at company executives from hundreds of compromised third-party accounts belonging to unrelated organizations. The credentials for these accounts are said to have been purchased on underground forums, presumably through the purchase of infostealer malware logs. The email messages claimed the actor had breached their Oracle EBS application and exfiltrated sensitive data, demanding that they pay an unspecified amount as ransom in return for not leaking the stolen information. To date, none of the victims of the campaign have been listed on the Cl0p data leak site ‚Äì a behavior that‚Äôs consistent with prior Cl0p attacks where the actors waited for several weeks before posting them.</p>

<p>The attacks themselves
leverage a combination
of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Carriage-Return Line-Feed (CRLF) injection, authentication bypass, and XSL template injection, to gain remote code execution on the target Oracle EBS server and set up a reverse shell. Sometime around August 2025, Google said it observed a threat actor exploiting a vulnerability in the ‚Äú/OA_HTML/SyncServlet‚Äù component to achieve remote code execution and ultimately trigger an XSL payload via the Template Preview functionality. Two different chains of Java payloads have been found embedded in the XSL payloads -
GOLDVEIN.JAVA, a Java variant of a downloader called GOLDVEIN (a PowerShell malware first detected in December 2024 in connection with the exploitation campaign of multiple Cleo software products) that can receive a second-stage payload from a command-and-control (C2) server. A Base64-encoded loader called SAGEGIFT custom designed for Oracle WebLogic servers that‚Äôs used to launch SAGELEAF, an in-memory dropper that‚Äôs then used to install SAGEWAVE, a malicious Java servlet filter that allows for the installation of an encrypted ZIP archive containing an unknown next-stage malware.</p>

<p>(The main payload, however, has some overlaps with a cli module present in a FIN11 backdoor known as GOLDTOMB.)
The threat actor has also been observed executing various reconnaissance commands from the EBS account ‚Äúapplmgr,‚Äù as well as running commands from a bash process launched from a Java process running GOLDVEIN.JAVA. Interestingly, some of the artifacts observed in July 2025 as part of incident response efforts overlap with an exploit leaked in a Telegram group named Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters on October 3, 2025. However, Google said it does not have sufficient evidence to suggest any involvement of the cybercrime crew in the campaign. The level of investment into the campaign suggests the threat actors responsible for the initial intrusion likely dedicated significant resources to pre-attack research, GTIG pointed out.</p>

<p>The tech giant said it‚Äôs not formally attributing the attack spree to a tracked threat group, although it pointed out the use of the Cl0p brand as notable. That said, it‚Äôs believed that the threat actor has an association with Cl0p. It also noted that the post-exploitation tooling exhibits overlaps with malware (i.e., GOLDVEIN and GOLDTOMB) used in a previous suspected FIN11 campaign, and that one of the breached accounts used to send the recent extortion emails was previously used by FIN11. ‚ÄúThe pattern of exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in a widely used enterprise application, followed by a large-scale, branded extortion campaign weeks later, is a hallmark of activity historically attributed to FIN11 that has strategic benefits which may also appeal to other threat actors,‚Äù it said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúTargeting public-facing applications and appliances that store sensitive data likely increases the efficiency of data theft operations, given that the threat actors do not need to dedicate time and resources to lateral movement.‚Äù

<h2 id="from-healthkick-to-govershell-the-evolution-of-uta0388s-espionage-malware"><a id="article-11"></a>From HealthKick to GOVERSHELL: The Evolution of UTA0388‚Äôs Espionage Malware</h2>

<p>A China-aligned threat actor codenamed
UTA0388
has been attributed to a series of spear-phishing campaigns targeting North America, Asia, and Europe that are designed to deliver a Go-based implant known as
GOVERSHELL
. ‚ÄúThe initially observed campaigns were tailored to the targets, and the messages purported to be sent by senior researchers and analysts from legitimate-sounding, completely fabricated organizations,‚Äù Volexity
said
in a Wednesday report. ‚ÄúThe goal of these spear phishing campaigns was to socially engineer targets into clicking links that led to a remotely hosted archive containing a malicious payload.‚Äù
Since then, the threat actor behind the attacks is said to have leveraged different lures and fictional identities, spanning several languages, including English, Chinese, Japanese, French, and German. Early iterations of the campaigns have been found to embed links to phishing content either hosted on a cloud-based service or their own infrastructure, in some cases, which led to the deployment of malware.</p>

<p>However, the follow-on waves have been described as ‚Äúhighly tailored,‚Äù in which the threat actors resort to building trust with recipients over time before sending the link ‚Äì a technique called rapport-building phishing. Irrespective of the approach used, the links lead to a ZIP or RAR archive that includes a rogue DLL payload that‚Äôs launched using DLL side-loading. The payload is an actively developed backdoor called GOVERSHELL. It‚Äôs worth noting that the activity overlaps with a cluster tracked by Proofpoint under the name
UNK_DropPitch
, with Volexity characterizing GOVERSHELL as a successor to a C++ malware family referred to as
HealthKick
.</p>

<p>As many as five distinct variants of GOVERSHELL have been identified to date -
HealthKick
(First observed in April 2025), which is equipped to run commands using cmd.exe
TE32
(First observed in June 2025), which is equipped to execute commands directly via a PowerShell reverse shell
TE64
(First observed in early July 2025), which is equipped to run native and dynamic commands using PowerShell to get system information, current system time, run command via powershell.exe, and poll an external server for new instructions
WebSocket
(First observed in mid-July 2025), which is equipped to run a PowerShell command via powershell.exe and an unimplemented ‚Äúupdate‚Äù sub-command as part of the system command
Beacon
(First observed in September 2025), which is equipped to run native and dynamic commands using PowerShell to set a base polling interval, randomize it, or execute a PowerShell command via powershell.exe
Some of the legitimate services abused to stage the archive files include Netlify, Sync, and OneDrive, whereas the email messages have been identified as sent from Proton Mail, Microsoft Outlook, and Gmail. A noteworthy aspect of UTA0388‚Äôs tradecraft is its use of OpenAI ChatGPT to generate content for phishing campaigns in English, Chinese, and Japanese; assist with malicious workflows; and search for information related to installing open-source tools like nuclei and fscan, as
revealed
by the AI company earlier this week. The ChatGPT accounts used by the threat actor have since been banned. The use of a large language model (LLM) to augment its operations is evidenced in the fabrications prevalent in the phishing emails, ranging from the personas used to send the message to the general lack of coherence in the message content itself, Volexity said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe targeting profile of the campaign is consistent with a threat actor interested in Asian geopolitical issues, with a special focus on Taiwan,‚Äù the company added. ‚ÄúThe emails and files used in this campaign leads Volexity to assess with medium confidence that UTA0388 made use of automation, LLM or otherwise, that generated and sent this content to targets with little to no human oversight in some cases.‚Äù
The disclosure comes as StrikeReady Labs
said
a suspected China-linked cyber espionage campaign has targeted a Serbian government department related to aviation, as well as other European institutions in Hungary, Belgium, Italy, and the Netherlands. The campaign, observed in late September, involves sending phishing emails containing a link that, when clicked, directs the victim to a fake Cloudflare CAPTCHA verification page that leads to the download a ZIP archive, within which there exists a Windows shortcut (LNK) file that executes PowerShell responsible for opening a decoy document and stealthily launching
PlugX
using
DLL side-loading

<h2 id="new-clayrat-spyware-targets-android-users-via-fake-whatsapp-and-tiktok-apps"><a id="article-12"></a>New ClayRat Spyware Targets Android Users via Fake WhatsApp and TikTok Apps</h2>

<p>A rapidly evolving Android spyware campaign called
ClayRat
has targeted users in Russia using a mix of Telegram channels and lookalike phishing websites by impersonating popular apps like WhatsApp, Google Photos, TikTok, and YouTube as lures to install them. ‚ÄúOnce active, the spyware can exfiltrate SMS messages, call logs, notifications, and device information; taking photos with the front camera; and even send SMS messages or place calls directly from the victim‚Äôs device,‚Äù Zimperium researcher Vishnu Pratapagiri
said
in a report shared with The Hacker News. The malware is also designed to propagate itself by sending malicious links to every contact in the victim‚Äôs phone book, indicating aggressive tactics on the part of the attackers to leverage compromised devices as a distribution vector. The mobile security company said it has detected no less than 600 samples and 50 droppers over the last 90 days, with each successive iteration incorporating new layers of obfuscation to sidestep detection efforts and stay ahead of security defenses.</p>

<p>The malware name is a reference to the command-and-control (C2) panel that can be used to remotely administer the infected devices. The attack chain involves redirecting unsuspecting visitors to these bogus sites to Telegram channels under the adversary‚Äôs control, from where they are tricked into downloading APK files by artificially inflating download counts and sharing manufactured testimonials as proof of their popularity. In other cases, bogus websites claiming to offer ‚ÄúYouTube Plus‚Äù with premium features have been found to host APK files that can bypass
security protections
enforced by Google to
prevent sideloading of apps
on devices running Android 13 and later. ‚ÄúTo bypass platform restrictions and the added friction introduced in newer Android versions, some ClayRat samples act as droppers: the visible app is merely a lightweight installer that displays a fake Play Store update screen, while the actual encrypted payload is hidden within the app‚Äôs assets,‚Äù the company said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis session-based installation method lowers perceived risk and increases the likelihood that a webpage visit will result in spyware being installed.‚Äù
Once installed, ClayRat uses standard HTTP to communicate with its C2 infrastructure and requests users to make it the default SMS application to gain access to sensitive content and messaging functions, thereby allowing it to covertly capture call logs, text messages, notifications, and disseminate the malware further to every other contact. Some of the other features of the malware include making phone calls, getting device information, taking pictures using the device camera, and sending a list of all installed applications to the C2 server. ClayRat is a potent threat not only for its surveillance capabilities, but also for its ability to turn an infected device into a distribution node in an automated fashion, which enables the threat actors to expand their reach swiftly without any manual intervention. A Google spokesperson told The Hacker News that Android users are automatically safeguarded against known versions of the malware through Google Play Protect, which is enabled by default on devices with Google Play Services.</p>

<p>The development comes as academics from the University of Luxembourg and Universit√© Cheikh Anta Diop found that pre-installed apps from budget Android smartphones sold in Africa operate with elevated privileges, with one vendor-supplied package transmitting device identifiers and location details to an external third-party. The study examined 1,544 APKs collected from seven African smartphones,
finding
that ‚Äú145 applications (9%) disclose sensitive data, 249 (16%) expose critical components without sufficient safeguards, and many present additional risks: 226 execute privileged or dangerous commands, 79 interact with SMS messages (read, send, or delete), and 33 perform silent installation operations.‚Äù

<h2 id="hackers-access-sonicwall-cloud-firewall-backups-spark-urgent-security-checks"><a id="article-13"></a>Hackers Access SonicWall Cloud Firewall Backups, Spark Urgent Security Checks</h2>

<p>SonicWall on Wednesday disclosed that an unauthorized party accessed firewall configuration backup files for all customers who have used the cloud backup service. ‚ÄúThe files contain encrypted credentials and configuration data; while encryption remains in place, possession of these files could increase the risk of targeted attacks,‚Äù the company
said
. It also noted that it‚Äôs working to notify all partners and customers, adding it has released tools to assist with device assessment and remediation. The company is also urging users to log in and check for their devices.</p>

<p>The development comes a couple of weeks after SonicWall
urged customers
to perform a credential reset after their firewall configuration backup files were exposed in a security breach impacting MySonicWall accounts. The list of impacted devices available on the MySonicWall portal has been assigned a priority level to help customers prioritize remediation efforts. The labels are as follows -
Active ‚Äì High Priority: Devices with internet-facing services enabled
Active ‚Äì Lower Priority: Devices without internet-facing services
Inactive: Devices that have not pinged home for 90 days
The latest post-mortem marks an about turn from its initial assessment when it claimed the threat actors accessed backup firewall preference files stored in the cloud for less than 5% of its customers. It also stated that while the credentials within those files were encrypted, they also included ‚Äúinformation that could make it easier for attackers to potentially exploit the related firewall.‚Äù
It‚Äôs currently not known how many of its customers use the cloud backup service.</p>

<p>SonicWall has yet to reveal when the attacks began or who is behind the activity. However, the company said it has since ‚Äúhardened‚Äù its infrastructure, applied additional logging, and introduced stronger authentication controls to prevent a repeat. Users are advised to follow the steps below with immediate effect -
Log in to MySonicWall.com account and verify if cloud backups exist for registered firewalls
If fields are blank, there is no impact
If fields contain backup details, verify whether impacted serial numbers are listed in the account
If Serial Numbers are shown, users should follow the
containment
and
remediation guidelines
for the listed firewalls
SonicWall said in cases where customers have used the Cloud Backup feature but no Serial Numbers are shown or only some of the registered Serial Numbers are displayed, it will provide additional guidance in coming days. ‚ÄúA brute-force attack was conducted against their cloud backup API service, giving the threat actor access to a treasure trove of sensitive data, including firewall rules, encrypted credentials, routing configurations and more,‚Äù Ryan Dewhurst, head of Proactive Threat Intelligence at watchTowr, told The Hacker News.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis raises questions about why the vendor didn‚Äôt implement basic protections like rate limiting and stronger controls around public APIs.‚Äù
‚ÄúAlthough the passwords were encrypted, attackers have all the time in the world to crack them offline at their leisure. If the passwords used were weak in the first place, it‚Äôs almost certain that the threat actor has the plaintext versions already. If the threat actor is unable to crack the passwords, you‚Äôre not out of the woods, as the information leaked will help in more complex targeted attacks.‚Äù

<p>Cyber threats are evolving faster than ever. Attackers now combine social engineering, AI-driven manipulation, and cloud exploitation to breach targets once considered secure. From communication platforms to connected devices, every system that enhances convenience also expands the attack surface. This edition of
ThreatsDay Bulletin
explores these converging risks and the safeguards that help preserve trust in an increasingly intelligent threat landscape.</p>

<p>How Threat Actors Abuse Microsoft Teams
Attackers Abuse Microsoft Teams for Extortion, Social Engineering, and Financial Theft
Microsoft detailed the various ways threat actors can abuse its Teams chat software at various stages of the attack chain, even using it to support financial theft through extortion, social engineering, or technical means. ‚Äú
Octo Tempest
has used communication apps, including Teams, to send taunting and threatening messages to organizations, defenders, and incident response teams as part of extortion and ransomware payment pressure tactics,‚Äù the company
said
. ‚ÄúAfter gaining control of MFA through social engineering password resets, they sign in to Teams to identify sensitive information supporting their financially motivated operations.‚Äù As mitigations, organizations are advised to strengthen identity protection, harden endpoint security, and secure Teams clients and apps. LNK Files Used in New Malware Campaign
Malicious Shortcut Files Deliver PowerShell Dropper and DLL Implant
A campaign that packages passport- or payment-themed ZIP archives with malicious Windows shortcut (.LNK) files has been found to deliver a PowerShell dropper that drops a DLL implant on compromised hosts.</p>

<p>The ZIP archives are distributed via phishing emails. ‚ÄúExecution of the staged payload launches the DLL implant with rundll32.exe using the JMB export and establishes command and control to faw3[.]com,‚Äù Blackpoint Cyber
said
. ‚ÄúThe PowerShell dropper uses simple but effective evasion, including building keywords like Start-Process and rundll32.exe from byte arrays, suppressing progress output, clearing the console, and changing server file names based on common antivirus processes. Once active, the implant runs under the user context and can enable remote tasking, host reconnaissance, and delivery of follow-on payloads while blending into normal Windows activity.‚Äù
Israel Likely Behind an AI Disinfo Campaign Targeting Iran
AI-Generated Disinformation Campaign Aimed at Destabilizing Iran
The Citizen Lab
said
a coordinated Israeli-backed network of around 50 social media accounts on X pushed anti-government propaganda using deepfakes and other AI-generated content to Iranians with the goal of fomenting revolt among the country‚Äôs people and overthrowing the Iranian regime.</p>

<p>The campaign has been codenamed PRISONBREAK. These accounts were created in 2023 but remained largely dormant until January 2025. ‚ÄúWhile organic engagement with PRISONBREAK‚Äôs content appears to be limited, some of the posts achieved tens of thousands of views. The operation seeded such posts to large public communities on X, and possibly also paid for their promotion,‚Äù the non-profit said.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs assessed that the campaign is the work of an unidentified agency of the Israeli government, or a sub-contractor working under its close supervision. Opposition to E.U. Chat Control
Signal, Tech Firms, and Officials Push Back Against E.U. Chat Control Proposal
The president of the Signal Foundation said the end-to-end encrypted messaging app will leave the European Union market rather than comply with a potential new regulation known as Chat Control.</p>

<p>Chat Control, first introduced in 2022, would require service providers, including end-to-end encrypted platforms like Signal, to scan all platform communications and files to screen for ‚Äúabusive material‚Äù before a message is sent. ‚ÄúUnder the guise of protecting children, the latest Chat Control proposals would require mass scanning of every message, photo, and video on a person‚Äôs device, assessing these via a government-mandated database or AI model to determine whether they are permissible content or not,‚Äù Signal Foundation President Meredith Whittaker
said
. ‚ÄúWhat they propose is in effect a mass surveillance free-for-all, opening up everyone‚Äôs intimate and confidential communications, whether government officials, military, investigative journalists, or activists.‚Äù
CryptPad
,
Element
, and
Tuta
are among more than 40 other E.U. tech companies that have signed an open letter against the Chat Control proposal.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, German officials
said
they will vote against the proposal, signaling that the bloc will not have the votes to move forward with the controversial measure. Autodesk Revit Crash to RCE
Crash in Autodesk Revit File Parsing Leads to Reliable Remote Code Execution
New research has found that it‚Äôs possible to turn a Autodesk Revit file parsing crash (
CVE-2025-5037
) into a code execution exploit that is fully reliable even on the latest Windows x64 platform. ‚ÄúThis RCE is unusually impactful due to the Axis cloud misconfiguration that could have resulted in automatic exploitation during normal usage of the affected products,‚Äù Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative researcher Simon Zuckerbraun
said
. France Opens Probe into Apple Siri Voice Recordings
French Authorities Investigate Apple Over Siri Voice Data Collection
France said it‚Äôs opening an investigation into Apple over the company‚Äôs collection of Siri voice recordings.</p>

<p>The Paris public prosecutor said the probe is in response to a whistleblower complaint. Apple subcontractor Thomas Le Bonniec said Siri conversations contained intimate moments or sensitive data that could easily deanonymize and identify users. ‚ÄúApple has never used Siri data to create marketing profiles, has never made it available for advertising, and has never sold it to anyone for any reason whatsoever,‚Äù the company
said
in a statement shared with Politico. Earlier this January, Apple
said
it would not keep ‚Äúaudio recordings of interactions with Siri, unless the user explicitly agrees.‚Äù
North Korea Linked to $2B Theft in 2025
North Korean-Linked Hackers Responsible for Over $2B in Crypto Thefts This Year
North Korean hackers have stolen an estimated $2 billion worth of cryptocurrency assets in 2025, marking the largest annual total on record.</p>

<p>A large chunk of the theft came from the Bybit hack in February, when the threat actors stole about $1.46 billion. Other thefts publicly attributed to North Korea in 2025 include those suffered by LND.fi, WOO X, and Seedify. However, it‚Äôs suspected that the actual figure may be even higher. ‚ÄúThe 2025 total already dwarfs previous years and is almost triple last year‚Äôs tally, underscoring the growing scale of North Korea‚Äôs dependence on cyber-enabled theft to fund its regime,‚Äù Elliptic
said
.</p>

<p>A notable shift observed this year is the increasing targeting of high-net-worth individuals. ‚ÄúAs crypto prices have risen, individuals have become increasingly attractive targets, often lacking the security measures employed by businesses,‚Äù the company added. ‚ÄúSome of these individuals are also targeted due to their association with businesses holding large amounts of cryptoassets, which the hackers are looking to steal.‚Äù The development comes as Fortune
reported
that the North Korean fraudulent IT worker scheme has funneled up to $1 billion into the regime‚Äôs nuclear program in the past five years, making it a lucrative revenue-generating stream. North Korean actors well-versed in IT have been observed stealing identities, falsifying their r√©sum√©s, and deceiving their way into highly paid remote tech jobs in the U.S., Europe, Australia, and Saudi Arabia, using artificial intelligence to fabricate work and disguise their faces and identities.</p>

<p>According to the latest statistics from Okta, one in two targets were not tech firms, and one in four targets were not U.S.-based companies, indicating that any company recruiting remote talent could be at risk. Besides a ‚Äúmarked‚Äù increase in attempts to gain employment at AI companies or AI-focused roles, other sectors prominently targeted by North Korea included finance, healthcare, public administration, and professional services. The identity services provider said it has tracked over 130 identities operated by facilitators and workers, which can be linked to over 6,500 initial job interviews across more than 5,000 distinct companies up until mid-2025. ‚ÄúYears of sustained activity against a broad range of U.S.</p>

<p>industries have allowed Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea-aligned facilitators and workers to refine their infiltration methods,‚Äù Okta
said
. ‚ÄúThey are entering new markets with a mature, well-adapted workforce capable of bypassing basic screening controls and exploiting hiring pipelines more effectively.‚Äù Once hired, North Korea IT workers request payment in stablecoins, likely due to their consistent value, as well as their popularity with OTC traders who can facilitate the
off-ramp
from cryptocurrency to fiat, Chainalysis
noted
. The salaries are then transferred through various money laundering techniques, such as chain-hopping, token swapping, bridge protocols, and consolidation addresses, to complicate the tracing of funds. Security Flaws in YoLink Smart Hub
YoLink Smart Hub Flaws Allow Remote Control, Credential Exposure
Security vulnerabilities have been
discovered
in the YoLink Smart Hub (v0382), the gateway device that manages all YoLink locks, sensors, plugs, and other IoT products, which could be exploited to achieve authorization bypass and allow attackers to remotely control other users‚Äô devices, and access Wi-Fi credentials and device IDs in plaintext.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, the use of long-lived session tokens allows ongoing unauthorized access. The
vulnerabilities
relate to insufficient authorization controls (CVE-2025-59449 and CVE-2025-59452), insecure network transmission (CVE-2025-59448), and improper session management (CVE-2025-59451). The most severe vulnerability, CVE-2025-59449, is rated as critical and could allow an attacker who obtains predictable device IDs to operate a user‚Äôs devices without strong authentication. The unencrypted MQTT communication between the hub and the mobile app also allows for the exposure of sensitive data like credentials and device IDs.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAn attacker [‚Ä¶] could potentially obtain physical access to YoLink customers‚Äô homes by opening their garages or unlocking their doors,‚Äù Bishop Fox researcher Nicholas Cerne said. ‚ÄúAlternatively, the attacker could toggle the power state of devices connected to YoLink smart plugs, which could have a variety of impacts depending on the types of devices that were connected.‚Äù
Authentication Bypass in Tesla TCU
ADB Lockdown Bypass in Tesla Telematics Control Unit Could Lead to Root Code Execution
Cybersecurity researchers from NCC Group
detailed
a bypass of the Android debug bridge (ADB) lockdown logic in Tesla‚Äôs telematics control unit (TCU) that could potentially allow attackers to gain shell access to production devices. The flaw (CVE-2025-34251, CVSS score: 8.6) is an arbitrary file write that could be used to obtain code execution in the context of root on the TCU. ‚ÄúThe TCU runs the Android Debug Bridge (adbd) as root and, despite a ‚Äòlockdown‚Äô check that disables adb shell, still permits adb push/pull and adb forward,‚Äù according to an
advisory
for the vulnerability.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBecause adbd is privileged and the device‚Äôs USB port is exposed externally, an attacker with physical access can write an arbitrary file to a writable location and then overwrite the kernel‚Äôs uevent_helper or /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug entries via ADB, causing the script to be executed with root privileges.‚Äù
Spoofed Domains Deliver Android and Windows Malware
Threat Actors Use Spoofed Sites to Deliver Android &amp; Windows Trojans
A financially motivated threat cluster has used more than 80 spoofed domains and lure websites to target users with fake applications and websites themed as government tax sites, consumer banking, age 18+ social media content, and Windows assistant applications, DomainTools
said
. The end goal of the attacks is to deliver Android and Windows trojans, likely for the purpose of stealing credentials through the use of fake login pages. The presence of Meta tracking pixels indicates that the threat actors are likely running it as a campaign, using Facebook ads or other methods to drive traffic to the fake pages. NoName057(16) Bounces Back
NoName057(16) Resurges After Operation Eastwood Disruption
The hacktivist group known as NoName057(16), which suffered a
significant blow
in July 2025 following an international law enforcement effort called Operation Eastwood, has managed to bounce back, escalate its activities, and leverage new alliances to amplify its reach.</p>

<p>A majority of the group‚Äôs targets between late July and August 2025 comprised German websites, focusing on municipalities, police, public services, and government portals, as well as sites in Spain, Belgium, and Italy. ‚ÄúA key limitation remains: the group‚Äôs core infrastructure and leadership are based in Russia,‚Äù Imperva
said
. ‚ÄúWithout cooperation from Russian authorities, fully dismantling NoName057(16) is highly unlikely. To date, Moscow has not taken action against pro-Russian hacktivist groups, and their activities often continue without interference.‚Äù
LATAM Banks Targeted by BlackStink
Chrome Extension Malware Steals Funds from Latin American Banks
Financial institutions in Latin America have become the target of a new malware campaign that uses malicious Google Chrome extensions mimicking Google Docs to initiate fraudulent transfers in real-time by taking remote control of the banking session.</p>

<p>The activity, dubbed BlackStink, leverages advanced WebInject techniques to bypass traditional detection mechanisms, per IBM X-Force. ‚ÄúOnce active, it can dynamically inject deceptive overlays into legitimate banking pages to harvest credentials, account details and transaction data,‚Äù the company
noted
. ‚ÄúBeyond simple credential theft, BlackStink is capable of auto-filling and auto-submitting forms, simulating user actions and executing automatic transactions ‚Äì allowing attackers to move funds in real time without the victim‚Äôs awareness.‚Äù
Over 2K Oracle E-Business Suite Instances Exposed to Internet
Thousands of Oracle E-Business Suite Instances Exposed ‚Äî Patch CVE-2025-61882
Attack surface management company Censys
said
it observed 2,043 internet-accessible Oracle E-Business Suite instances exposed to the internet, making it crucial that users take steps to secure against
CVE-2025-61882
, a critical vulnerability in the Concurrent Processing component that can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise the system. The vulnerability is assessed to have been weaponized as a zero-day by Cl0p as part of new extortion attacks since August 2025.</p>

<p>Asgard Protector Detailed
Asgard Protector Crypter Used to Evade Detection and Deliver Stealers
A crypter service called Asgard Protector is being used to hide malicious payloads such as Lumma Stealer to help the artifacts bypass security defenses. ‚ÄúAsgard Protector leverages Nullsoft package installations, hidden AutoIt binaries, and compiled AutoIt scripts in order to inject encrypted payloads into memory, which are decrypted in memory and executed,‚Äù SpyCloud
said
. ‚ÄúThe combination of LummaC2 and Asgard Protector represents a potent union for evading detection and stealing data from devices and networks.‚Äù Some of the other malware families distributed using this crypter are Quasar RAT, Rhadamanthys, Vidar, and ACR Stealer. There is evidence to suggest that Asgard Protector has some sort of a connection with CypherIT given the functional similarities between the two.</p>

<p>Updates to WARMCOOKIE Malware
WARMCOOKIE (BadSpace) Continues Development; CastleBot Used for Propagation
The Windows malware known as
WARMCOOKIE
(aka BadSpace) is being actively developed and distributed, with recent campaigns leveraging
CastleBot
for propagation. ‚ÄúThe most recent WARMCOOKIE builds we have collected contain the DLL/EXE execution functionality, with PowerShell script functionality being much less prevalent,‚Äù Elastic
said
. ‚ÄúThese capabilities leverage the same function by passing different arguments for each file type. The handler creates a folder in a temporary directory, writing the file content (EXE / DLL / PS1) to a temporary file in the newly created folder.</p>

<p>Then, it executes the temporary file directly or uses either rundll32.exe or PowerShell.exe. Below is an example of PE execution from procmon.‚Äù
Mic-E-Mouse Attack for Covert Data Exfiltration
Optical Mouse Turned Into Microphone for Air-Gapped Data Theft
Academics from UC Irvine have developed a new technique that turns an optical mouse into a microphone to secretly record and exfiltrate data from air-gapped networks. The new Mic-E-Mouse technique takes advantage of the high-performance optical sensors common in gaming mice to detect tiny vibrations caused by nearby sound and record the pattern in mouse movements. This data is then collected and exfiltrated to recover conversations with the help of a transformer-based neural network.</p>

<p>For the attack to work, a bad actor must first compromise the computer through other means. The study used a $35 mouse to test the system and found it could capture speech with 61% accuracy, depending on voice frequency. ‚ÄúOur target for a suitable exploit delivery vehicle is open-source applications where the collection and distribution of high-frequency mouse data is not inherently suspicious,‚Äù the researchers
said
. ‚ÄúTherefore, creative software, video games, and other high performance, low latency software are an [sic] ideal targets for injecting our exploit.‚Äù
Crimson Collective Targets AWS Environments
Crimson Collective Linked to Red Hat Breach and AWS Data Theft
The emerging threat group known as
Crimson Collective
, which has been attributed to the recent breach of Red Hat, is believed to share ties with the larger Scattered Spider and LAPSUS$ collectives, according to security researcher
Kevin Beaumont
.</p>

<p>The assessment is based on the fact that the messages posted on the group‚Äôs public Telegram channel are signed with the name ‚ÄúMiku,‚Äù which refers to an alias for Thalha Jubair, who was
arrested
last month in the U.K. in connection with the August 2024 cyber attack targeting Transport for London (TfL), the city‚Äôs public transportation agency. Interestingly, the Red Hat compromise date is listed as September 13, 2025, a couple of days before Jubair‚Äôs arrest. According to Rapid7, the threat actors are increasingly targeting AWS cloud environments to steal sensitive data and extort victim organizations, with the attacks relying on an open-source tool called TruffleHog to find leaked AWS credentials.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe threat group‚Äôs activity has been observed to start with compromising long-term access keys and leveraging privileges attached to the compromised IAM (Identity &amp; Access Management) accounts,‚Äù the company
said
. ‚ÄúThe threat group was observed creating new users and escalating privileges by attaching policies. When successful, the Crimson Collective performed reconnaissance to identify valuable data and exfiltrated it via AWS services. In case of the successful exfiltration of data, an extortion note is received by the victim.‚Äù The group has since partnered with Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters, with ShinyHunters
telling
Bleeping Computer that it has been privately operating as an extortion-as-a-service (EaaS), where they work with other threat actors to extort companies in exchange for a share of the extortion demand.</p>

<p>Defending against modern threats requires more than tools ‚Äî it demands awareness, adaptability, and shared responsibility. As attackers evolve, so must our approach to security. The path forward lies in continuous learning, stronger collaboration, and smarter use of technology to keep trust intact in a connected world. Found this article interesting?</p>
