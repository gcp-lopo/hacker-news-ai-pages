<h2 id="dprk-operatives-impersonate-professionals-on-linkedin-to-infiltrate-companies"><a id="article-1"></a>DPRK Operatives Impersonate Professionals on LinkedIn to Infiltrate Companies</h2>

<p>The information technology (IT) workers associated with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) are now applying to remote positions using real LinkedIn accounts of individuals they’re impersonating, marking a new escalation of the fraudulent scheme. “These profiles often have verified workplace emails and identity badges, which DPRK operatives hope will make their fraudulent applications appear legitimate,” Security Alliance (SEAL)
said
in a series of posts on X. The
IT worker threat
is a
long-running operation
mounted by North Korea in which operatives from the country pose as remote workers to secure jobs in Western companies and elsewhere under stolen or fabricated identities. The threat is also tracked by the broader cybersecurity community as Jasper Sleet, PurpleDelta, and Wagemole.</p>

<p>The end goal of these efforts is two-pronged: to generate a steady revenue stream to fund the nation’s weapons programs, conduct espionage by stealing sensitive data, and, in some cases, take it further by
demanding ransoms
to avoid leaking the information. Last month, cybersecurity company Silent Push
described
the DPRK remote worker program as a “high-volume revenue engine” for the regime, enabling the threat actors to also gain administrative access to sensitive codebases and establish living-off-the-land persistence within corporate infrastructure. “Once their salaries are paid, DPRK IT workers transfer cryptocurrency through a variety of different money laundering techniques,” blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis
noted
in a report published in October 2025. “One of the ways in which IT workers, as well as their money laundering counterparts, break the link between source and destination of funds on-chain, is through chain-hopping and/or token swapping.</p>

<p>They leverage smart contracts such as decentralized exchanges and bridge protocols to complicate the tracing of funds.”
To counter the threat, individuals who suspect their identities are being misappropriated in fraudulent job applications are advised to consider posting a warning on their social media accounts, along with listing their official communication channels and the verification method to contact them (e.g., company email). “Always validate that accounts listed by candidates are controlled by the email they provide,” Security Alliance said. “Simple checks like asking them to connect with you on LinkedIn will verify their ownership and control of the account.”
The disclosure comes as the Norwegian Police Security Service (PST) issued an advisory, stating it’s aware of “several cases” over the past year where Norwegian businesses have been impacted by IT worker schemes. “The businesses have been tricked into hiring what likely North Korean IT workers in home office positions,” PST
said
last week.</p>

<p>“The salary income North Korean employees receive through such positions probably goes to finance the country’s weapons and nuclear weapons program.”
Running parallel to the IT worker scheme is another social engineering campaign dubbed
Contagious Interview
that involves using fake hiring flows to lure prospective targets into interviews after approaching them on LinkedIn with job offers. The malicious phase of the attack kicks in when individuals presenting themselves as recruiters and hiring managers instruct targets to complete a skill assessment that eventually leads to them executing malicious code. In one case of a recruiting impersonation campaign targeting tech workers using a hiring process resembling that of digital asset infrastructure company Fireblocks, the threat actors are said to have asked candidates to clone a GitHub repository and run commands to install an npm package to trigger malware execution. “The campaign also employed EtherHiding, a novel technique that leverages blockchain smart contracts to host and retrieve command-and-control infrastructure, making the malicious payload more resilient to takedowns,” security researcher Ori Hershko
said
.</p>

<p>“These steps triggered the execution of malicious code hidden within the project. Running the setup process resulted in malware being downloaded and executed on the victim’s system, giving the attackers a foothold in the victim’s machine.”
In recent months, new variants of the Contagious Interview campaign have been observed using malicious Microsoft VS Code task files to execute JavaScript malware disguised as web fonts that ultimately lead to the deployment of BeaverTail and InvisibleFerret, allowing persistent access and theft of cryptocurrency wallets and browser credentials, per reports from
Abstract Security
and
OpenSourceMalware
. Koalemos RAT campaign
Another variant of the intrusion set documented by Panther is suspected to involve the use of malicious npm packages to deploy a modular JavaScript remote access trojan (RAT) framework dubbed Koalemos via a loader. The RAT is designed to enter a beacon loop to retrieve tasks from an external server, execute them, send encrypted responses, and sleep for a random time interval before repeating again.</p>

<p>It supports 12 different commands to conduct filesystem operations, transfer files, run discovery instructions (e.g., whoami), and execute arbitrary code. The names of some of the packages associated with the activity are as follows -
env-workflow-test
sra-test-test
sra-testing-test
vg-medallia-digital
vg-ccc-client
vg-dev-env
“The initial loader performs DNS-based execution gating and engagement date validation before downloading and spawning the RAT module as a detached process,” security researcher Alessandra Rizzo
said
. “Koalemos performs system fingerprinting, establishes encrypted command-and-control communications, and provides full remote access capabilities.”
Labyrinth Chollima Segments into Specialized Operational Units
The development comes as CrowdStrike
revealed
that the prolific North Korean hacking crew known as Labyrinth Chollima has evolved into three separate clusters with distinct objectives and tradecraft: the core Labyrinth Chollima group, Golden Chollima (aka AppleJeus, Citrine Sleet, and UNC4736), and Pressure Chollima (aka Jade Sleet, TraderTraitor, and UNC4899). It’s worth noting that Labyrinth Chollima, along with Andariel and BlueNoroff, are considered to be sub-clusters within the Lazarus Group (aka Diamond Sleet and Hidden Cobra), with BlueNoroff splintering into
TraderTraitor and CryptoCore
(aka Sapphire Sleet), according to an assessment from DTEX.</p>

<p>Despite the newfound independence, these adversaries continue to share tools and infrastructure, suggesting centralized coordination and resource allocation within the DPRK cyber apparatus. Golden Chollima focuses on consistent, smaller-scale cryptocurrency thefts in economically developed regions, whereas Pressure Chollima pursues high-value heists with advanced implants to single out organizations with significant digital asset holdings. New North Korea Clusters
On the other hand, Labyrinth Chollima’s operations are motivated by cyber espionage, using tools like the
FudModule
rootkit to achieve stealth. The latter is also attributed to
Operation Dream Job
, another job-centred social engineering campaign designed to deliver malware for intelligence gathering.</p>

<p>“Shared infrastructure elements and tool cross-pollination indicate these units maintain close coordination,” CrowdStrike said. “All three adversaries employ remarkably similar tradecraft – including supply chain compromises, HR-themed social engineering campaigns, trojanized legitimate software, and malicious Node.js and Python packages.”

<h2 id="reynolds-ransomware-embeds-byovd-driver-to-disable-edr-security-tools"><a id="article-2"></a>Reynolds Ransomware Embeds BYOVD Driver to Disable EDR Security Tools</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of an emergent ransomware family dubbed
Reynolds
that comes embedded with a built-in bring your own vulnerable driver (BYOVD) component for defense evasion purposes within the ransomware payload itself. BYOVD refers to an
adversarial technique
that abuses legitimate but flawed driver software to escalate privileges and disable Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions so that malicious activities go unnoticed. The strategy has been
adopted
by
many ransomware groups
over the years. “Normally, the BYOVD defense evasion component of an attack would involve a distinct tool that would be deployed on the system prior to the ransomware payload in order to disable security software,” the Symantec and Carbon Black Threat Hunter Team
said
in a report shared with The Hacker News.</p>

<p>“However, in this attack, the vulnerable driver (an NsecSoft NSecKrnl driver) was bundled with the ransomware itself.”
Broadcom’s cybersecurity teams noted that this tactic of bundling a defense evasion component within the ransomware payload is not novel, and that it has been observed in a
Ryuk ransomware attack in 2020
and in an incident involving a lesser-known ransomware family called
Obscura
in late August 2025. In the Reynolds campaign, the ransomware is designed to drop a vulnerable NsecSoft NSecKrnl driver and terminate processes associated with various security programs from Avast, CrowdStrike Falcon, Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR, Sophos (along with HitmanPro.Alert), and Symantec Endpoint Protection, among others. It’s worth noting that the NSecKrnl driver is susceptible to a known security flaw (
CVE-2025-68947
, CVSS score: 5.7) that could be exploited to terminate arbitrary processes. Notably, the driver has been
put to use
by a threat actor known as Silver Fox in attacks designed to kill endpoint security tools prior to delivering
ValleyRAT
.</p>

<p>Over the past year, the hacking group has previously wielded multiple legitimate but flawed drivers – including
truesight.sys
and
amsdk.sys
– as part of BYOVD attacks to disarm security programs. By bringing together defense evasion and ransomware capabilities into one component, it makes it harder for defenders to stop the attack, not to mention obviating the need for an affiliate to separately incorporate this step into their modus operandi. “Also of note in this attack campaign was the presence of a suspicious side-loaded loader on the target’s network several weeks prior to the ransomware being deployed,” Symantec and Carbon Black said. “Also of note in this attack campaign was the presence of a suspicious side-loaded loader on the target’s network several weeks prior to the ransomware being deployed.”
Another tool deployed on the target network a day after the ransomware deployment was the GotoHTTP remote access program, indicating that the attackers may be looking to maintain persistent access to the compromised hosts.</p>

<p>“BYOVD is popular with attackers due to its effectiveness and reliance on legitimate, signed files, which are less likely to raise red flags,” the company said. “The advantages of wrapping the defense evasion capability in with the ransomware payload, and the reason ransomware actors might do this, may include the fact that packaging the defense evasion binary and the ransomware payload together is “quieter”, with no separate external file dropped on the victim network.”
The finding coincides with various ransomware-related developments in recent weeks -
A
high-volume phishing campaign
has used emails with Windows shortcut (LNK) attachments to run PowerShell code that fetches a
Phorpiex
dropper, which is then used to deliver the
GLOBAL GROUP
ransomware. The ransomware is notable for carrying out all activity locally on the compromised system, making it compatible with air‑gapped environments. It also conducts no data exfiltration.</p>

<p>Attacks mounted by
WantToCry
have
abused
virtual machines (VMs) provisioned by ISPsystem, a legitimate virtual infrastructure management provider, to host and deliver malicious payloads at scale. Some of the hostnames have been identified in the infrastructure of multiple ransomware operators, including LockBit, Qilin, Conti, BlackCat, and Ursnif, as well as various malware campaigns involving NetSupport RAT, PureRAT, Lampion, Lumma Stealer, and RedLine Stealer. It’s assessed that bulletproof hosting providers are leasing ISPsystem virtual machines to other criminal actors for use in ransomware operations and malware delivery by exploiting a design weakness in VMmanager’s default Windows templates that reuse the same static hostname and system identifiers every time they are deployed. This, in turn, allows threat actors to set up thousands of VMs with the same hostname and complicate takedown efforts.</p>

<p>DragonForce
has created a “Company Data Audit” service to support affiliates during
extortion campaigns
as part of the continued professionalization of ransomware operations. “The audit includes a detailed risk report, prepared communication materials, such as call scripts and executive-level letters, and strategic guidance designed to influence negotiations,” LevelBlue
said
. DragonForce operates as a cartel that allows affiliates to create their own brands while operating under its umbrella and gaining access to its resources and services. The latest iteration of LockBit,
LockBit 5.0
, has been
found
to use ChaCha20 to encrypt files and data across
Windows
,
Linux
, and
ESXi
environments, a shift from the AES-based encryption approach in LockBit 2.0 and LockBit 3.0.</p>

<p>In addition, the new version features a wiper component, an option to delay execution prior to encryption, track status of encryption using a progress bar, improved anti-analysis techniques to evade detection, and enhanced in-memory execution to minimize disk traces. The
Interlock ransomware group
has continued its assault on U.K.- and U.S.-based organizations, particularly in the education sector, in one case
leveraging
a zero-day vulnerability in the “GameDriverx64.sys” gaming anti-cheat driver (
CVE-2025-61155
, CVSS score: 5.5) to disable security tools in a BYOVD attack. The attack is also characterized by the deployment of NodeSnake/Interlock RAT (aka
CORNFLAKE
) to steal sensitive data, while initial access is said to have originated from a
MintLoader
infection. Ransomware operators have been
observed
increasingly shifting their focus from traditional on-premises targets to cloud storage services, especially misconfigured S3 buckets used by Amazon Web Services (AWS), with the attacks leaning on native cloud features to delete or overwrite data, suspend access, or extract sensitive content, while simultaneously staying under the radar.</p>

<p>According to data from Cyble, GLOBAL GROUP is
one of the many ransomware crews
that sprang forth in 2025, the others being Devman, DireWolf, NOVA, J group, Warlock, BEAST, Sinobi, NightSpire, and The Gentlemen. In Q4 2025 alone, Sinobi’s data leak site listings increased 306%, making it the third-most active ransomware group after Qilin and Akira, per ReliaQuest. “Meanwhile, the return of LockBit 5.0 was one of Q4’s biggest shifts, driven by a late-quarter spike that saw the group list 110 organizations in December alone,” researcher Gautham Ashok
said
. “This output signals a group that can scale execution quickly, convert intrusions into impact, and sustain an affiliate pipeline capable of operating at volume.”
The emergence of new players, combined with partnerships forged between existing groups, has led to a spike in ransomware activity.</p>

<p>Ransomware actors
claimed
a total of 4,737 attacks during 2025, up from 4,701 in 2024. The number of attacks that don’t involve encryption and instead rely purely on data theft as a means to exert pressure reached 6,182 during the same period, a 23% increase from 2024. As for the average ransom payment, the figure stood at $591,988 in Q4 2025, a 57% jump from Q3 2025, driven by a small number of “outsized settlements,” Coveware
said
in its quarterly report last week, adding threat actors may return to their “data encryption roots” for more effective leverage to extract ransoms from victims. Found this article interesting?</p>

<h2 id="from-ransomware-to-residency-inside-the-rise-of-the-digital-parasite"><a id="article-3"></a>From Ransomware to Residency: Inside the Rise of the Digital Parasite</h2>

<p>Are ransomware and encryption still the defining signals of modern cyberattacks, or has the industry been too fixated on noise while missing a more dangerous shift happening quietly all around them? According to Picus Labs’ new
Red Report 2026,
which analyzed over 1.1 million malicious files and mapped 15.5 million adversarial actions observed across 2025, attackers are no longer optimizing for disruption. Instead, their goal is now long-term, invisible access. To be clear, ransomware isn’t going anywhere, and adversaries continue to innovate.</p>

<p>But the data shows a clear strategic pivot away from loud, destructive attacks toward techniques designed to evade detection, persist inside environments, and quietly exploit identity and trusted infrastructure. Rather than breaking in and burning systems down, today’s attackers increasingly behave like Digital Parasites. They live inside the host, feed on credentials and services, and remain undetected for as long as possible. Public attention often gravitates toward dramatic outages and visible impact.</p>

<p>The data in this year’s Red Report tells a quieter story, one that reveals where defenders are actually losing visibility. The Ransomware Signal Is Fading
For the past decade, ransomware encryption served as the clearest signal of cyber risk. When your systems locked up and your operations froze, compromise was undeniable. That signal is now losing relevance.</p>

<p>Year over year,
Data Encrypted for Impact (T1486)
dropped by 38%, declining from 21.00% in 2024 to 12.94% in 2025. This decline doesn’t show reduced attacker capability. It reflects a deliberate shift in strategy instead. Rather than locking data to force payment, threat actors are shifting toward data extortion as their primary monetization model.</p>

<p>By avoiding encryption, attackers keep systems operational while they:
Quietly exfiltrate sensitive data
Harvest credentials and tokens
Remain embedded in environments for extended periods
Apply pressure later through extortion rather than disruption
The implication is clear: impact is no longer defined by locked systems, but by how long attackers can maintain access within a host’s systems without being detected. “The adversary’s business model has shifted from immediate disruption to long-lived access.”
– Picus Red Report 2026
Credential Theft Becomes the Control Plane (A Quarter of Attacks)
As attackers shift toward prolonged, stealthy persistence, identity becomes the most reliable path to control. The Red Report 2026
shows that
Credentials from Password Stores (T1555)
appear in nearly one out of every four attacks (23.49%), making credential theft one of the most prevalent behaviors observed over the last year. Rather than relying on noisy credential dumping or complex exploit chains, attackers are increasingly extracting saved credentials directly from browsers, keychains, and password managers.</p>

<p>Once they have valid credentials, privilege escalation and lateral movement are usually just a little native administrative tooling away. More and more modern malware campaigns are behaving like digital parasites. There are no alarms, no crashes, and no obvious indicators. Just an eerie quiet.</p>

<p>This same logic now shapes attacker tradecraft more broadly. 80% of Top ATT&amp;CK Techniques Now Favor Stealth
Despite the breadth of the
MITRE ATT&amp;CK® framework
, real-world malware activity continues to concentrate around a small set of techniques that are increasingly prioritizing evasion and persistence. The Red Report 2026 reveals a stark imbalance: Eight of the Top Ten MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques are now primarily dedicated to evasion, persistence, or stealthy command-and-control. This represents the highest concentration of stealth-focused tradecraft Picus Labs has ever recorded, signaling a fundamental shift in attacker success metrics.</p>

<p>Rather than prioritizing immediate impact, modern adversaries are optimizing for maximum dwell time. Techniques that enable attackers to hide, blend in, and remain operational for extended periods now outweigh those designed for disruption. Here are some of the most commonly observed behaviors from this year’s report:
T1055 –
Process Injection
allows malware to run inside trusted system processes, making malicious activity difficult to distinguish from legitimate execution. T1547 –
Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
ensures persistence by surviving reboots and user logins.</p>

<p>T1071 –
Application Layer Protocols
provide “whisper channels” for command-and-control, blending attacker traffic into normal web and cloud communications. T1497 –
Virtualization and Sandbox Evasion
enables malware to detect analysis environments and refuse to execute when it suspects it is being observed. The combined effect is powerful. Legitimate-looking processes use legitimate tools to quietly operate over widely trusted channels.</p>

<p>Signature-based detection struggles in this environment, while behavioral analysis becomes increasingly important for identifying illicit activity deliberately designed to appear normal. Where encryption once defined the attack, stealth now defines its success. Self-Aware Malware Refuses to Be Analyzed
When stealth becomes the primary measure of success, evading detection alone is no longer enough. Attackers must also avoid triggering the tools defenders rely on to observe their malicious behavior in the first place.</p>

<p>The Red Report 2026 shows this clearly in the rise of Virtualization and Sandbox Evasion (T1497), which moved into the top tier of attacker tradecraft in 2025. Modern malware increasingly evaluates
where
it is before deciding
whether
to act. Instead of relying on simple artifact checks, some samples assess execution context and user interaction to determine if they’re actually operating in a real environment. In one example highlighted in the report,
LummaC2
analyzed mouse movement patterns using geometry, calculating Euclidean distance and cursor angles to distinguish human interaction from the linear motion typical of automated sandbox environments.</p>

<p>When conditions appeared artificial, it deliberately suppressed any execution and just sat there, quietly biding its time. This behavior reflects a deeper shift in attacker logic. Malware can no longer be relied on to reveal itself in sandbox environments. It withholds activity by design, remaining dormant until it reaches a real production system.</p>

<p>In an ecosystem dominated by stealth and persistence,
inaction itself
has become a core evasion technique. AI Hype vs. Reality: Evolution, Not Revolution
With attackers demonstrating increasingly adaptive behavior, it’s natural to ask
where artificial intelligence fits into this picture
. The Red Report 2026 data suggests a measured answer.</p>

<p>Despite widespread speculation, almost
anticipation,
about AI reshaping the malware landscape, Picus Labs observed no meaningful increase in AI-driven malware techniques across the 2025 dataset. Instead, the most prevalent behaviors remain familiar. Longstanding techniques such as Process Injection and Command and Scripting Interpreter continue to dominate real-world intrusions, reinforcing that attackers do not require advanced AI to bypass modern defenses. Some malware families have begun experimenting with large language model APIs, but so far their use has remained limited in scope.</p>

<p>In observed cases, LLM services were primarily used to retrieve predefined commands or act as a convenient communication layer. These implementations improve efficiency, but they’re not fundamentally altering attacker decision-making or execution logic. So far, the data shows that AI is being
absorbed into
existing tradecraft rather than
redefining it
. The mechanics of the Digital Parasite remain unchanged: credential theft, stealthy persistence, abuse of trusted processes, and longer and longer dwell times.</p>

<p>Attackers are not winning by inventing radically new techniques. They’re winning by becoming quieter, more patient, and increasingly hard to distinguish from legitimate activity. Back to Basics for a Different Threat Model
Having run these reports annually for some time now, we see a continuing trend with many of the same tactics appearing year after year. What has fundamentally changed is the objective.</p>

<p>Modern attacks prioritize:
remaining invisible
abusing trusted identities and tools
disabling defenses quietly
maintaining access over time
By doubling down on modern security fundamentals, behavior-based detection, credential hygiene, and
continuous Adversarial Exposure Validation
, organizations can focus less on dramatic attack scenarios and more on the threats that are actually succeeding today. Ready to Validate Against the Digital Parasite? While ransomware headlines still dominate the news cycle, the Red Report 2026 shows that, more and more, the real risk lies in silent, persistent compromise. Picus Security focuses on validating defenses against the specific techniques attackers are using right now, not just the ones making the most noise.</p>

<h2 id="fortinet-patches-critical-sqli-flaw-enabling-unauthenticated-code-execution"><a id="article-5"></a>Fortinet Patches Critical SQLi Flaw Enabling Unauthenticated Code Execution</h2>

<p>Fortinet has released security updates to address a critical flaw impacting FortiClientEMS that could lead to the execution of arbitrary code on susceptible systems. The vulnerability, tracked as
CVE-2026-21643
, has a CVSS rating of 9.1 out of a maximum of 10.0. “An improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL Command (‘SQL Injection’) vulnerability [CWE-89] in FortiClientEMS may allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute unauthorized code or commands via specifically crafted HTTP requests,” Fortinet
said
in an advisory. The shortcoming affects the following versions -
FortiClientEMS 7.2 (Not affected)
FortiClientEMS 7.4.4 (Upgrade to 7.4.5 or above)
FortiClientEMS 8.0 (Not affected)
Gwendal Guégniaud of the Fortinet Product Security team has been credited with discovering and reporting the flaw.</p>

<p>While Fortinet makes no mention of the vulnerability being exploited in the wild, it’s essential that users move quickly to apply the fixes. The development comes as the company addressed another critical severity flaw in FortiOS, FortiManager, FortiAnalyzer, FortiProxy, FortiWeb (
CVE-2026-24858
, CVSS score: 9.4) that allows an attacker with a FortiCloud account and a registered device to log into other devices registered to other accounts, if FortiCloud SSO authentication is enabled on those devices. Fortinet has since acknowledged that the issue has been actively exploited by bad actors to create local admin accounts for persistence, make configuration changes granting VPN access to those accounts, and exfiltrate the firewall configurations.

<h2 id="zastai-raises-6m-pre-a-to-scale-zero-false-positive-ai-powered-code-security"><a id="article-6"></a>ZAST.AI Raises $6M Pre-A to Scale “Zero False Positive” AI-Powered Code Security</h2>

<p>January 5, 2026, Seattle, USA — ZAST.AI announced the completion of a $6 million Pre-A funding round. This investment came from the well-known investment firm Hillhouse Capital, bringing ZAST.AI’s total funding close to $10 million. This marks a recognition from leading capital markets of a new solution: ending the era of high false positive rates in security tools and making every alert genuinely actionable. In 2025, ZAST.AI discovered hundreds of zero-day vulnerabilities across dozens of popular open-source projects.</p>

<p>These findings were submitted through authoritative vulnerability platforms like VulDB, successfully resulting in
119 CVE assignments
. These are not laboratory targets, but production-grade code supporting global businesses. Affected well-known projects include widely used components and frameworks such as Microsoft Azure SDK, Apache Struts XWork, Alibaba Nacos, Langfuse, Koa, node-formidable, and others. It was precisely within these widely adopted open-source projects that ZAST.AI discovered hundreds of real, exploitable vulnerabilities accompanied by executable Proof-of-Concept (PoC) evidence.</p>

<p>Maintainers of these projects from top technology companies like Microsoft, Apache, and Alibaba have already patched their code based on the PoCs submitted by ZAST.AI. “In the traditional field of code security analysis, high false positive rates have long been a core pain point plaguing enterprise security teams. Security engineers often spend significant time manually verifying alerts generated by tools, resulting in extremely low efficiency,” said Geng Yang, Co-founder of ZAST.AI. “‘Report is cheap, show me the POC!’ This was the original intention behind founding ZAST.AI — we believe only verified vulnerabilities are worth reporting.”
ZAST.AI’s core innovation lies in its “Automated POC Generation + Automated Validation” technical architecture.</p>

<p>Unlike traditional static analysis tools, ZAST.AI leverages advanced AI technology to perform deep code analysis on applications. It can not only automatically generate Proof-of-Concept (PoC) code for exploiting vulnerabilities but also automatically execute and verify whether the PoC successfully triggers the vulnerability. The final report only presents real vulnerabilities that have been practically verified, achieving a breakthrough “zero false positive” effect. “This isn’t an optimization—it’s a reconstruction,” said a representative from Hillhouse Capital.</p>

<p>“ZAST.AI has redefined the standard for vulnerability validation, shifting from ‘potential risk’ to ‘confirmed vulnerability, here is the PoC.’ This changes the game.”
Regarding vulnerability coverage, ZAST.AI not only supports the detection of “syntax-level” vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, XSS, Insecure Deserialization, and SSRF but also possesses the capability to identify semantic-level vulnerabilities. This includes complex business logic flaws like IDOR, privilege escalation, and payment logic vulnerabilities—areas long considered difficult for automated tools to reach. Imagine your security tool crying “wolf” every day, with a false positive rate above 60%. By the time the real “wolf” appears, the team might already be desensitized.</p>

<p>This isn’t a people problem; it’s a tool defect—they can only
speculate
, not
prove
. Currently, ZAST.AI already serves multiple enterprise clients, including Fortune Global 500 companies. By automatically discovering unknown vulnerabilities and directly providing runnable PoC vulnerability reports, ZAST.AI helps clients significantly shorten vulnerability remediation cycles, markedly reduce security operation costs, and has gained high recognition from customers. This round of funding will primarily be used for core technology R&amp;D, product feature expansion, and global market development.</p>

<p>CEO, Geng Yang stated: “Our vision is to build an end-to-end AI-driven security platform, enabling every development team to obtain the highest quality security assurance at the lowest cost. In the future, ZAST.AI will continue to deepen technological innovation in AI + Security, providing global customers with smarter, more precise, and more efficient code security solutions.”

<h2 id="warlock-ransomware-breaches-smartertools-through-unpatched-smartermail-server"><a id="article-8"></a>Warlock Ransomware Breaches SmarterTools Through Unpatched SmarterMail Server</h2>

<p>SmarterTools confirmed last week that the Warlock (aka Storm-2603) ransomware gang breached its network by exploiting an unpatched SmarterMail instance. The incident took place on January 29, 2026, when a mail server that was not updated to the latest version was compromised, the company’s Chief Commercial Officer, Derek Curtis, said. “Prior to the breach, we had approximately 30 servers/VMs with SmarterMail installed throughout our network,” Curtis
explained
. “Unfortunately, we were unaware of one VM, set up by an employee, that was not being updated.</p>

<p>As a result, that mail server was compromised, which led to the breach.”
However, SmarterTools emphasized that the breach did not affect its website, shopping cart, My Account portal, and several other services, and that no business applications or account data were affected or compromised. About 12 Windows servers on the company’s office network, as well as a secondary data center used for quality control (QC) tests, are confirmed to be affected. According to its CEO, Tim Uzzanti, the “attempted ransomware attack” also impacted hosted customers using SmarterTrack. “Hosted customers using SmarterTrack were the most affected,” Uzzanti
said
in a different Community Portal threat.</p>

<p>“This was not due to any issue within SmarterTrack itself, but rather because that environment was more easily accessible than others once they breached our network.”
Furthermore, SmarterTools acknowledged that the Warlock group waited for a couple of days after gaining initial access to take control of the Active Directory server and create new users, followed by dropping additional payloads like
Velociraptor
and the locker to encrypt files. “Once these bad actors gain access, they typically install files and wait approximately 6–7 days before taking further action,” Curtis said. “This explains why some customers experienced a compromise even after updating – the initial breach occurred prior to the update, but malicious activity was triggered later.”
It’s currently not clear which SmarterMail vulnerability was weaponized by attackers, but it’s worth noting that multiple flaws in the email software –
CVE-2025-52691
(CVSS score: 10.0),
CVE-2026-23760
, and
CVE-2026-24423
(CVSS scores: 9.3) – have come under active exploitation in the wild. CVE-2026-23760 is an authentication bypass flaw that could allow any user to reset the SmarterMail system administrator password by sending a specially crafted HTTP request.</p>

<p>CVE-2026-24423, on the other hand, exploits a weakness in the ConnectToHub API method to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE). The vulnerabilities were addressed by SmarterTools in build 9511. Last week, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) confirmed that CVE-2026-24423 was being exploited in ransomware attacks.</p>

<p>In a report published Monday, cybersecurity company ReliaQuest said it identified activity likely linked to Warlock that involved the abuse of CVE-2026-23760 to bypass authentication and stage the ransomware payload on internet-facing systems. The attack also leverages the initial access to download a malicious MSI installer (“v4.msi”) from Supabase, a legitimate cloud-based backend platform, to install
Velociraptor
. “While this vulnerability allows attackers to bypass authentication and reset administrator passwords, Storm-2603 chains this access with the software’s built-in ‘Volume Mount’ feature to gain full system control,” security researcher Alexa Feminella
said
. “Upon entry, the group installs Velociraptor, a legitimate digital forensics tool it has used in previous campaigns, to maintain access and set the stage for ransomware.”
The security outfit also noted that the two vulnerabilities have the same net result: while CVE-2026-23760 grants unauthenticated administrative access via the password reset API, which can then be combined with the mounting logic to attain code execution, CVE-2026-24423 offers a more direct path to code execution through an API path.</p>

<p>The fact that the attackers are pursuing the former method is an indication that it likely allows the malicious activity to blend in with typical administrative workflows, helping them avoid detection. “By abusing legitimate features (password resets and drive mounting) instead of relying solely on a single ‘noisy’ exploit primitive, operators may reduce the effectiveness of detections tuned specifically for known RCE patterns,” Feminella added. “This pace of weaponization is consistent with ransomware operators rapidly analyzing vendor fixes and developing working tradecraft shortly after release.”
When reached for comment about the Warlock ransomware activity targeting SmarterTools, ReliaQuest told The Hacker News that it observed the attackers exploiting CVE-2026-23760 on unpatched systems running versions prior to Build 9511 shortly after the patch was released. “We confirmed this specific vulnerability was used because we observed successful password reset requests containing specific input designed to take over the built-in system administrator account,” the company said in an emailed statement.</p>

<p>“We also saw API calls consistent with probing for the second vulnerability, CVE-2026-24423, during the same window. However, the successful password reset activity confirms that CVE-2026-23760 was the method used to gain initial access.”
Users of SmarterMail are advised to upgrade to the latest version (
Build 9526
) with immediate effect for optimal protection, and isolate mail servers to block lateral movement attempts used to deploy ransomware. (The story was updated after publication to include a response from ReliaQuest.)

<h2 id="dutch-authorities-confirm-ivanti-zero-day-exploit-exposed-employee-contact-data"><a id="article-9"></a>Dutch Authorities Confirm Ivanti Zero-Day Exploit Exposed Employee Contact Data</h2>

<p>The Netherlands’ Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP) and the Council for the Judiciary confirmed both agencies (Rvdr) have disclosed that their systems were impacted by cyber attacks that exploited the recently disclosed security flaws in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM), according to a notice sent to the country’s parliament on Friday. “On January 29, the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) was informed by the supplier of vulnerabilities in EPMM,” the Dutch authorities
said
. “EPMM is used to manage mobile devices, apps, and content, including their security.”
“It is now known that work-related data of AP employees, such as names, business email addresses, and telephone numbers, have been accessed by unauthorized persons.”
The development comes as the European Commission also revealed that its central infrastructure managing mobile devices “identified traces” of a cyber attack that may have resulted in access to names and mobile numbers of some of its staff members. The Commission said the incident was contained within nine hours, and that no compromise of mobile devices was detected.</p>

<p>“The Commission takes seriously the security and resilience of its internal systems and data and will continue to monitor the situation,” it
added
. “It will take all necessary measures to ensure the security of its systems.”
Although the name of the vendor was specified and no details were shared on how the attackers managed to gain access, it’s suspected to be linked to malicious activity exploiting flaws in Ivanti EPMM. Finland’s state information and communications technology provider, Valtori, also
disclosed
a breach that exposed work-related details of up to 50,000 government employees. The incident, identified on January 30, 2026, targeted a zero-day vulnerability in the mobile device management service.</p>

<p>The agency said it installed the corrective patch on January 29, 2026, the same day Ivanti released fixes for
CVE-2026-1281 and CVE-2026-1340
(CVSS scores: 9.8), which could be exploited by an attacker to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution. Ivanti has acknowledged that the vulnerabilities have been exploited as zero-days, and that a “very limited number of customers” were exploited, but it has not provided an updated victim count. The attacker is said to have gained access to information used in operating the service, including names, work email addresses, phone numbers, and device details. “Investigations have shown that the management system did not permanently delete removed data but only marked it as deleted,” it said “As a result, device and user data belonging to all organizations that have used the service during its lifecycle may have been compromised.</p>

<p>In certain cases, a single mobile device may have multiple users.”
watchTowr CEO Benjamin Harris told The Hacker News in an emailed statement that the attacks are not acts of random opportunism, but rather the work of a “highly skilled, well-resourced actor executing a precision campaign.”
“Attackers are targeting your most trusted, deeply embedded enterprise systems. Anything assumed to be ‘internal’ or ‘safe’ should now be viewed with suspicion,” Harris said. “Resilience is as important as prevention, especially when attackers move fast and operate with surgical precision. What differentiates minor headaches from full-blown crises is speed: how quickly teams identify anomalies, validate weaknesses, and contain the damage.”

<h2 id="china-linked-unc3886-targets-singapore-telecom-sector-in-cyber-espionage-campaign"><a id="article-10"></a>China-Linked UNC3886 Targets Singapore Telecom Sector in Cyber Espionage Campaign</h2>

<p>The Cyber Security Agency (CSA) of Singapore on Monday revealed that the China-nexus cyber espionage group known as
UNC3886
targeted its telecommunications sector. “UNC3886 had launched a deliberate, targeted, and well-planned campaign against Singapore’s telecommunications sector,” CSA
said
. “All four of Singapore’s major telecommunications operators (‘telcos’) – M1, SIMBA Telecom, Singtel, and StarHub – have been the target of attacks.”
The development comes more than six months after Singapore’s Coordinating Minister for National Security, K. Shanmugam,
accused
UNC3886 of striking high-value strategic threat targets.</p>

<p>UNC3886 is assessed to be active since at least 2022, targeting edge devices and virtualization technologies to obtain initial access. In July 2025, Sygnia
disclosed
details of a long-term cyber espionage campaign attributed to a threat cluster it tracks as Fire Ant and which shares tooling and targeting overlaps with UNC3886, stating the adversary infiltrates organizations’ VMware ESXi and vCenter environments as well as network appliances. Describing UNC3886 as an advanced persistent threat (APT) with “deep capabilities,” CSA said the threat actors deployed sophisticated tools to gain access into telco systems, in one instance even weaponizing a zero-day exploit to bypass a perimeter firewall and siphon a small amount of technical data to further its operational objectives. The exact specifics of the flaw were not disclosed.</p>

<p>In a second case, UNC3886 is said to have deployed rootkits to establish persistent access and conceal their tracks to fly under the radar. Other activities undertaken by the threat actor include gaining unauthorized access to “some parts” of telco networks and systems, including those deemed critical, although it’s assessed that the incident was not severe enough to disrupt services. CSA said it mounted a 11-month-long cyber operation dubbed CYBER GUARDIAN to counter the threat and limit the attackers’ movement into telecom networks. It also emphasized that there is no evidence that the threat actor exfiltrated personal data such as customer records or cut off internet availability.</p>

<p>“Cyber defenders have since implemented remediation measures, closed off UNC3886’s access points, and expanded monitoring capabilities in the targeted telcos,” the agency said. The campaign targeting European government institutions coincides with the discovery of what appears to be a coordinated activity targeting EPMM instances to upload a dormant payload following the exploitation of CVE-2026-1281 and CVE-2026-1340, creating a pathway for future attacks. The main responsibility of the loader is to receive, load, and execute a second Java class delivered via HTTP. “This campaign deployed a dormant in-memory Java class loader to /mifs/403.jsp – a somewhat lesser common web shell path,” the company
said
.</p>

<p>“The implant can only be activated with a specific trigger parameter, and no follow-on exploitation has yet been observed. This is suggestive of initial access broker (IAB) tradecraft: gain a foothold, then sell or hand off access later.”

<h2 id="solarwinds-web-help-desk-exploited-for-rce-in-multi-stage-attacks-on-exposed-servers"><a id="article-11"></a>SolarWinds Web Help Desk Exploited for RCE in Multi-Stage Attacks on Exposed Servers</h2>

<p>Microsoft has
revealed
that it observed a multi‑stage intrusion that involved the threat actors exploiting internet‑exposed SolarWinds Web Help Desk (WHD) instances to obtain initial access and move laterally across the organization’s network to other high-value assets. That said, the Microsoft Defender Security Research Team said it’s not clear whether the activity weaponized
recently disclosed flaws
(CVE-2025-40551, CVSS score: 9.8, and CVE-2025-40536, CVSS score: 8.1), or a
previously patched vulnerability
(CVE-2025-26399, CVSS score: 9.8). “Since the attacks occurred in December 2025 and on machines vulnerable to both the old and new set of CVEs at the same time, we cannot reliably confirm the exact CVE used to gain an initial foothold,” the company said in a report published last week. While CVE-2025-40536 is a security control bypass vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to certain restricted functionality, CVE-2025-40551 and CVE-2025-26399 both refer to untrusted data deserialization vulnerabilities that could lead to remote code execution.</p>

<p>Last week, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
added
CVE-2025-40551 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation in the wild. Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies were ordered to apply the fixes for the flaw by February 6, 2026. In the attacks detected by Microsoft, successful exploitation of the exposed SolarWinds WHD instance allowed the attackers to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution and run arbitrary commands within the WHD application context.</p>

<p>“Upon successful exploitation, the compromised service of a WHD instance spawned PowerShell to leverage
BITS
[Background Intelligent Transfer Service] for payload download and execution,” researchers Sagar Patil, Hardik Suri, Eric Hopper, and Kajhon Soyini noted. In the next stage, the threat actors downloaded legitimate components associated with Zoho ManageEngine, a legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) solution, to enable persistent remote control over the infected system. The attackers followed it up with a series of actions -
Enumerated sensitive domain users and groups, including Domain Admins. Established persistence via reverse SSH and RDP access, with the attackers also attempting to create a scheduled task to launch a QEMU virtual machine under the SYSTEM account at system startup to cover up the tracks within a virtualized environment while exposing SSH access via port forwarding.</p>

<p>Used DLL side-loading on some hosts by using “wab.exe,” a legitimate system executable associated with the Windows Address Book, to launch a rogue DLL (“sspicli.dll”) to dump the contents of LSASS memory and conduct credential theft. In at least one case, Microsoft said the threat actors conducted a
DCSync attack
, where a Domain Controller (DC) is
simulated
to request
password hashes
and other sensitive information from an Active Directory (AD) database. To counter the threat, users are advised to keep the WHD instances up-to-date, find and remove any unauthorized RMM tools, rotate service and admin accounts, and isolate compromised machines to limit the breach. “This activity reflects a common but high-impact pattern: a single exposed application can provide a path to full domain compromise when vulnerabilities are unpatched or insufficiently monitored,” the Windows maker said.</p>

<p>“In this intrusion, attackers relied heavily on living-off-the-land techniques, legitimate administrative tools, and low-noise persistence mechanisms. These tradecraft choices reinforce the importance of defense in depth, timely patching of internet-facing services, and behavior-based detection across identity, endpoint, and network layers.”
Update
In a report published on February 8, 2026, cybersecurity company Huntress
said
it investigated a case of SolarWinds WHD exploitation, in which the threat actor rapidly deployed Zoho Meetings and Cloudflare tunnels for persistence, as well as a legitimate forensics tool called
Velociraptor
for command-and-control (C2). The incident occurred on February 7, 2026. The following sequence of post-exploitation actions describes how the attack unfolded -
Launched “cmd.exe” to install a remote MSI payload associated with Zoho ManageEngine RMM and established remote access by configuring the Zoho Assist agent for unattended access and registering the compromised host to a Zoho Assist account tied to a Proton Mail address “esmahyft@proton[.]me.”
Executed Active Directory discovery commands to enumerate domain-joined machines for reconnaissance.</p>

<p>Leveraged the Zoho Assist remote session to deploy Velociraptor version 0.73.4, an outdated version with a known privilege escalation vulnerability (
CVE-2025-6264
). Used the Velociraptor agent to execute PowerShell commands to check for the presence of “code.exe,” a Visual Studio Code binary with the likely intent of establishing a remote tunnel. Installed
Cloudflared
to establish an additional tunnel-based channel for redundant access to the compromised host. Executed a PowerShell script that collects comprehensive system information and transmits it directly to an attacker-controlled Elastic Cloud instance.</p>

<p>Disabled Windows Defender and Windows Firewall via Registry modifications. Executed a script that implements a live C2 failover mechanism for the Velociraptor agent to connect it to a different server (“v2-api.mooo[.]com”) if the original Cloudflare workers[.]dev domain has been detected. It achieves this by sending a request to the failover server and checking the HTTP response code. If the status is
406 Not Acceptable
, the Velociraptor is reconfigured to talk to the new server.</p>

<p>Created scheduled tasks that use QEMU to open an SSH backdoor as a persistence mechanism. “The Velociraptor server URL, https://auth.qgtxtebl.workers[.]dev/, utilizes a Cloudflare Worker from the same Cloudflare account we have seen before across multiple intrusions involving ToolShell exploitation, and
Warlock
ransomware deployment, identified by the shared per-account identifier component of the subdomain: qgtxtebl,” Huntress researchers noted. Found this article interesting? Follow us on

<h2 id="-weekly-recap-ai-skill-malware-31tbps-ddos-notepad-hack-llm-backdoors-and-more"><a id="article-12"></a>⚡ Weekly Recap: AI Skill Malware, 31Tbps DDoS, Notepad++ Hack, LLM Backdoors and More</h2>

<p>Cyber threats are no longer coming from just malware or exploits. They’re showing up inside the tools, platforms, and ecosystems organizations use every day. As companies connect AI, cloud apps, developer tools, and communication systems, attackers are following those same paths. A clear pattern this week: attackers are abusing trust.</p>

<p>Trusted updates, trusted marketplaces, trusted apps, even trusted AI workflows. Instead of breaking security controls head-on, they’re slipping into places that already have access. This recap brings together those signals — showing how modern attacks are blending technology abuse, ecosystem manipulation, and large-scale targeting into a single, expanding threat surface. ⚡ Threat of the Week
OpenClaw announces VirusTotal Partnership
— OpenClaw has announced a partnership with Google’s VirusTotal malware scanning platform to scan skills that are being uploaded to ClawHub as part of a defense-in-depth approach to improve the security of the agentic ecosystem.</p>

<p>The development comes as the cybersecurity community has raised concerns that autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) tools’ persistent memory, broad permissions, and user‑controlled configuration could amplify existing risks, leading to prompt injections, data exfiltration, and exposure to unvetted components. This has also been complemented by the discovery of
malicious skills on ClawHub
, a public skills registry to augment the capabilities of AI agents, once again demonstrating that marketplaces are a gold mine for criminals who populate the store with malware to prey on developers. To make matters worse, Trend Micro disclosed that it observed malicious actors on the Exploit.in forum actively discussing the deployment of OpenClaw skills to support activities such as botnet operations. Another report from Veracode
revealed
that the number of packages on npm and PyPI with the name “claw” has increased exponentially from nearly zero at the start of the year to over 1,000 as of early February 2026, providing new avenues for threat actors to smuggle malicious typosquats.</p>

<p>“Unsupervised deployment, broad permissions, and high autonomy can turn theoretical risks into tangible threats, not just for individual users but also across entire organizations,” Trend Micro
said
. “Open-source agentic tools like OpenClaw require a higher baseline of user security competence than managed platforms.”
Bad Actors Are Using New AI Capabilities and Powerful AI Agents
Traditional firewalls and VPNs aren’t helping—instead, they’re expanding your attack surface and enabling lateral threat movement. They’re also more easily exploited with AI-powered attacks. It’s time for Zero Trust + AI.</p>

German Agencies Warn of Signal Phishing
— Germany’s Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (aka Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz or BfV) and Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) have issued a joint advisory warning of a malicious cyber campaign undertaken by a likely state-sponsored threat actor that involves carrying out phishing attacks over the Signal messaging app. The attacks have been mainly directed at high-ranking targets in politics, the military, and diplomacy, as well as investigative journalists in Germany and Europe. The attack chains exploit legitimate PIN and device linking features in Signal to take control of victims’ accounts. AISURU Botnet Behind 31.4 Tbps DDoS Attack
— The botnet known as AISURU/Kimwolf has been attributed to a record-setting distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that peaked at 31.4 Terabits per second (Tbps) and lasted only 35 seconds.</p>

<p>The attack took place in November 2025, according to Cloudflare, which automatically detected and mitigated the activity. AISURU/Kimwolf has also been linked to another DDoS campaign codenamed The Night Before Christmas that commenced on December 19, 2025. In all, DDoS attacks surged by 121% in 2025, reaching an average of 5,376 attacks automatically mitigated every hour. Notepad++ Hosting Infrastructure Breached to Distribute Chrysalis Backdoor
— Between June and October 2025, threat actors quietly and very selectively redirected traffic from Notepad++’s updater program, WinGUp, to an attacker-controlled server that downloaded malicious executables.</p>

<p>While the attacker lost their foothold on the third-party hosting provider’s server on September 2, 2025, following scheduled maintenance where the server firmware and kernel were updated. However, the attackers still had valid credentials in their possession, which they used to continue routing Notepad++ update traffic to their malicious servers until at least December 2, 2025. The adversary specifically targeted the Notepad++ domain by taking advantage of its insufficient update verification controls that existed in older versions of Notepad++. The findings show that updates cannot be treated as trusted just because they come from a legitimate domain, as the blind spot can be abused as a vector for malware distribution.</p>

<p>The sophisticated supply chain attack has been attributed to a threat actor known as Lotus Blossom. “Attackers prize distribution points that touch a large population,” a Forrester analysis
said
. “Update servers, download portals, package managers, and hosting platforms become efficient delivery systems, because one compromise creates thousands of downstream victims.”
DockerDash Flaw in Docker AI Assistant Leads to RCE
— A critical-severity bug in Docker’s Ask Gordon AI assistant can be exploited to compromise Docker environments. Called DockerDash, the vulnerability exists in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Gateway’s contextual trust, where malicious instructions embedded into a Docker image’s metadata labels are forwarded to the MCP and executed without validation.</p>

<p>This is made possible because the MCP Gateway does not distinguish between informational metadata and runnable internal instructions. Furthermore, the AI assistant trusts all image metadata as safe contextual information and interprets commands in metadata as legitimate tasks. Noma Security named the technique meta-context injection. It was addressed by Docker with the release of version 4.50.0 in November 2025.</p>

<p>Microsoft Develops Scanner to Detect Hidden Backdoors in LLMs
— Microsoft has developed a scanner designed to detect backdoors in open-weight AI models in hopes of addressing a critical blind spot for enterprises that are dependent on third-party large language models (LLMs). The company said it identified three observable indicators that suggest the presence of backdoors in language models: a shift in how a model pays attention to a prompt when a hidden trigger is present, almost independently from the rest of the prompt; models tend to leak their own poisoned data, and partial versions of the backdoor can still trigger the intended response. “The scanner we developed first extracts memorized content from the model and then analyzes it to isolate salient substrings,” Microsoft noted. “Finally, it formalizes the three signatures above as loss functions, scoring suspicious substrings and returning a ranked list of trigger candidates.”

OpenClaw is Riddled With Security Concerns
— The skyrocketing popularity of OpenClaw (née Clawdbot and Moltbot) has attracted cybersecurity worries. With artificial intelligence (AI) agents having entrenched access to sensitive data, giving “bring-your-own-AI” systems privileged access to applications and the user conversations carries significant security risks.</p>

<p>The architectural concentration of power means AI agents are designed to store secrets and execute actions – features that are all essential to meet their objectives. But when they are misconfigured, the very design that serves as their backbone can collapse multiple security boundaries at once. Pillar Security has warned that attackers are actively scanning exposed OpenClaw gateways on port 18789. “The traffic included prompt injection attempts targeting the AI layer – but the more sophisticated attackers skipped the AI entirely,” researchers Ariel Fogel and Eilon Cohen
said
.</p>

<p>“They connected directly to the gateway’s WebSocket API and attempted authentication bypasses, protocol downgrades to pre-patch versions, and raw command execution.” Attack surface management firm Censys
said
it identified 21,639 exposed OpenClaw instances as of January 31, 2026. “Clawdbot represents the future of personal AI, but its security posture relies on an outdated model of endpoint trust,” said Hudson Rock. “Without encryption-at-rest or containerization, the ‘Local-First’ AI revolution risks becoming a goldmine for the global cybercrime economy.”
Prompt Injection Risks in MoltBook
— A
new analysis
of MoltBook posts has revealed several
critical risks
, including “506 prompt injection attacks targeting AI readers, sophisticated social engineering tactics exploiting agent psychology,” anti-human manifestos receiving hundreds of thousands of upvotes, and unregulated cryptocurrency activity comprising 19.3% of all content,” according to Simula Research Laboratory. British programmer Simon Willison, who coined the term prompt injection in 2022, has
described
Moltbook as the “most interesting place on the internet right now.” Vibe, coded by its creator, Matt Schlicht, Moltbook marks the first time AI agents built atop the OpenClaw platform can communicate with each other, post, comment, upvote, and create sub-communities without human intervention.</p>

<p>While Moltbook is pitched as a way to offload tedious tasks, equally apparent are the security pitfalls, given the deep access the AI agents have to personal information. Prompt injection attacks hidden in natural language text can instruct an AI agent to reveal private data. Malicious npm Packages Use EtherHiding Technique
— Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a set of 54 malicious npm packages targeting Windows systems that use an Ethereum smart contract as a dead drop resolver to fetch a command-and-control (C2) server to receive next-stage payloads. This technique, codename
EtherHiding
, is notable because it makes takedown efforts more difficult, allowing the operators to modify the infrastructure without making any changes to the malware itself.”The malware includes environment checks designed to evade sandbox detection, specifically targeting Windows systems with 5 or more CPUs,” Veracode
said
.</p>

<p>Other capabilities of the malware include system profiling, registry persistence via a COM hijacking technique, and a loader to execute the second-stage payload delivered by the C2. The C2 server is currently inactive, making it unclear what the exact motives are. Ukraine Rolls Out Verification for Starlink
— Ukraine has
rolled out
a verification system for Starlink satellite internet terminals used by civilians and the military after confirming that Russian forces have begun installing the technology on attack drones. The Ukrainian government has introduced a mandatory allowlist for Starlink terminals, as part of which only verified and registered devices will be allowed to operate in the country.</p>

— The Jordanian government used Cellebrite digital forensic software to extract data from phones belonging to at least seven Jordanian activists and human rights defenders between late 2023 and mid-2025, according to a
new report
published by the Citizen Lab. The extractions occurred while the activists were being interrogated or detained by authorities. Some of the recent victims were activists who organized protests in support of Palestinians in Gaza.</p>

<p>Citizen Lab said it uncovered iOS and Android indicators of compromise tied to Cellebrite in all four phones it forensically analyzed. It’s suspected that authorities have been using Cellebrite since at least 2020. ShadowHS, a Fileless Linux Post‑Exploitation Framework
— Threat hunters have discovered a stealthy Linux framework that runs entirely in memory for covert, post-exploitation control. The activity has been codenamed ShadowHS by Cyble.</p>

<p>“Unlike conventional Linux malware that emphasizes automated propagation or immediate monetization, this activity prioritizes stealth, operator safety, and long‑term interactive control over compromised systems,” the company
said
. “The loader decrypts and executes its payload exclusively in memory, leaving no persistent binary artifacts on disk. Once active, the payload exposes an interactive post‑exploitation environment that aggressively fingerprints host security controls, enumerates defensive tooling, and evaluates prior compromise before enabling higher‑risk actions.” The framework supports various dormant modules that support credential access, lateral movement, privilege escalation, cryptomining, memory inspection, and data exfiltration. Incognito Operator Gets 30 Years in Prison
— Rui-Siang Lin, 24, was sentenced to 30 years in U.S.</p>

<p>prison for his role as an administrator of Incognito Market, which facilitated millions of dollars’ worth of drug sales. Lin ran Incognito Market from January 2022 to March 2024 under the moniker “Pharaoh,” enabling the sale of more than $105 million of narcotics. Incognito Market allowed about 1,800 vendors to sell to a customer base exceeding 400,000 accounts. In all, the operation facilitated about 640,000 narcotics transactions.</p>

<p>Lin was
arrested
in May 2024, and he
pleaded guilty
to the charges later that December. “While Lin made millions, his offenses had devastating consequences,”
said
U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton. “He is responsible for at least one tragic death, and he exacerbated the opioid crisis and caused misery for more than 470,000 narcotics users and their families.”
INC Ransomware Group’s Slip-Up Proves Costly
— Cybersecurity firm Cyber Centaurs
said
it has helped a dozen victims
recover their data
after breaking into the backup server of the INC Ransomware group, where the stolen data was dumped.</p>

<p>The INC group started operations in 2023 and has listed more than 100 victims on its dark web leak site. “While INC Ransomware demonstrated careful planning, hands-on execution, and effective use of legitimate tools (LOTL), they also left behind infrastructure and artifacts that reflected reuse, assumption, and oversight,” the company said. “In this instance, those remnants, particularly related to Restic, created an opening that would not normally exist in a typical ransomware response.”
Xinbi Marketplace Accounts for $17.9B in Total Volume
— A new analysis from TRM Labs has revealed that the illicit Telegram-based guarantee marketplace known as
Xinbi
has continued to remain active, while those of its competitors, Haowang (aka HuiOne) Guarantee and Tudou Guarantee, dropped by 100% and 74%, respectively. Wallets associated with Xinbi have received approximately $8.9 billion and processed roughly $17.9 billion in total transaction volume.</p>

<p>Conclusion
The takeaway this week is simple: exposure is growing faster than visibility. Many risks aren’t coming from unknown threats, but from known systems being used in unexpected ways. Security teams are being forced to watch not just networks and endpoints, but ecosystems, integrations, and automated workflows. What matters now is readiness across layers — software, supply chains, AI tooling, infrastructure, and user platforms.</p>

<p>Attackers are operating across all of them at once, blending old techniques with new access paths. Staying secure is no longer about fixing one flaw at a time. It’s about understanding how every connected system can influence the next — and closing those gaps before they’re chained together. Found this article interesting?</p>

<h2 id="how-top-cisos-solve-burnout-and-speed-up-mttr-without-extra-hiring"><a id="article-13"></a>How Top CISOs Solve Burnout and Speed up MTTR without Extra Hiring</h2>

<p>Why do SOC teams keep burning out and missing SLAs even after spending big on security tools? Routine triage piles up, senior specialists get dragged into basic validation, and MTTR climbs, while stealthy threats still find room to slip through. Top CISOs have realized the solution isn’t hiring more people or stacking yet another tool onto the workflow, but giving their teams faster, clearer behavior evidence from the start. Here’s how they’re breaking the cycle and speeding up response without extra hiring.</p>

<p>Starting with Sandbox-First Investigation to Cut MTTR at the Source
The fastest way to reduce MTTR is to remove the delays baked into investigations. Static verdicts and fragmented workflows force analysts to guess, escalate, and re-check the same alerts, which drives burnout and slows containment. That’s why top CISOs are making
sandbox execution the first step
. With an interactive sandbox like
ANY.RUN
, teams can detonate suspicious files and links in an isolated environment and see real behavior immediately, so decisions happen early, not after hours of back-and-forth.</p>

<p>Check the real case of a phishing attack exposed in 33 seconds
Full phishing attack chain analyzed inside an interactive sandbox in real time, revealing a fake Microsoft login page
Why CISOs prioritize sandbox-first workflows:
MTTR drops because clarity comes in minutes:
Runtime evidence replaces assumptions, so qualification and containment start faster. Fewer escalations, less senior time wasted:
Tier-1 validates alerts with behavior proof, driving up to a
30% reduction in Tier-1 → Tier-2 escalations
and keeping specialists focused on real incidents. Lower burnout through fewer manual steps:
Less “chasing context,” fewer repeats, more predictable workloads. Save up to
21 minutes per case
by making alert qualification evidence-driven, freeing senior time, reducing escalations, and lowering incident cost.</p>

<p>Reduce MTTR in your SOC
Automating Triage to Increase SOC Output and Protect SLAs
After early clarity comes scale. Even with strong visibility, SOCs slow down if every alert still demands manual effort. By automating triage, CISOs unlock measurable gains across response speed, workload balance, and SOC efficiency:
Faster investigations, faster containment:
Automated execution shortens the gap between alert and decision, directly reducing MTTR. Fewer errors under pressure:
Consistent handling of routine steps lowers risk during high-volume periods.</p>

<p>More impact from the same team:
Junior staff resolve more alerts independently, reducing escalation load on senior specialists. Better use of senior expertise:
Experts spend time on real incidents, not revalidating basic alerts. Higher SOC efficiency overall:
Less fatigue, fewer handoffs, and steadier SLA performance. In real phishing and malware campaigns, attackers often hide malicious behavior behind QR codes, redirect chains, or CAPTCHA gates.</p>

<p>Manually replaying these steps costs time and attention, exactly what SOC teams don’t have. Phishing attack with QR code exposed with the help of automation and interactivity, saving time and resources
With automated sandbox execution, those steps are handled instantly. Hidden URLs are opened, gating is passed, and malicious behavior is exposed within seconds, without waiting, retries, or workarounds. Malicious URL revealed inside ANY.RUN sandbox
Analysts can still step in live at any moment, inspect processes, or trigger additional actions, but they’re no longer burdened by repetitive setup work.</p>

<p>Giving the team this dual approach,
automation plus interactivity,
means the following for CISOs: faster response, lower workload, and more SOC capacity, without adding headcount. Automation not only speeds up investigations but also stabilizes the team behind them. Reducing Burnout by Removing Decision Fatigue
Burnout in the SOC isn’t caused by a lack of commitment. It’s caused by constant high-stakes decisions made with incomplete information.</p>

<p>When teams spend their shifts deciding whether alerts are “probably fine” or “worth escalating,” stress compounds quickly. Sandbox-first and automated triage workflows change that dynamic. Instead of guessing, teams work from
observable behavior. They get
structured outputs
they can act on immediately: behavior timelines, extracted IOCs, mapped TTPs, and clear, shareable reports that make handoffs fast and decisions defensible.</p>

<p>When time is tight, built-in AI assistance helps summarize what matters, so analysts spend less energy interpreting noise and more time closing cases. ANY.RUN’s auto-generated reports for fast and efficient sharing
For CISOs, the impact shows up in several ways:
More predictable workloads:
Investigations follow consistent paths instead of expanding unpredictably. Lower fatigue across shifts:
Less manual replay, fewer tool switches, and fewer stalled cases. Stronger team retention:
Teams stay engaged when work leads to confident outcomes, not constant uncertainty.</p>

<p>When decision fatigue drops, MTTR follows. The SOC becomes calmer, more focused, and easier to run, not because threats are simpler, but because the workflow is. What CISOs Are Reporting After Moving to Evidence-Based Response
After shifting to sandbox-first investigation, automated triage, and built-in collaboration, CISOs are using
ANY.RUN
report consistent improvements in how sustainably their SOCs operate. Across teams, leaders are seeing:
Up to 3× increase in SOC output:
More alerts handled with the same team, driven by faster qualification and fewer repeat steps.</p>

<p>MTTR reduced by up to 50%:
Early execution evidence shortens investigations and accelerates containment. Up to 30% fewer Tier-1 → Tier-2 escalations:
Clear behavior proof enables junior staff to resolve cases confidently. Higher detection rates for evasive threats:
90% of organizations report higher detection rates, particularly for stealthy and evasive threats. Lower burnout and steadier SLA performance:
Predictable workflows replace constant firefighting, easing pressure across shifts.</p>

<p>These numbers reflect real operational gains: faster response without extra hiring, better use of senior expertise, and a SOC that scales without exhausting the people running it. Build a Faster, More Sustainable SOC Without Extra Hiring
The best SOCs don’t wait. They respond fast, protect their teams from burnout, and stay steady even when alert volume spikes. But that only happens when the investigation workflow is built for speed and sustainability.</p>

<p>By making sandbox execution the first step, automating repetitive triage, and keeping investigation context shared and controlled, top CISOs are cutting MTTR without adding headcount. ANY.RUN
brings that foundation together in one place. It gives your team the visibility, automation, and enterprise-grade control needed to reduce delays, lower escalation pressure, and keep operations stable. Trusted by CISOs to deliver:
Faster MTTR through early behavior evidence
Lower risk of business disruption and costly incidents
Fewer unnecessary escalations and cleaner handoffs
Less burnout and better team retention
Stronger ROI from existing security investments

<h2 id="bloody-wolf-targets-uzbekistan-russia-using-netsupport-rat-in-spear-phishing-campaign"><a id="article-14"></a>Bloody Wolf Targets Uzbekistan, Russia Using NetSupport RAT in Spear-Phishing Campaign</h2>

<p>The threat actor known as
Bloody Wolf
has been linked to a campaign targeting Uzbekistan and Russia to infect systems with a remote access trojan known as
NetSupport RAT
. Cybersecurity vendor Kaspersky is tracking the activity under the moniker
Stan Ghouls
. The threat actor is known to be active since at least 2023, orchestrating spear-phishing attacks against manufacturing, finance, and IT sectors in Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. The campaign is estimated to have claimed about 50 victims in Uzbekistan, with 10 devices in Russia also impacted.</p>

<p>Other infections have been identified to a lesser degree in Kazakhstan, Turkey, Serbia, and Belarus. Infection attempts have also been recorded on devices within government organizations, logistics companies, medical facilities, and educational institutions. “Given Stan Ghouls’ targeting of financial institutions, we believe their primary motive is financial gain,” Kaspersky noted. “That said, their heavy use of RATs may also hint at cyber espionage.”
The misuse of NetSupport, a legitimate remote administration tool, is a departure for the threat actor, which previously leveraged STRRAT (aka Strigoi Master) in its attacks.</p>

<p>In November 2025, Group-IB
documented
phishing attacks aimed at entities in Kyrgyzstan to distribute the tool. The attack chains are fairly straightforward in that phishing emails loaded with malicious PDF attachments are used as a launchpad to trigger the infection. The PDF documents embed links that, when clicked, lead to the download of a malicious loader that handles multiple tasks -
Display a fake error message to give the impression to the victim that the application can’t run on their machine. Check if the number of previous RAT installation attempts is less than three.</p>

<p>If the number has reached or exceeded the limit, the loader throws an error message: “Attempt limit reached. Try another computer.”
Download the NetSupport RAT from one of the several external domains and launch it. Ensure NetSupport RAT’s persistence by configuring an autorun script in the Startup folder, adding a NetSupport launch script (“run.bat”) to the Registry’s autorun key, and creating a scheduled task to trigger the execution of the same batch script. Kaspersky said it also identified
Mirai botnet payloads
staged on infrastructure associated with Bloody Wolf, raising the possibility that the threat actor may have expanded its malware arsenal to target IoT devices.</p>

<p>“With over 60 targets hit, this is a remarkably high volume for a sophisticated targeted campaign,” the company concluded. “It points to the significant resources these actors are willing to pour into their operations.”
The disclosure coincides with a number of cyber campaigns targeting Russian organizations, including those conducted by
ExCobalt
, which has leveraged known security flaws and credentials stolen from contractors to obtain initial access to target networks. Positive Technologies
described
the adversary as one of the “most dangerous groups” attacking Russian entities. The attacks are characterized by the use of various tools, along with attempts to siphon Telegram credentials and message history from the compromised hosts and Outlook Web Access credentials by
injecting malicious code into the login page
-
CobInt
, a known backdoor used by the group.</p>

<p>Lockers such as Babuk and LockBit. PUMAKIT
, a
kernel rootkit
to escalate privileges, hide files and directories, and conceal itself from system tools, along with prior iterations known as Facefish (February 2021), Kitsune (February 2022), and Megatsune (November 2023). The use of Kitsune was also linked to a threat cluster known as
Sneaky Wolf
(aka Sneaking Leprechaun) by BI.ZONE. Octopus, a Rust-based toolkit that’s used to elevate privileges in a compromised Linux system.</p>

<p>“The group changed the tactics of initial access, shifting the focus of attention from the exploitation of 1-day vulnerabilities in corporate services available from the internet (e.g., Microsoft Exchange) to the penetration of the infrastructure of the main target through contractors,” Positive Technologies said. State institutions, scientific enterprises, and IT organizations in Russia have also been targeted by a previously unknown threat actor known as
Punishing Owl
that has resorted to stealing and leaking data on the dark web. The group, suspected to be a politically motivated hacktivist entity, has been active since December 2025, with one of its social media accounts administered from Kazakhstan. The attacks utilize phishing emails with a password-protected ZIP archive, which, when opened, contains a Windows shortcut (LNK) masquerading as a PDF document.</p>

<p>Opening the LNK file results in the execution of a PowerShell command to download a stealer named ZipWhisper from a remote server to harvest sensitive data and upload it to the same server. Another threat cluster that has trained its sights on Russia and Belarus is
Vortex Werewolf
. The end goal of the attacks is to deploy Tor and OpenSSH so as to facilitate persistent remote access. The campaign was previously exposed in November 2025 by Cyble and Seqrite Labs, with the latter calling the campaign
Operation SkyCloak
