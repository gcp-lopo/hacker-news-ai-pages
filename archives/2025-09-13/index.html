<p>Samsung has released its monthly security updates for Android, including a fix for a security vulnerability that it said has been exploited in zero-day attacks. The vulnerability,
CVE-2025-21043
(CVSS score: 8.8), concerns an out-of-bounds write that could result in arbitrary code execution. ‚ÄúOut-of-bounds Write in libimagecodec.quram.so prior to SMR Sep-2025 Release 1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code,‚Äù Samsung
said
in an advisory. ‚ÄúThe patch fixed the incorrect implementation.‚Äù
According to a
2020 report
from Google Project Zero, libimagecodec.quram.so is a closed-source image parsing library developed by Quramsoft that implements support for various image formats.</p>

<p>The critical-rated issue, per the South Korean electronics giant, affects Android versions 13, 14, 15, and 16. The vulnerability was privately disclosed to the company on August 13, 2025. Samsung did not share any specifics on how the vulnerability is being exploited in attacks and who may be behind these efforts. However, it acknowledged that ‚Äúan exploit for this issue has existed in the wild.‚Äù
The development comes shortly after Google
said
it resolved two security flaws in Android (CVE-2025-38352 and CVE-2025-48543) that it said have been exploited in targeted attacks.</p>

<h2 id="apple-warns-french-users-of-fourth-spyware-campaign-in-2025-cert-fr-confirms"><a id="article-2"></a>Apple Warns French Users of Fourth Spyware Campaign in 2025, CERT-FR Confirms</h2>

<p>Apple has notified users in France of a spyware campaign targeting their devices, according to the Computer Emergency Response Team of France (CERT-FR). The agency
said
the alerts were sent out on September 3, 2025, making it the fourth time this year that Apple has notified citizens in the county that at least one of the devices linked to their iCloud accounts may have been compromised as part of highly-targeted attacks. The agency did not share further details on what triggered these alerts. Previous threat notifications were sent on March 5,
April 29
, and June 25.</p>

<p>Apple has been
sending
these
notices
since November 2021. ‚ÄúThese complex attacks target individuals for their status or function: journalists, lawyers, activists, politicians, senior officials, members of steering committees of strategic sectors, etc,‚Äù CERT-FR said. The development comes less than a month after it emerged that a security flaw in WhatsApp (
CVE-2025-55177
, CVSS score: 5.4) was chained with an Apple iOS bug (
CVE-2025-43300
, CVSS score: 8.8) as part of zero-click attacks. WhatsApp subsequently told The Hacker News that it had sent in-app threat notifications to less than 200 users who may have been targeted as part of the campaign.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not known who, and which commercial spyware vendor, is behind the activity. The disclosure comes as Apple has
introduced
a security feature in the latest iPhone models called Memory Integrity Enforcement (MIE) to combat memory corruption vulnerabilities and make it harder for surveillance vendors, who typically rely on such zero-days for planting spyware on a target‚Äôs phone. In a report published this week, the Atlantic Council said the number of United States investors in spyware and surveillance technologies jumped from 11 in 2023 to 31 last year, surpassing other major investing countries such as Israel, Italy, and the United Kingdom. Altogether, the study has flagged two holding companies, 55 individuals, 34 investors, eighteen partners, seven subsidiaries, 10 suppliers, and four vendors that established themselves in the last year in the spyware marketplace.</p>

<p>This includes new spyware entities in Japan, Malaysia, and Panama, as well as vendors like Israel‚Äôs Bindecy and Italy‚Äôs SIO. ‚ÄúThe quantity of U.S.-based entities investing in the spyware market is three times greater than in the next three highest countries with the most investors,‚Äù the report
said
, adding ‚Äú56% of investors are incorporated in Israel, the United States, Italy, and the United Kingdom.‚Äù
‚ÄúTesellers and brokers now are key actors in the spyware market ‚Äì comprising more sample market share than previously demonstrated ‚Äì and oftentimes are under-observed and not readily addressed in current policy deliberations.‚Äù

<h2 id="new-hybridpetya-ransomware-bypasses-uefi-secure-boot-with-cve-2024-7344-exploit"><a id="article-3"></a>New HybridPetya Ransomware Bypasses UEFI Secure Boot With CVE-2024-7344 Exploit</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new ransomware strain dubbed HybridPetya that resembles the notorious
Petya
/
NotPetya
malware, while also incorporating the ability to bypass the Secure Boot mechanism in Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) systems using a now-patched vulnerability disclosed earlier this year. Slovakian cybersecurity company ESET said the samples were uploaded to the VirusTotal platform in February 2025. ‚ÄúHybridPetya encrypts the
Master File Table
, which contains important metadata about all the files on NTFS-formatted partitions,‚Äù security researcher Martin Smol√°r
said
. ‚ÄúUnlike the original Petya/NotPetya, HybridPetya can compromise modern UEFI-based systems by installing a malicious EFI application onto the EFI System Partition.‚Äù
In other words, the deployed UEFI application is the central component that takes care of encrypting the Master File Table (MFT) file, which contains metadata related to all the files on the NTFS-formatted partition.</p>

<p>HybridPetya comes with two main components: a bootkit and an installer, with the former appearing in two distinct versions. The bootkit, which is deployed by the installer, is chiefly responsible for loading its configuration and checking its encryption status. It can have three different values -
0 - ready for encryption
1 - already encrypted, and
2 - ransom paid, disk decrypted
Should the value be set to 0, it proceeds to set the flag to 1 and encrypts the \EFI\Microsoft\Boot\verify file with the Salsa20 encryption algorithm using the key and nonce specified in the configuration. It also creates a file called ‚Äú\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\counter‚Äù on the EFI System Partition prior to launching the disk encryption process of all NTFS-formatted partitions.</p>

<p>The file is used to keep track of the already encrypted disk clusters. Furthermore, the bootkit updates the fake CHKDSK message displayed on the victim‚Äôs screen with information about the current encryption status, while the victim is deceived into thinking that the system is repairing disk errors. If the bootkit detects that the disk is already encrypted (i.e., the flag is set to 1), it serves a ransom note to the victim, demanding them to send $1,000 in Bitcoin to the specified wallet address (
34UNkKSGZZvf5AYbjkUa2yYYzw89ZLWxu2
). The wallet is currently empty, although it has received $183.32 between February and May 2025.</p>

<p>The ransom note screen also provides an option for the victim to enter the deception key purchased from the operator after making the payment, following which the bootkit verifies the key and attempts to decrypt the ‚ÄúEFI\Microsoft\Boot\verify‚Äù file. In the event the correct key is entered, the flag value is set to 2 and kicks off the decryption step by reading the contents of the ‚Äú\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\counter‚Äù file. ‚ÄúThe decryption stops when the number of decrypted clusters is equal to the value from the counter file,‚Äù Smol√°r said. ‚ÄúDuring the process of MFT decryption, the bootkit shows the current decryption process status.‚Äù
The decryption phase also involves the bootkit recovering the legitimate bootloaders ‚Äì ‚Äú\EFI\Boot\bootx64.efi‚Äù and ‚Äú\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi‚Äù ‚Äì from the backups previously created during the installation process.</p>

<p>Once this step is complete, the victim is prompted to reboot their Windows machine. It‚Äôs worth noting that bootloader changes initiated by the installer during the deployment of the UEFI bootkit component triggers a system crash (aka Blue Screen of Death or BSoD) and ensures that the bootkit binary is executed once the device is turned on. Select variants of HybridPetya, ESET added, have been found to exploit
CVE‚Äë2024‚Äë7344
(CVSS score: 6.7), a remote code execution vulnerability in the Howyar Reloader UEFI application (‚Äúreloader.efi‚Äù, renamed in the artifact as ‚Äú\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi‚Äù) that could result in a Secure Boot bypass. The variant also packs in a specially crafted file named ‚Äúcloak.dat,‚Äù which is loadable through reloader.efi and contains the XORed bootkit binary.</p>

<p>Microsoft has since
revoked
the old, vulnerable binary as part of its
Patch Tuesday update
for January 2025 update. ‚ÄúWhen the reloader.efi binary (deployed as bootmgfw.efi) is executed during boot, it searches for the presence of the cloak.dat file on the EFI System Partition, and loads the embedded UEFI application from the file in a very unsafe way, completely ignoring any integrity checks, thus bypassing UEFI Secure Boot,‚Äù ESET said. Another aspect where HybridPetya and NotPetya differ is that, unlike the latter‚Äôs destructive capabilities, the newly identified artifact allows the threat actors to reconstruct the decryption key from the victim‚Äôs personal installation keys. Telemetry data from ESET indicates no evidence of HybridPetya being used in the wild.</p>

<p>The cybersecurity company also pointed out the
recent discovery
of a
UEFI Petya Proof-of-Concept
(PoC) by security researcher Aleksandra ‚ÄúHasherezade‚Äù Doniec, adding it‚Äôs possible there could be ‚Äúsome relationship between the two cases.‚Äù However, it doesn‚Äôt rule out the possibility that HybridPetya may also be a PoC. ‚ÄúHybridPetya is now at least the fourth publicly known example of a real or proof-of-concept UEFI bootkit with UEFI Secure Boot bypass functionality, joining
BlackLotus
(exploiting CVE‚Äë2022‚Äë21894),
BootKitty
(exploiting LogoFail), and the
Hyper-V Backdoor PoC
(exploiting CVE‚Äë2020‚Äë26200),‚Äù ESET said. ‚ÄúThis shows that Secure Boot bypasses are not just possible ‚Äì they‚Äôre becoming more common and attractive to both researchers and attackers.‚Äù

<h2 id="critical-cve-2025-5086-in-delmia-apriso-actively-exploited-cisa-issues-warning"><a id="article-4"></a>Critical CVE-2025-5086 in DELMIA Apriso Actively Exploited, CISA Issues Warning</h2>

<p>The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Thursday
added
a critical security flaw impacting Dassault Syst√®mes
DELMIA Apriso
Manufacturing Operations Management (MOM) software to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (
KEV
) catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. The vulnerability, tracked as
CVE-2025-5086
, carries a CVSS score of 9.0 out of 10.0. According to Dassault, the issue
impacts
versions from Release 2020 through Release 2025.</p>

<p>‚ÄúDassault Syst√®mes DELMIA Apriso contains a deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability that could lead to a remote code execution,‚Äù the agency said in an advisory. The addition of CVE-2025-5086 to the KEV catalog comes after the SANS Internet Storm Center
reported
seeing exploitation attempts targeting the flaw that originate from the IP address
156.244.33[.]162
, which geolocates to Mexico. The attacks involve sending an HTTP request to the ‚Äú/apriso/WebServices/FlexNetOperationsService.svc/Invoke‚Äù endpoint with a Base64-encoded payload that decodes to a GZIP-compressed Windows executable (‚Äú
fwitxz01.dll
‚Äú), Johannes B. Ullrich, the dean of research at the SANS Technology Institute, said.</p>

<p>Kaspersky has flagged the DLL as ‚ÄúTrojan.MSIL.Zapchast.gen,‚Äù which the company
describes
as a malicious program designed to electronically spy on a user‚Äôs activities, including capturing keyboard input, taking screenshots, and gathering a list of active applications, among others. ‚ÄúThe collected information is sent to the cybercriminal by various means, including email, FTP, and HTTP (by sending data in a request),‚Äù the Russian cybersecurity vendor added. Zapchast variants, according to
Bitdefender
and
Trend Micro
, have been distributed via phishing emails bearing malicious attachments for over a decade. It‚Äôs currently not clear if ‚ÄúTrojan.MSIL.Zapchast.gen‚Äù is an improved version of the same malware.</p>

<p>In light of active exploitation, Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies are advised to apply the necessary updates by October 2, 2025, to secure their networks. Found this article interesting? Follow us on

<h2 id="cloud-native-security-in-2025-why-runtime-visibility-must-take-center-stage"><a id="article-5"></a>Cloud-Native Security in 2025: Why Runtime Visibility Must Take Center Stage</h2>

<p>The security landscape for cloud-native applications is undergoing a profound transformation. Containers, Kubernetes, and serverless technologies are now the default for modern enterprises, accelerating delivery but also expanding the attack surface in ways traditional security models can‚Äôt keep up with. As adoption grows, so does complexity. Security teams are asked to monitor sprawling hybrid environments, sift through thousands of alerts, and protect dynamic applications that evolve multiple times per day.</p>

<p>The question isn‚Äôt just how to detect risks earlier ‚Äî it‚Äôs how to prioritize and respond to what really matters in real time. That‚Äôs where cloud-native application protection platforms (CNAPPs) come into play. These platforms consolidate visibility, compliance, detection, and response into a unified system. But in 2025, one capability is proving indispensable:
runtime visibility.</p>

<p>The New Center of Gravity: Runtime
For years, cloud security has leaned heavily on preventative controls like code scanning, configuration checks, and compliance enforcement. While essential, these measures provide only part of the picture. They identify theoretical risks, but not whether those risks are
active and exploitable in production. Runtime visibility fills that gap.</p>

<p>By observing what workloads are actually running ‚Äî and how they behave ‚Äî security teams gain the highest fidelity signal for prioritizing threats. Runtime context answers critical questions:
Is this vulnerability reachable in a live workload? Is this misconfiguration creating a real attack path? Is this workload being exploited right now?</p>

<p>Without runtime, organizations risk chasing false positives while attackers exploit real weaknesses. With runtime, teams can focus on fixing the issues that matter most, reducing both noise and exposure. From Prevention to Prioritization
Modern enterprises face an avalanche of alerts across vulnerability scanners, cloud posture tools, and application security platforms. The volume isn‚Äôt just overwhelming ‚Äî it‚Äôs unsustainable.</p>

<p>Analysts often spend more time triaging alerts than actually fixing problems. To be effective, organizations must map vulnerabilities and misconfigurations to:
The workloads that are actively running. The business applications they support. The teams responsible for fixing them.</p>

<p>This alignment is critical for bridging the gap between security and development. Developers often see security findings as disruptive, low-context interruptions. Security teams, meanwhile, lack the visibility into ownership and accountability that‚Äôs needed to drive remediation. By grounding prioritization in runtime insights, enterprises can ensure that the
right teams fix the right problems at the right time.</p>

<p>The Role of AI in Cloud Security
Even with better prioritization, the sheer scale and complexity of cloud environments challenge human teams. This is where artificial intelligence is beginning to reshape the CNAPP landscape. AI can help by:
Correlating signals across domains. Seemingly unrelated events in logs, network traffic, and workload behavior can reveal emerging attack campaigns.</p>

<p>Reducing false positives. Pattern recognition and large language models can identify which alerts are truly actionable. Accelerating response. Automated reasoning can suggest remediation steps or even take action in low-risk scenarios.</p>

<p>At Sysdig, we‚Äôve seen how AI can serve as a force multiplier for security teams. Our own AI security analyst, Sysdig Sage‚Ñ¢, uses multi-step reasoning to analyze complex attack patterns and surface insights that traditional tools miss. For overburdened security operations centers (SOCs), this means faster detection and shorter mean time to resolution (MTTR). The takeaway: AI isn‚Äôt replacing security teams, but it is reshaping how they operate ‚Äî by filtering noise, enriching context, and enabling smarter, faster decisions.</p>

<p>Accountability and Collaboration
Another challenge enterprises face is accountability. Security findings are only valuable if they reach the right owner with the right context. Yet in many organizations, vulnerabilities are reported without clarity about which team should fix them. This is why mapping findings back to code artifacts, ownership, and deployment context is critical.</p>

<p>It ensures that vulnerabilities discovered in production can be traced back to the team that introduced them. Security becomes a shared responsibility, not a siloed burden. Partnerships and integrations play a key role here. For example,
Sysdig‚Äôs collaboration with Semgrep
enables organizations to connect runtime vulnerabilities to their originating source code, reducing the back-and-forth between teams and streamlining remediation.</p>

<p>Why Consolidation Is Inevitable
Enterprises have long relied on best-of-breed security tools. But in the cloud, fragmentation becomes a liability. Multiple point products generate duplicate findings, lack shared context, and increase operational overhead. CNAPP represents the next stage of consolidation.</p>

<p>By unifying vulnerability management, posture assessment, threat detection, and incident response into a single platform, organizations can:
Eliminate silos. Reduce tool sprawl. Gain a single source of truth for cloud risk. And most importantly, they can tie everything back to runtime, ensuring that real-world threats are never lost in the noise.</p>

<p>Preparing for What‚Äôs Next
The rise of containers and cloud-native applications shows no sign of slowing. In fact, by the end of the decade, containers are expected to power half of all enterprise applications. With this growth comes pressure for security teams to adopt strategies that scale, simplify, and automate. The future of cloud security will be defined by three priorities:
Runtime-powered visibility
to cut through noise and focus on real risk.</p>

<p>AI-driven assistance
to help teams triage, prioritize, and respond at machine speed. Unified platforms
that consolidate fragmented tools into a single, contextual view of cloud risk. Enterprises that embrace this model will be positioned to move faster, reduce exposure, and stay ahead of attackers. Those who cling to disconnected tools and reactive processes will find themselves increasingly outpaced.</p>

<p>Secure What Matters, When It Matters
The cloud has redefined how businesses build and run applications. It‚Äôs now redefining how they must secure them. Runtime visibility, AI-driven prioritization, and unified platforms are no longer optional ‚Äî they‚Äôre essential. At
Sysdig
, we believe the future of cloud security is rooted in real-time context and collaboration.</p>

<p>By focusing on what‚Äôs actively happening in production, organizations can align security and development, reduce false positives, and respond to threats with confidence. The message is clear:
stop chasing every alert and start focusing on what matters most. To explore these trends in greater depth, download the full

<h2 id="cursor-ai-code-editor-flaw-enables-silent-code-execution-via-malicious-repositories"><a id="article-6"></a>Cursor AI Code Editor Flaw Enables Silent Code Execution via Malicious Repositories</h2>

<p>A security weakness has been disclosed in the artificial intelligence (AI)-powered code editor
Cursor
that could trigger code execution when a maliciously crafted repository is opened using the program. The issue stems from the fact that an out-of-the-box security setting is disabled by default, opening the door for attackers to run arbitrary code on users‚Äô computers with their privileges. ‚ÄúCursor ships with Workspace Trust disabled by default, so VS Code-style tasks configured with runOptions.runOn: ‚ÄòfolderOpen‚Äô auto-execute the moment a developer browses a project,‚Äù Oasis Security
said
in an analysis. ‚ÄúA malicious .vscode/tasks.json turns a casual ‚Äòopen folder‚Äô into silent code execution in the user‚Äôs context.‚Äù
Cursor is an AI-powered fork of Visual Studio Code, which supports a feature called
Workspace Trust
to allow developers to safely browse and edit code regardless of where it came from or who wrote it.</p>

<p>With this option disabled, an attacker can make available a project in GitHub (or any platform) and include a hidden ‚Äúautorun‚Äù instruction that instructs the IDE to execute a task as soon as a folder is opened, causing malicious code to be executed when the victim attempts to browse the booby-trapped repository in Cursor. ‚ÄúThis has the potential to leak sensitive credentials, modify files, or serve as a vector for broader system compromise, placing Cursor users at significant risk from supply chain attacks,‚Äù Oasis Security researcher Erez Schwartz said. To counter this threat, users are advised to enable Workplace Trust in Cursor, open untrusted repositories in a different code editor, and audit them before opening them in the tool. The development comes as
prompt injections and jailbreaks
have
emerged
as a stealthy and systemic threat plaguing AI-powered coding and reasoning agents like Claude Code,
Cline
,
K2 Think
, and
Windsurf
, allowing threat actors to
embed
malicious instructions in
sneaky ways
to trick the systems into performing malicious actions or leaking data from software development environments.</p>

<p>Software supply chain security outfit Checkmarx, in a report last week, revealed how Anthropic‚Äôs newly introduced
automated security reviews
in Claude Code could inadvertently expose projects to security risks, including instructing it to ignore vulnerable code through prompt injections, causing developers to push malicious or insecure code past security reviews. ‚ÄúIn this case, a carefully written comment can convince Claude that even plainly dangerous code is completely safe,‚Äù the company
said
. ‚ÄúThe end result: a developer ‚Äì whether malicious or just trying to shut Claude up ‚Äì can easily trick Claude into thinking a vulnerability is safe.‚Äù
Another problem is that the AI inspection process also generates and executes test cases, which could lead to a scenario where malicious code is run against production databases if Claude Code isn‚Äôt properly sandboxed. The AI company, which also recently
launched
a new file creation and editing feature in Claude, has warned that the feature carries prompt injection risks due to it running in a ‚Äúsandboxed computing environment with limited internet access.‚Äù
Specifically, it‚Äôs possible for a bad actor to ‚Äúinconspicuously‚Äù add instructions via external files or websites ‚Äì aka indirect prompt injection ‚Äì that trick the chatbot into downloading and running untrusted code or reading sensitive data from a knowledge source connected via the Model Context Protocol (
MCP
).</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis means Claude can be tricked into sending information from its context (e.g., prompts, projects, data via MCP, Google integrations) to malicious third parties,‚Äù Anthropic
said
. ‚ÄúTo mitigate these risks, we recommend you monitor Claude while using the feature and stop it if you see it using or accessing data unexpectedly.‚Äù
That‚Äôs not all. Late last month, the company also revealed browser-using AI models like Claude for Chrome can face prompt injection attacks, and that it has implemented several defenses to address the threat and reduce the attack success rate of 23.6% to 11.2%. ‚ÄúNew forms of prompt injection attacks are also constantly being developed by malicious actors,‚Äù it
added
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBy uncovering real-world examples of unsafe behavior and new attack patterns that aren‚Äôt present in controlled tests, we‚Äôll teach our models to recognize the attacks and account for the related behaviors, and ensure that safety classifiers will pick up anything that the model itself misses.‚Äù
At the same time, these tools have also been found susceptible to traditional security vulnerabilities, broadening the attack surface with potential real-world impact -
A WebSocket authentication bypass in
Claude Code IDE extensions
(
CVE-2025-52882
, CVSS score: 8.8) that could have allowed an attacker to connect to a victim‚Äôs unauthenticated local WebSocket server simply by luring them to visit a website under their control, enabling remote command execution
An SQL injection vulnerability in the
Postgres MCP server
that could have allowed an attacker to bypass the read-only restriction and execute arbitrary SQL statements
A path traversal vulnerability in
Microsoft NLWeb
that could have allowed a remote attacker to read sensitive files, including system configurations (‚Äú/etc/passwd‚Äù) and cloud credentials (.env files), using a specially crafted URL
An incorrect authorization vulnerability in
Lovable
(CVE-2025-48757, CVSS score: 9.3) that could have allowed remote unauthenticated attackers to read or write to arbitrary database tables of generated sites
Open redirect, stored cross-site scripting (XSS), and sensitive data leakage vulnerabilities in
Base44
that could have allowed attackers to access the victim‚Äôs apps and development workspace, harvest API keys, inject malicious logic into user-generated applications, and exfiltrate data
A vulnerability in
Ollama Desktop
arising as a result of incomplete cross-origin controls that could have allowed an attacker to stage a drive-by attack, where visiting a malicious website can reconfigure the application‚Äôs settings to intercept chats and even alter responses using poisoned models
‚ÄúAs AI-driven development accelerates, the most pressing threats are often not exotic AI attacks but failures in classical security controls,‚Äù Imperva said. ‚ÄúTo protect the growing ecosystem of ‚Äòvibe coding‚Äô platforms, security must be treated as a foundation, not an afterthought.‚Äù

has been added to Pixel Camera and Google Photos apps for Android. The move, Google said, is designed to further digital media transparency. C2PA‚Äôs Content Credentials are a tamper-evident, cryptographically signed digital manifest providing verifiable provenance for digital content such as images, videos, or audio files.</p>

<p>The metadata type, according to
Adobe
, serves as a ‚Äúdigital nutrition label,‚Äù giving information about the creator, how it was made, and if it was generated using artificial intelligence (AI). ‚ÄúThe Pixel Camera app achieved Assurance Level 2, the highest security rating currently defined by the C2PA Conformance Program,‚Äù Google‚Äôs Android Security and C2PA Core teams
said
. ‚ÄúAssurance Level 2 for a mobile app is currently only possible on the Android platform.‚Äù
‚ÄúPixel 10 phones support on-device trusted time-stamps, which ensures images captured with your native camera app can be trusted after the certificate expires, even if they were captured when your device was offline.‚Äù
The capability is made possible using a combination of Google Tensor G5, Titan M2 security chip, and hardware-backed security features built into the Android operating system. Google said it has implemented C2PA to be secure, verifiable, and usable offline, thereby ensuring that provenance data is trustworthy, the process is not personally identifiable, and works even when the device is not connected to the internet.</p>

<p>This is achieved using -
Android Key Attestation
to allow Google C2PA Certification Authorities (CAs) to verify that they are communicating with a genuine physical device
Hardware-backed Android Key Attestation certificates that include the package name and signing certificates associated with the app that requested the generation of the C2PA signing key to verify the request originated from a trusted, registered app
Generating and storing C2PA claim signing keys using Android StrongBox in the Titan M2 security chip for tamper-resistance
Anonymous, hardware-backed attestation to certify new cryptographic keys generated on-device without knowing who is using it
Unique certificates to sign each image, making it ‚Äúcryptographically impossible‚Äù to deanonymize the creator
On-device, offline Time-Stamping Authority (TSA) component within the Tensor chip to generate cryptographically-signed time-stamps when the camera‚Äôs shutter is pressed
‚ÄúC2PA Content Credentials are not the sole solution for identifying the provenance of digital media,‚Äù Google said. ‚ÄúThey are, however, a tangible step toward more media transparency and trust as we continue to unlock more human creativity with AI.‚Äù

<h2 id="senator-wyden-urges-ftc-to-probe-microsoft-for-ransomware-linked-cybersecurity-negligence"><a id="article-8"></a>Senator Wyden Urges FTC to Probe Microsoft for Ransomware-Linked Cybersecurity Negligence</h2>

<p>U.S. Senator Ron Wyden has called on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to probe Microsoft and hold it responsible for what he called ‚Äúgross cybersecurity negligence‚Äù that enabled ransomware attacks on U.S. critical infrastructure, including against healthcare networks. ‚ÄúWithout timely action, Microsoft‚Äôs culture of negligent cybersecurity, combined with its de facto monopolization of the enterprise operating system market, poses a serious national security threat and makes additional hacks inevitable,‚Äù Wyden
wrote
in a four-page letter to FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson, likening Redmond to an ‚Äúarsonist selling firefighting services to their victims.‚Äù
The development comes after Wyden‚Äôs office obtained new information from healthcare system Ascension, which
suffered
a crippling
ransomware attack
last year, resulting in the theft of personal and medical information associated with
nearly 5.6 million individuals
.</p>

<p>The ransomware attack, which also disrupted access to electronic health records, was attributed to a ransomware group known as Black Basta. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the breach has been ranked as the
third-largest healthcare-related incident
over the past year. According to the senator‚Äôs office, the breach occurred when a contractor clicked on a malicious link after conducting a web search on Microsoft‚Äôs Bing search engine, causing their system to be infected with malware.</p>

<p>Subsequently, the attackers leveraged ‚Äúdangerously insecure default settings‚Äù on Microsoft software to obtain elevated access to the most sensitive parts of Ascension‚Äôs network. This involved the use of a technique called
Kerberoasting
that targets the Kerberos authentication protocol to extract encrypted service account credentials from Active Directory. Kerberoasting ‚Äúexploits an insecure encryption technology from the 1980s known as ‚ÄòRC4‚Äô that is still supported by Microsoft software in its default configuration,‚Äù Wyden‚Äôs office said, adding it urged Microsoft to warn customers about the threat posed by the threat on July 29, 2024. RC4
, short for Rivest Cipher 4, is a stream cipher that was first developed in 1987.</p>

<p>Originally intended to be a trade secret, it was leaked in a public forum in 1994. As of 2015, the Engineering Task Force (ETF) has
prohibited
the use of RC4 in TLS, citing a ‚Äúvariety of cryptographic weaknesses‚Äù that allow plaintext recovery. Eventually, Microsoft did
publish
an alert in October 2024 outlining the steps users can take to stay protected, in addition to stating its plans to deprecate support for RC4 as a future update to Windows 11 24H2 and Windows Server 2025 -
The accounts most vulnerable to Kerberoasting are those with weak passwords and those that use weaker encryption algorithms, especially RC4. RC4 is more susceptible to the cyberattack because it uses no salt or iterated hash when converting a password to an encryption key, allowing the cyberthreat actor to guess more passwords quickly.</p>

<p>However, other encryption algorithms are still vulnerable when weak passwords are used. While AD will not try to use RC4 by default, RC4 is currently enabled by default, meaning a cyberthreat actor can attempt to request tickets encrypted using RC4. RC4 will be deprecated, and we intend to disable it by default in a future update to Windows 11 24H2 and Windows Server 2025. Microsoft, which
removed support
for the Data Encryption Standard (DES) in Kerberos for Windows Server 2025 and Windows 11, version 24H2 earlier this February, said it has also
introduced
security improvements in Server 2025 that prevent the Kerberos Distribution Center from issuing Ticket Granting Tickets using RC4 encryption, such as RC4-HMAC(NT).</p>

<p>Some of Microsoft‚Äôs recommended mitigations to harden environments against Kerberoasting attacks include -
Using Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA) or Delegated Managed Service Accounts (dMSA) wherever possible
Securing service accounts by setting randomly generated, long passwords that are at least 14 characters long
Making sure all service accounts are configured to use AES (128 and 256 bit) for Kerberos service ticket encryption
Auditing user accounts with Service Principal Names (SPNs)
However, Wyden wrote that Microsoft‚Äôs software does not enforce a 14-character password length for privileged accounts, and that the company‚Äôs continued support for the insecure RC4 encryption technology ‚Äúneedlessly exposes‚Äù its customers to ransomware and other cyber threats by allowing attackers to crack the passwords of privileged accounts. When reached for comment, Microsoft shared the below statement with The Hacker News -
RC4 is an old standard, and we discourage its use both in how we engineer our software and in our documentation to customers ‚Äì which is why it makes up less than 0.1% of our traffic. However, disabling its use completely would break many customer systems. For this reason, we‚Äôre on a path to gradually reduce the extent to which customers can use it, while providing strong warnings against it and advice for using it in the safest ways possible.</p>

<p>We have it on our roadmap to ultimately disable its use. We‚Äôve engaged with The Senator‚Äôs office on this issue and will continue to listen and answer questions from them or others in government. The company noted that any new installations of Active Directory Domains using Windows Server 2025 will have RC4 disabled by default starting Q1 of 2026, adding new domains will inherently be protected against attacks relying on RC4 weaknesses. It also said it plans to include additional mitigations for existing in-market deployments keeping compatibility and continuity of critical customer services in mind.</p>

<p>This is not the first time the Windows maker has been blasted for its cybersecurity practices. In a report released last year, U.S. Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB)
lambasted
the company for a series of avoidable errors that could have prevented Chinese threat actors known as Storm-0558 from compromising the Microsoft Exchange Online mailboxes of 22 organizations and over 500 individuals around the world. ‚ÄúUltimately, Microsoft‚Äôs abysmal cybersecurity track record has had no impact on its lucrative federal contracts thanks to its dominant market position and inaction by government agencies in the face of the company‚Äôs string of security failures,‚Äù Wyden‚Äôs office argued.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe letter underscores a long-standing tension in enterprise cybersecurity, the balance between legacy system support and secure-by-default design,‚Äù Ensar Seker, CISO at SOCRadar, said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about systemic risk inherited from default configurations and the architectural complexity of widely adopted software ecosystems like Microsoft‚Äôs. When a single vendor becomes foundational to national infrastructure, their security design decisions, or lack thereof, can have cascading consequences.‚Äù
‚ÄúUltimately, this isn‚Äôt about blaming one company. It‚Äôs about recognizing that national security is now tightly coupled with the configuration defaults of dominant IT platforms.</p>

<p>Enterprises and public sector agencies alike need to demand more secure-by-design defaults and be ready to adapt when they‚Äôre offered.‚Äù
(The story was updated after publication to include a response from Microsoft.)

<h2 id="cracking-the-boardroom-code-helping-cisos-speak-the-language-of-business"><a id="article-9"></a>Cracking the Boardroom Code: Helping CISOs Speak the Language of Business</h2>

<p>CISOs know their field. They understand the threat landscape. They understand how to build a strong and cost-effective security stack. They understand how to staff out their organization.</p>

<p>They understand the intricacies of compliance. They understand what it takes to reduce risk. Yet one question comes up again and again in our conversations with these security leaders:
how do I make the impact of risk clear to business decision-makers? Boards want to hear how risk affects revenue, governance, and growth.</p>

<p>They have a limited attention span for lists of vulnerabilities or technical details. When the story gets too technical, even urgent initiatives lose traction and fail to get funded. CISOs need to translate technical issues into terms the board understands. Doing so builds trust, garners support and shows how security decisions connect directly to long-term growth.</p>

<p>It was the urgent need to bridge the CISO-Board communication gap that led us to create a new paradigm in CISO continuing education:
Risk Reporting to the Board for Modern CISOs
. The Disconnect Between Boards and CISOs
Boards are increasingly held accountable for cyber risk. SEC rules
require public companies to disclose cyber incidents within four business days and to describe board cyber oversight in annual reports. In the EU,
NIS2
holds management bodies directly responsible for cybersecurity measures, with penalties up to ‚Ç¨10 million or 2% of global turnover.</p>

<p>Boards track governance, liability, and enterprise value. CISOs present threats, vulnerabilities, and controls. Surveys confirm this gap:
Gartner‚Äôs 2024 Board of Directors Survey
reports that 84% of directors classify cybersecurity as a business risk, yet research finds that only about half of boards rate their understanding as strong enough for effective oversight. CISO-Board alignment has never been more important, but the two sides still speak different languages.</p>

<p>This challenge surfaced so often in our conversations with security leaders that it led us to a simple conclusion: if so many experienced professionals need this skill,
it should be taught. Teaching How to Close the Boardroom Gap
The goal was clear: boards need insights that connect cyber risk to business outcomes. Risk Reporting to the Board for Modern CISOs
was built from scratch to help security leaders meet that need. The course teaches CISOs how to reframe their message in ways that resonate with directors.</p>

<p>It focuses on practical skills: moving beyond vanity metrics to dashboards that answer the ‚ÄúSo what?‚Äù question, building concise presentations that boards can act on, anticipating and managing difficult questions, and framing budget requests in financial and strategic terms. The course also introduces Continuous Threat Exposure Management as a model for presenting risk in a structured, forward-looking way. Each of the five lessons is designed to be practical and easy to apply. Participants leave with methods and templates they can use in their next board meeting.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>The key areas of focus include:</dt>
  <dt>The Board‚Äôs View of Risk</dt>
  <dd>What directors focus on and how to frame security as an enabler of safe innovation and competitive advantage. Clear Risk Communication</dd>
  <dd>Moving past vanity metrics by building dashboards that tell a risk story that ties technical findings to business impact. High-Impact Presentations</dd>
  <dd>Creating concise, effective board presentations, aligning with key executives in advance, and handling difficult questions with confidence. Stronger Business Cases</dd>
  <dd>Translating security needs into financial and strategic language.</dd>
  <dt>Building requests around risk reduction value, total cost of ownership, and alignment with company objectives. Operationalizing CTEM</dt>
  <dd>Applying the five stages of Continuous Threat Exposure Management to strengthen security posture and structure reporting in a forward-looking way. The course is led by Dr. Gerald Auger, whose career spans more than twenty years in both industry and academia.</dd>
</dl>

<p>He served as cybersecurity architect for a major medical center and has taught tens of thousands of students through his Simply Cyber platform. His mix of practical and teaching experience makes the course grounded, relevant, and directly useful for CISOs in the boardroom. The Bottom Line
Cybersecurity is at the center of business oversight. Boards expect insight that is clear and actionable, and CISOs need to present risk in terms that connect directly to governance, finance, and strategy.</p>

<p>Risk Reporting to the Board for Modern CISOs
was designed with these challenges in mind. The course gives security leaders practical tools to translate their expertise into language the board can act on. When CISOs build these skills, they move from talking about technical metrics to explaining risk in terms that link to business goals and show how security drives long-term growth. That leads to clearer conversations with directors, steadier support for security programs, and a stronger role for cybersecurity in the company‚Äôs overall strategy.</p>

<h2 id="sonicwall-ssl-vpn-flaw-and-misconfigurations-actively-exploited-by-akira-ransomware-hackers"><a id="article-10"></a>SonicWall SSL VPN Flaw and Misconfigurations Actively Exploited by Akira Ransomware Hackers</h2>

<p>Threat actors affiliated with the Akira ransomware group have continued to target SonicWall devices for initial access. Cybersecurity firm Rapid7
said
it observed a spike in intrusions involving SonicWall appliances over the past month, particularly
following reports
about renewed Akira ransomware activity since late July 2025. SonicWall subsequently
revealed
the SSL VPN activity aimed at its firewalls involved a year-old security flaw (
CVE-2024-40766
, CVSS score: 9.3) where local user passwords were carried over during the migration and not reset. ‚ÄúWe are observing increased threat activity from actors attempting to brute-force user credentials,‚Äù the company
noted
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúTo mitigate risk, customers should enable Botnet Filtering to block known threat actors and ensure Account Lockout policies are enabled.‚Äù
SonicWall has also
urged
users to review LDAP SSL VPN Default User Groups, describing it as a ‚Äúcritical weak point‚Äù if misconfigured in the context of an Akira ransomware attack ‚Äì
This setting automatically adds every successfully authenticated LDAP user to a predefined local group, regardless of their actual membership in Active Directory. If that default group has access to sensitive services ‚Äì such as SSL VPN, administrative interfaces, or unrestricted network zones ‚Äì then any compromised AD account, even one with no legitimate need for those services, will instantly inherit those permissions. This effectively bypasses intended AD group-based access controls, giving attackers a direct path into the network perimeter as soon as they obtain valid credentials. Rapid7, in its alert, said it has also observed threat actors accessing the Virtual Office Portal hosted by SonicWall appliances, which, in certain default configurations, can facilitate public access and enable attackers to configure mMFA/TOTP with valid accounts, assuming there is a prior credential exposure.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe Akira group is potentially utilizing a combination of all three of these security risks to gain unauthorized access and conduct ransomware operations,‚Äù it said. To mitigate the risk, organizations are advised to rotate passwords on all SonicWall local accounts, remove any unused or inactive SonicWall local accounts, ensure MFA/TOTP policies are configured, and restrict Virtual Office Portal access to the internal network. Akira‚Äôs targeting of SonicWall SSL VPNs has also been
echoed
by the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), which acknowledged it‚Äôs aware of the ransomware gang striking vulnerable Australian organizations through the devices. Since its debut in March 2023,
Akira
has been a persistent threat in the ransomware threat landscape, claiming 967 victims to date, as per information from
Ransomware.Live
.</p>

<p>According to statistics
shared
by CYFIRMA, Akira accounted for 40 attacks in the month of July 2025, making it the third most active group after Qilin and INC Ransom. Of the 657 ransomware attacks impacting industrial entities worldwide flagged in Q2 2025, Qilin, Akira, and Play ransomware families took the top three slots, each reporting 101, 79, and 75 incidents, respectively. Akira maintained ‚Äúsubstantial activity with consistent targeting of manufacturing and transportation sectors through sophisticated phishing and multi-platform ransomware deployments,‚Äù industrial cybersecurity company Dragos
said
in a report published last month. Recent Akira ransomware infections have also
leveraged
search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning techniques to deliver trojanized installers for popular IT management tools, which are then used to drop the Bumblebee malware loader.</p>

<p>The attacks then utilize Bumblebee as a conduit to distribute the AdaptixC2 post-exploitation and adversarial emulation framework, install RustDesk for persistent remote access, exfiltrate data, and deploy the ransomware. According to
Palo Alto Networks Unit 42
, the versatile and modular nature of AdaptixC2 can allow threat actors to execute commands, transfer files, and perform data exfiltration on infected systems. The fact that it‚Äôs also open-source means it can be customized by adversaries to fit their needs. Other campaigns propagating AdaptixC2, the cybersecurity company said, have used
Microsoft Teams calls
mimicking IT help desk to trick unsuspecting users into granting them remote access via Quick Assist and drop a PowerShell script that decrypts and loads into memory the shellcode payload.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe Akira ransomware group follows a standard attack flow: obtaining initial access via the SSLVPN component, escalating privileges to an elevated account or service account, locating and stealing sensitive files from network shares or file servers, deleting or stopping backups, and deploying ransomware encryption at the hypervisor level,‚Äù Rapid7 said.

<h2 id="fake-madgicx-plus-and-socialmetrics-extensions-are-hijacking-meta-business-accounts"><a id="article-11"></a>Fake Madgicx Plus and SocialMetrics Extensions Are Hijacking Meta Business Accounts</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed two new campaigns that are serving fake browser extensions using malicious ads and fake websites to steal sensitive data. The malvertising campaign, per
Bitdefender
, is designed to push fake ‚Äú
Meta Verified
‚Äú browser extensions named
SocialMetrics Pro
that claim to unlock the blue check badge for Facebook and Instagram profiles. At least 37 malicious ads have been observed serving the extension in question. ‚ÄúThe malicious ads are bundled with a video tutorial that guides viewers through the process of downloading and installing a so-called browser extension, which claims to unlock the blue verification tick on Facebook or other special features,‚Äù the Romanian cybersecurity vendor said.</p>

<p>But, in reality, the extension ‚Äì which is hosted on a legitimate cloud service called Box ‚Äì is capable of collecting session cookies from Facebook and sending them to a Telegram bot controlled by the attackers. It‚Äôs also equipped to obtain the victim‚Äôs IP address by sending a query to ipinfo[.]io/json. Select variants of the rogue browser add-on have been observed using the stolen cookies to interact with the Facebook Graph API to likely fetch additional information related to the accounts. In the past, malware like
NodeStealer
has leveraged the Facebook Graph API to collect budget details of the account.</p>

<p>The end goal of these efforts is to sell valuable Facebook Business and Ads accounts on underground forums for profit to other fraudsters, or repurpose them to fuel more malvertising campaigns, which, in turn, leads to more hijacked accounts ‚Äì effectively creating a self-perpetuating cycle. The campaign exhibits all the ‚Äúfingerprints‚Äù typically associated with
Vietnamese-speaking
threat actors, who are
known
to
adopt
various
stealer families
to target and gain unauthorized access to Facebook accounts. This hypothesis is also bolstered by the use of Vietnamese to narrate the tutorial and add source code comments. ‚ÄúBy using a trusted platform, attackers can mass-generate links, automatically embed them into tutorials, and continuously refresh their campaigns,‚Äù Bitdefender said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis fits a larger pattern of attackers industrializing malvertising, where everything from ad images to tutorials is created en masse.‚Äù
The disclosure coincides with another campaign that‚Äôs targeting Meta advertisers with rogue Chrome extensions distributed via counterfeit websites posing as artificial intelligence (AI)-powered ad optimization tools for Facebook and Instagram. At the heart of the operation is a fake platform named
Madgicx Plus
. ‚ÄúPromoted as a tool to streamline campaign management and boost ROI using artificial intelligence, the extension instead delivers potentially malicious functionalities capable of hijacking business sessions, stealing credentials, and compromising Meta Business accounts,‚Äù Cybereason
said
. ‚ÄúThe extensions are promoted as productivity or ad performance enhancers, but they operate as dual-purpose malware capable of stealing credentials, accessing session tokens, or enabling account takeover.</p>

<p>The extensions, the first of which is still available for download from the Chrome Web Store as of writing, are listed below -
Madgicx Plus - The SuperApp for Meta Advertisers (ID:
eoalbaojjblgndkffciljmiddhgjdldh
) - Published in February 2025 (28 Installs)
Meta Ads SuperTool (ID:
cpigbbjhchinhpamicodkkcpihjjjlia
) - Published in March 2025 (11 Installs)
Madgicx X Ads - The SuperApp for Meta Advertisers (ID:
cpigbbjhchinhpamicodkkcpihjjjlia
) - Published in March 2025 (3 Installs)
Once installed, the extension gains full access to all websites the user visits, enabling the threat actors to inject arbitrary scripts, as well as intercept and modify network traffic, monitor browsing activity, capture form inputs, and harvest sensitive data. It also prompts users to link their Facebook and Google accounts to access the service, while their identity information is covertly harvested in the background. Furthermore, the add-ons function similarly to the aforementioned fake Meta Verified extension in that it uses victims‚Äô stolen Facebook credentials to interact with the Facebook Graph API. ‚ÄúThis staged approach reveals a clear threat-actor strategy: first capturing Google identity data, then pivoting to Facebook to broaden access and increase the chances of hijacking valuable business or advertising assets,‚Äù Cybereason said.</p>

<h2 id="asyncrat-exploits-connectwise-screenconnect-to-steal-credentials-and-crypto"><a id="article-12"></a>AsyncRAT Exploits ConnectWise ScreenConnect to Steal Credentials and Crypto</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a new campaign that leverages ConnectWise ScreenConnect, a legitimate Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) software, to deliver a fleshless loader that drops a remote access trojan (RAT) called
AsyncRAT
to steal sensitive data from compromised hosts. ‚ÄúThe attacker used ScreenConnect to gain remote access, then executed a layered VBScript and PowerShell loader that fetched and ran obfuscated components from external URLs,‚Äù LevelBlue
said
in a report shared with The Hacker News. ‚ÄúThese components included encoded .NET assemblies ultimately unpacking into AsyncRAT while maintaining persistence via a fake ‚ÄòSkype Updater‚Äô scheduled task.‚Äù
In the infection chain documented by the cybersecurity company, the threat actors have been found to leverage a ScreenConnect deployment to initiate a remote session and launch a Visual Basic Script payload via hands-on-keyboard activity. ‚ÄúWe saw trojanized ScreenConnect installers masquerading as financial and other business documents being sent via phishing emails,‚Äù Sean Shirley, LevelBlue MDR SOC Analyst, told The Hacker News.</p>

<p>The script, for its part, is designed to retrieve two external payloads (‚Äúlogs.ldk‚Äù and ‚Äúlogs.ldr‚Äù) from an attacker-controlled server by means of a PowerShell script. The first of the two files, ‚Äúlogs.ldk,‚Äù is a DLL that‚Äôs responsible for writing a secondary Visual Basic Script to disk, using it to establish persistence using a scheduled task by passing it off as ‚ÄúSkype Updater‚Äù to evade detection. This Visual Basic Script contains the same PowerShell logic observed at the start of the attack. The scheduled task ensures that the payload is automatically executed after every login.</p>

<p>The PowerShell script, besides loading ‚Äúlogs.ldk‚Äù as a .NET assembly, passes ‚Äúlogs.ldr‚Äù as input to the loaded assembly, leading to the execution of a binary (‚ÄúAsyncClient.exe‚Äù), which is the AsyncRAT payload with capabilities to log keystrokes, steal browser credentials , fingerprint the system, and scan for installed cryptocurrency wallet desktop apps and browser extensions in Google Chrome, Brave, Microsoft Edge, Opera, and Mozilla Firefox. All this collected information is eventually exfiltrated to a command-and-control (C2) server (‚Äú3osch20.duckdns[.]org‚Äù) over a TCP socket, to which the malware beacons in order to execute payloads and receive post-exploitation commands. The C2 connection settings are either hard-coded or pulled from a remote Pastebin URL. ‚ÄúFileless malware continues to pose a significant challenge to modern cybersecurity defenses due to its stealthy nature and reliance on legitimate system tools for execution,‚Äù LevelBlue said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúUnlike traditional malware that writes payloads to disk, fileless threats operate in memory, making them harder to detect, analyze, and eradicate.‚Äù
