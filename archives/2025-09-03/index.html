<h2 id="lazarus-group-expands-malware-arsenal-with-pondrat-themeforestrat-and-remotepe"><a id="article-1"></a>Lazarus Group Expands Malware Arsenal With PondRAT, ThemeForestRAT, and RemotePE</h2>

<p>The North Korea-linked threat actor known as the Lazarus Group has been attributed to a social engineering campaign that distributes three different pieces of cross-platform malware called PondRAT, ThemeForestRAT, and RemotePE. The attack, observed by NCC Group‚Äôs Fox-IT in 2024, targeted an organization in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, ultimately leading to the compromise of an employee‚Äôs system. ‚ÄúFrom there, the actor performed discovery from inside the network using different RATs in combination with other tools, for example, to harvest credentials or proxy connections,‚Äù Yun Zheng Hu and Mick Koomen
said
. ‚ÄúAfterwards, the actor moved to a stealthier RAT, likely signifying a next stage in the attack.‚Äù
The attack chain begins with the threat actor impersonating an existing employee of a trading company on Telegram and using fake websites masquerading as Calendly and Picktime to schedule a meeting with the victim.</p>

<p>Although the exact initial access vector is currently not known, the foothold is leveraged to deploy a loader called PerfhLoader, which then drops
PondRAT
, a known malware assessed to be a stripped-down variant of POOLRAT (aka SIMPLESEA). The cybersecurity company said there is some evidence to suggest that a
then-zero-day exploit in the Chrome browser
was used in the attack. Also delivered along with PondRAT are a number of other tools, including a screenshotter, keylogger, Chrome credential and cookie stealer, Mimikatz, FRPC, and proxy programs like MidProxy and Proxy Mini. ‚ÄúPondRAT is a straightforward RAT that allows an operator to read and write files, start processes, and run shellcode,‚Äù Fox-IT said, adding it
dates back
to
at least
2021
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe actor used PondRAT in combination with ThemeForestRAT for roughly three months, to afterwards clean up and install the more sophisticated RAT called RemotePE.‚Äù
The PondRAT malware is designed to communicate over HTTP(S) with a hard-coded command-and-control (C2) server to receive further instructions, with ThemeForestRAT launched directly in memory either via PondRAT or a dedicated loader. ThemeForestRAT, like PondRAT, monitors for new Remote Desktop (RDP) sessions and contacts a C2 server over HTTP(S) to retrieve as many as twenty commands to enumerate files/directories, perform file operations, execute commands, test TCP connection, timestomp file based on another file on disk, get process listing, download a files, inject shellcode, spawn processes, and hibernate for a specific amount of time. Fox-IT said ThemeForestRAT shares similarities with a malware codenamed RomeoGolf that was put to use by the Lazarus Group in the November 2014 destructive wiper attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE). It was documented by Novetta as part of a collaborative effort known as
Operation Blockbuster
.</p>

<p>RemotePE, on the other hand, is retrieved from a C2 server by RemotePELoader, which, in turn, is loaded by DPAPILoader. Written in C++, RemotePE is a more advanced RAT that‚Äôs likely reserved for high-value targets. ‚ÄúPondRAT is a primitive RAT that provides little flexibility, however, as an initial payload it achieves its purpose,‚Äù Fox-IT said. ‚ÄúFor more complex tasks, the actor uses ThemeForestRAT, which has more functionality and stays under the radar as it is loaded into memory only.‚Äù

<h2 id="researchers-warn-of-mystrodx-backdoor-using-dns-and-icmp-triggers-for-stealthy-control"><a id="article-2"></a>Researchers Warn of MystRodX Backdoor Using DNS and ICMP Triggers for Stealthy Control</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a stealthy new backdoor called
MystRodX
that comes with a variety of features to capture sensitive data from compromised systems. ‚ÄúMystRodX is a typical backdoor implemented in C++, supporting features like file management, port forwarding, reverse shell, and socket management,‚Äù QiAnXin XLab
said
in a report published last week. ‚ÄúCompared to typical backdoors, MystRodX stands out in terms of stealth and flexibility.‚Äù
MystRodX, also called ChronosRAT, was
first documented
by Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 last month in connection with a threat activity cluster called CL-STA-0969 that it said exhibits overlaps with a China-nexus cyber espionage group dubbed Liminal Panda. The malware‚Äôs stealth stems from the use of various levels of encryption to obscure source code and payloads, while its flexibility allows it to dynamically enable different functions based on a configuration, such as choosing TCP or HTTP for network communication, or opting for plaintext or AES encryption to secure network traffic.</p>

<p>MystRodX also supports what‚Äôs called a wake-up mode, thereby enabling it to function as a passive backdoor that can be triggered following the receipt of specially crafted DNS or ICMP network packets from incoming traffic. There is evidence to suggest that the malware may have been around since at least January 2024, based on an activation timestamp set in the configuration. ‚ÄúMagic value is verified, MystRodX establishes communication with the C2 [command-and-control] using the specified protocol and awaits further commands,‚Äù XLab researchers said. ‚ÄúUnlike well-known stealth backdoors like
SYNful Knock
, which manipulates TCP header fields to hide commands, MystRodX uses a simpler yet effective approach: it hides activation instructions directly in the payload of ICMP packets or within DNS query domains.‚Äù
The malware is delivered by means of a dropper that makes use of a spate of debugger- and virtual machine-related checks to determine if the current process is being debugged or it‚Äôs being run within a virtualized environment.</p>

<p>Once the validation step is complete, the next-stage payload is decrypted. It contains three components -
daytime, a launcher responsible for launching chargen
chargen, the MystRodX backdoor component, and
busybox
MystRodX, once executed, continuously monitors the daytime process, and if it is not found to be running, immediately launches it. Its configuration, which is encrypted using the AES algorithm, contains information pertaining to the C2 server, backdoor type, and main and backup C2 ports. ‚ÄúWhen the Backdoor Type is set to 1, MystRodX enters passive backdoor mode and waits for an activation message,‚Äù XLab said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhen the value of Backdoor Type is not 1, MystRodX enters active backdoor mode and establishes communication with the C2 specified in the configuration, waiting to execute the received commands.‚Äù

<h2 id="shadow-ai-discovery-a-critical-part-of-enterprise-ai-governance"><a id="article-3"></a>Shadow AI Discovery: A Critical Part of Enterprise AI Governance</h2>

<p>The Harsh Truths of AI Adoption
MITs
State of AI in Business
report revealed that while 40% of organizations have purchased enterprise LLM subscriptions, over 90% of employees are actively using AI tools in their daily work. Similarly, research from Harmonic Security found that
45.4% of sensitive AI interactions are coming from personal email accounts,
where employees are bypassing corporate controls entirely. This has, understandably, led to plenty of concerns around a growing ‚ÄúShadow AI Economy‚Äù. But what does that mean and how can security and AI governance teams overcome these challenges?</p>

<p>Contact Harmonic Security to learn more about Shadow AI discovery and enforcing your AI usage policy. AI Usage Is Driven by Employees, Not Committees
Enterprises incorrectly view AI use as something that comes top-down, defined by their own visionary business leaders. We now know that‚Äôs wrong. In most cases, employees are driving adoption from the bottom up, often without oversight, while governance frameworks are still being defined from the top down.</p>

<p>Even if they have enterprise-sanctioned tools, they are often eschewing these in favor of other newer tools that are better-placed to improve their productivity. Unless security leaders understand this reality, uncover and govern this activity, they are exposing the business to significant risks. Why Blocking Fails
Many organizations have tried to meet this challenge with a ‚Äúblock and wait‚Äù strategy. This approach seeks to restrict access to well-known AI platforms and hope adoption slows.</p>

<p>The reality is different. AI is no longer a category that can be easily fenced off. From productivity apps like Canva and Grammarly to collaboration tools with embedded assistants, AI is woven into nearly every SaaS app. Blocking one tool only drives employees to another, often through personal accounts or home devices, leaving the enterprise blind to real usage.</p>

<p>This is not the case for all enterprises, of course. Forward-leaning security and AI governance teams are looking to proactively understand what employees are using and for what use cases. They seek to understand what is happening and how to help their employees use the tools as securely as possible. Shadow AI Discovery as a Governance Imperative
An AI asset inventory is a regulatory requirement and not a nice-to-have.</p>

<p>Frameworks like the EU AI Act explicitly mandate organizations to maintain visibility into the AI systems in use, because without discovery there is no inventory, and without an inventory there can be no governance. Shadow AI is a key component of this. Different AI tools pose different risks. Some may quietly train on proprietary data, others may store sensitive information in jurisdictions like China, creating intellectual property exposure.</p>

<p>To comply with regulations and protect the business, security leaders must first uncover the full scope of AI usage, spanning sanctioned enterprise accounts and unsanctioned personal ones. Once armed with this visibility, organizations can separate low-risk use cases from those involving sensitive data, regulated workflows, or geographic exposure. Only then can they enforce meaningful governance policies that both protect data and enable employee productivity. How Harmonic Security Helps
Harmonic Security enables this approach by delivering intelligence controls for employee use of AI.</p>

<p>This includes continuous monitoring of Shadow AI, with off-the-shelf risk assessments for each application. Instead of relying on static block lists, Harmonic provides visibility into both sanctioned and unsanctioned AI use, then applies smart policies based on the sensitivity of the data, the role of the employee, and the nature of the tool. That means a marketing team might be permitted to put specific information into specific tools for content creation, while HR or legal teams are restricted from using personal accounts for sensitive employee information. This is underpinned by models that can identify and classify information as employees share the data.</p>

<p>This enables teams to enforce AI policies with the necessary precision. The Path Forward
Shadow AI is here to stay. As more SaaS applications embed AI, unmanaged use will only expand. Organizations that fail to address discovery today will find themselves unable to govern tomorrow.</p>

<p>The path forward is to govern it intelligently, rather than block it. Shadow AI discovery gives CISOs the visibility they need to protect sensitive data, meet regulatory requirements, and empower employees to safely take advantage of AI‚Äôs productivity benefits. Harmonic Security is already helping enterprises take this next step in AI governance. For CISOs, it‚Äôs no longer a question of whether employees are using Shadow AI‚Ä¶it‚Äôs whether you can see it.</p>

<h2 id="ukrainian-network-fdn3-launches-massive-brute-force-attacks-on-ssl-vpn-and-rdp-devices"><a id="article-4"></a>Ukrainian Network FDN3 Launches Massive Brute-Force Attacks on SSL VPN and RDP Devices</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have flagged a Ukrainian IP network for engaging in massive brute-force and password spraying campaigns targeting SSL VPN and RDP devices between June and July 2025. The activity originated from a Ukraine-based autonomous system FDN3 (
AS211736
), per French cybersecurity company Intrinsec. ‚ÄúWe believe with a high level of confidence that FDN3 is part of a wider abusive infrastructure composed of two other Ukrainian networks, VAIZ-AS (
AS61432
) and ERISHENNYA-ASN (
AS210950
), and a Seychelles-based autonomous system named TK-NET (
AS210848
),‚Äù according to a report
published
last week. ‚ÄúThose were all allocated in August 2021 and often exchange IPv4 prefixes with one another to evade blocklisting and continue hosting abusive activities.‚Äù
AS61432 currently announces a single prefix 185.156.72[.]0/24, while AS210950 has announced two prefixes 45.143.201[.]0/24 and
185.193.89[.]0/24.</p>

<p>The two autonomous systems were allocated in May and August 2021, respectively. A major chunk of their prefixes has been announced on AS210848, another autonomous system also allocated in August 2021. ‚ÄúThis network shares all its peering agreements with IP Volume Inc. ‚Äì
AS202425
, a company based in Seychelles and created by Ecatel‚Äôs owners, infamous for running an extensively abusive bulletproof hosting service in the Netherlands since 2005,‚Äù Intrinsec noted.</p>

<p>The entirety of prefixes that were moved from AS61432 and AS210950 are now announced by bulletproof and abusive networks fronted by shell companies like
Global Internet Solutions LLC
(gir.network),
Global Connectivity Solutions LLP
, Verasel, IP Volume Inc., and Telkom Internet LTD. The findings build upon prior disclosures about how multiple networks allocated in August 2021 and based in Ukraine and Seychelles ‚Äì AS61432, AS210848, and AS210950 ‚Äì were used for spam distribution, network attacks, and malware command-and-control hosting. In June 2025, some of the IPv4 prefixes announced by these networks were moved to FDN3, which was created in August 2021. That‚Äôs not all.</p>

<p>Three of the prefixes announced by AS210848, and one by AS61432, were previously announced by another Russian network, SibirInvest OOO (
AS44446
). Of the four IPv4 prefixes announced by FDN3, one of them (88.210.63[.]0/24) is assessed to have been previously announced by a U.S.-based bulletproof hosting solution named Virtualine (
AS214940
and
AS214943
). It‚Äôs this IPv4 prefix range that has been attributed to large-scale brute-force and password spraying attempts, with the activity scaling to a record high between July 6 and 8, 2025. The brute-force and password spraying efforts aimed at SSL VPN and RDP assets could last up to three days, per Intrinsec.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs worth noting that these techniques have been adopted by various ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) groups like
Black Basta
,
GLOBAL GROUP
, and
RansomHub
as an initial access vector to breach corporate networks. The two other prefixes that FDN3 announced in June, 92.63.197[.]0/24 and 185.156.73[.]0/24, were previously announced by AS210848, indicating a high degree of operational overlap. 92.63.197[.]0/24, for its part, has ties to Bulgarian spam networks like ROZA-AS (
AS212283
). ‚ÄúAll those strong similarities, including their configuration, the content they host, and their creation date, led us to assess with a high level of confidence the previously mentioned autonomous systems to be operated by a common bulletproof hosting administrator,‚Äù Intrinsec explained.</p>

<p>Further analysis of FDN3 has uncovered ties to a Russian company called Alex Host LLC that, in the past, has been linked to bulletproof hosting providers like TNSECURITY, which have been used to host
Doppelganger infrastructure
. ‚ÄúThis investigation once again highlights a common phenomenon of offshore ISPs such as IP Volume Inc. enabling smaller bulletproof networks through peering agreements and prefix hosting overall,‚Äù the company said. ‚ÄúThanks to their offshore location, such as Seychelles, which provides anonymity to the owners of those companies, the malicious activities perpetrated through those networks cannot be directly imputed to them.‚Äù
The development comes as Censys uncovered a connect-back proxy management system associated with the
PolarEdge
botnet that‚Äôs currently running on over 2,400 hosts.</p>

<p>The system is an
RPX server
that operates as a reverse-connect proxy gateway capable of managing proxy nodes and exposing proxy services. ‚ÄúThis system appears to be a well-designed server that may be one of the many tools used for managing the PolarEdge botnet,‚Äù senior security researcher Mark Ellzey
said
. ‚ÄúIt is also possible that this specific service is completely unrelated to PolarEdge and is instead a service that the botnet utilizes to jump between different relays.‚Äù

<h2 id="silver-fox-exploits-microsoft-signed-watchdog-driver-to-deploy-valleyrat-malware"><a id="article-5"></a>Silver Fox Exploits Microsoft-Signed WatchDog Driver to Deploy ValleyRAT Malware</h2>

<p>The threat actor known as
Silver Fox
has been attributed to abuse of a previously unknown vulnerable driver associated with WatchDog Anti-malware as part of a Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (
BYOVD
) attack aimed at disarming security solutions installed on compromised hosts. The vulnerable driver in question is ‚Äúamsdk.sys‚Äù (version 1.0.600), a 64-bit, validly signed Windows kernel device driver that‚Äôs assessed to be built upon Zemana Anti-Malware SDK. ‚ÄúThis driver, built on the Zemana Anti-Malware SDK, was Microsoft-signed, not listed in the
Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist
, and not detected by community projects like LOLDrivers,‚Äù Check Point
said
in an analysis. The attack is characterized by a dual-driver strategy, where a
known vulnerable Zemana driver
(‚Äúzam.exe‚Äù) is used for Windows 7 machines, and the
undetected WatchDog driver
for systems that run on Windows 10 or 11.</p>

<p>The WatchDog Anti-malware driver has been found to contain multiple vulnerabilities, the first and foremost being the ability to terminate arbitrary processes without verifying whether the process is running as protected (PP/PPL). It‚Äôs also susceptible to local privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to gain unrestricted access to the
driver‚Äôs device
. The end goal of the campaign, first spotted by Check Point in late May 2025, is to leverage these vulnerable drivers to neutralize endpoint protection products, creating a clear path for malware deployment and persistence without triggering signature-based defenses. As observed before, the campaign is designed to deliver
ValleyRAT
(aka Winos 4.0) as the final payload, providing remote access and control capabilities to the threat actor.</p>

<p>The cybersecurity company said the attacks employ an all-in-one loader, encapsulating anti-analysis features, two embedded drivers, antivirus killer logic, and the ValleyRAT DLL downloader in one binary. ‚ÄúUpon execution, the sample performs a few common anti-analysis checks, such as Anti-VM (detection of virtual environments), Anti-Sandbox (detection of execution within a sandbox), hypervisor detection, and others,‚Äù Check Point said. ‚ÄúIf any of these checks fail, the execution is aborted, and a fake system error message is displayed.‚Äù
The downloader is designed to communicate with a command-and-control (C2) server to fetch the modular ValleyRAT backdoor onto the infected machine. Following responsible disclosure, Watchdog has released a patch (version 1.1.100) to address the LPE risk by enforcing a strong Discretionary Access Control List (DACL), while not plugging the arbitrary process termination issue.</p>

<p>This, in turn, has had the side effect of causing the attackers to swiftly adapt and incorporate the modified version by altering just a single byte without invalidating Microsoft‚Äôs signature. ‚ÄúBy flipping a single byte in the unauthenticated timestamp field, they preserved the driver‚Äôs valid Microsoft signature while generating a new file hash, effectively bypassing hash-based blocklists,‚Äù Check Point noted. ‚ÄúThis subtle yet efficient evasion technique mirrors patterns seen in earlier campaigns.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis campaign demonstrates how threat actors are moving beyond known weaknesses to weaponize unknown, signed drivers‚Äîa blind spot for many defense mechanisms. The exploitation of a Microsoft-signed, previously unclassified vulnerable driver, combined with evasive techniques such as signature manipulation, represents a sophisticated and evolving threat.‚Äù
Silver Fox, also called SwimSnake, The Great Thief of Valley (or Valley Thief), UTG-Q-1000, and Void Arachne, is
assessed
to be highly active since early last year, primarily targeting Chinese-speaking victims using fake websites masquerading as Google Chrome, Telegram, and artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools like DeepSeek to distribute remote access trojans like ValleyRAT.</p>

<p>According to Chinese cybersecurity vendor Antiy, the hacking group is believed to have been around since the second half of 2022, targeting domestic users and companies with an attempt to steal secrets and defraud them. ‚ÄúThe cybercriminal group mainly spreads malicious files through instant messaging software (WeChat, Enterprise WeChat, etc. ), search engine SEO promotion, phishing emails, etc.,‚Äù the company
said
. ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòSwimSnake‚Äô cybercriminal group is still frequently updating malware and AV evasion methods.‚Äù
The attacks employ trojanized versions of open-source software, malicious programs built using the Qt framework, or MSI installers disguised as Youdao, Sogou AI, WPS Office, and DeepSeek to serve Valley RAT, including its
online module
that can capture screenshots of WeChat and online banks.</p>

<p>The development comes as QiAnXin also detailed a separate campaign mounted by the ‚ÄúFinance Group‚Äù within Silver Fox that targets financial personnel and managers of enterprises and institutions, aiming to plunder sensitive financial information or directly profit through fraud. These attacks leverage phishing lures related to tax audits, electronic invoices, subsidy announcements, and personnel transfers to deceive users into running remote access trojans, while relying on legitimate cloud services such as Alibaba Cloud OSS and Youdao Cloud Notes to host malicious payloads in an attempt to sidestep detection. The Finance Group is one of the four sub-clusters part of Silver Fox, the other three being the News and Romance Group, the Design and Manufacturing Group, and the Black Watering Hole Group. Interestingly, after the Finance Group gains control of a victim‚Äôs computer through methods like watering hole attacks and phishing, they take over the victim‚Äôs social media accounts and leverage them to send phishing QR codes to various WeChat group chats with the goal of harvesting bank account numbers and passwords from group members, ultimately draining funds from their bank accounts for profit.</p>

<p>‚ÄúUTG-Q-1000 is one of the most active and aggressive cybercrime groups in China in recent years. Their operations are highly organized, technically sophisticated, and financially motivated,‚Äù QiAnXin
said
. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve established a complete black-market profit chain involving: espionage (data theft), remote control via malware, and financial fraud and phishing.‚Äù

<h2 id="malicious-npm-package-nodejs-smtp-mimics-nodemailer-targets-atomic-and-exodus-wallets"><a id="article-6"></a>Malicious npm Package nodejs-smtp Mimics Nodemailer, Targets Atomic and Exodus Wallets</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a malicious npm package that comes with stealthy features to inject malicious code into desktop apps for cryptocurrency wallets like Atomic and Exodus on Windows systems. The package, named
nodejs-smtp
, impersonates the legitimate email library
nodemailer
with an identical tagline, page styling, and README descriptions, attracting a total of
347 downloads
since it was
uploaded
to the npm registry in April 2025 by a user named ‚Äúnikotimon.‚Äù It‚Äôs currently no longer available. ‚ÄúOn import, the package uses Electron tooling to unpack Atomic Wallet‚Äôs app.asar, replace a vendor bundle with a malicious payload, repackage the application, and remove traces by deleting its working directory,‚Äù Socket researcher Kirill Boychenko
said
. The main objective is to overwrite the recipient address with hard-coded wallets controlled by the threat actor, redirecting Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT and TRX USDT), XRP (XRP), and Solana (SOL) transactions, effectively acting as a cryptocurrency clipper.</p>

<p>That having said, the package delivers on its stated functionality by acting as an SMTP-based mailer in an attempt to avoid raising developers‚Äô suspicion. The package still works as a mailer and exposes a drop-in interface compatible with nodemailer. That functional cover lowers suspicion, allows application tests to pass, and gives developers little reason to question the dependency. The development comes months after ReversingLabs
discovered
an npm package named ‚Äúpdf-to-office‚Äù that achieved the same goals by unpacking the ‚Äúapp.asar‚Äù archives associated with Atomic and Exodus wallets and modifying within them a JavaScript file to introduce the clipper function.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis campaign shows how a routine import on a developer workstation can quietly modify a separate desktop application and persist across reboots,‚Äù Boychenko said. ‚ÄúBy abusing import time execution and Electron packaging, a lookalike mailer becomes a wallet drainer that alters Atomic and Exodus on compromised Windows systems.‚Äù

<h2 id="android-droppers-now-deliver-sms-stealers-and-spyware-not-just-banking-trojans"><a id="article-7"></a>Android Droppers Now Deliver SMS Stealers and Spyware, Not Just Banking Trojans</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers are calling attention to a new shift in the Android malware landscape where dropper apps, which are typically used to deliver banking trojans, to also distribute simpler malware such as SMS stealers and basic spyware. These campaigns are propagated via dropper apps masquerading as government or banking apps in India and other parts of Asia, ThreatFabric
said
in a report last week. The Dutch mobile security firm said the change is driven by
recent security protections
that Google has piloted in select markets like Singapore, Thailand, Brazil, and India to block sideloading of potentially suspicious apps requesting dangerous permissions like SMS messages and
accessibility services
, a heavily abused setting to carry out malicious actions on Android devices. ‚ÄúGoogle Play Protect‚Äôs defences, particularly the targeted Pilot Program, are increasingly effective at stopping risky apps before they run,‚Äù the company said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSecond, actors want to future-proof their operations.‚Äù
‚ÄúBy encapsulating even basic payloads inside a dropper, they gain a protective shell that can evade today‚Äôs checks while staying flexible enough to swap payloads and pivot campaigns tomorrow.‚Äù
ThreatFabric said that while Google‚Äôs strategy ups the ante by blocking a malicious app from being installed even before a user can interact with it, attackers are trying out new ways to get around the safeguards ‚Äì an indication of the endless game of whack-a-mole when it comes to security. This includes designing droppers keeping in mind Google‚Äôs Pilot Program, so that they don‚Äôt seek high-risk permissions and serve only a harmless ‚Äúupdate‚Äù screen that can fly past scanning in the regions. But it‚Äôs only when the user clicks the ‚ÄúUpdate‚Äù button that the actual payload gets fetched from an external server or unpacked, which then proceeds to seek the necessary permissions to fulfil its objectives. ‚ÄúPlay Protect may display alerts about the risks, as a part of a different scan, but as long as the user accepts them, the app is installed, and the payload is delivered,‚Äù ThreatFabric said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis illustrates a critical gap: Play Protect still allows risky apps through if the user clicks Install anyway, and the malware still slips through the Pilot Program.‚Äù
One such dropper is RewardDropMiner, which has been found to serve along with spyware payloads a Monero cryptocurrency miner that can be activated remotely. Recent variants of the tool, however, no longer include the miner functionality. Some of the malicious apps delivered via RewardDropMiner, all targeting users in India, are listed below -
PM YOJANA 2025 (com.fluvdp.hrzmkgi)
¬∞RTO Challan (com.epr.fnroyex)
SBI Online (com.qmwownic.eqmff)
Axis Card (com.tolqppj.yqmrlytfzrxa)
Other dropper variants that avoid triggering Play Protect or the Pilot Program include SecuriDropper, Zombinder, BrokewellDropper, HiddenCatDropper, and TiramisuDropper. When reached for comment, Google told The Hacker News it has not found any apps using these techniques distributed via the Play Store and that it‚Äôs constantly adding new protections.</p>

<p>‚ÄúRegardless of where an app comes from ‚Äì even if it‚Äôs installed by a ‚Äòdropper‚Äô app ‚Äì Google Play Protect helps to keep users safe by automatically checking it for threats,‚Äù a spokesperson said. ‚ÄúProtection against these identified malware versions was already in place through Google Play Protect prior to this report. Based on our current detection, no apps containing these versions of this malware have been found on Google Play. We‚Äôre constantly enhancing our protections to help keep users safe from bad actors.‚Äù
The development comes as Bitdefender Labs has warned of a new campaign that‚Äôs using malicious ads on Facebook to peddle a free premium version of the TradingView app for Android to ultimately deploy an improved version of the
Brokewell
banking trojan to monitor, control, and steal sensitive information from the victim‚Äôs device.</p>

<p>No less than 75 malicious ads have been run since July 22, 2025, reaching tens of thousands of users in the European Union alone. The Android attack wave is just one part of a larger malvertising operation that has abused Facebook Ads to also target Windows desktops under the guise of various financial and cryptocurrency apps. ‚ÄúThis campaign shows how cybercriminals are fine-tuning their tactics to keep up with user behavior,‚Äù the Romanian cybersecurity company
said
. ‚ÄúBy targeting mobile users and disguising malware as trusted trading tools, attackers hope to cash in on the growing reliance on crypto apps and financial platforms.‚Äù

<p>Cybersecurity today is less about single attacks and more about chains of small weaknesses that connect into big risks. One overlooked update, one misused account, or one hidden tool in the wrong hands can be enough to open the door. The news this week shows how attackers are mixing methods‚Äîcombining stolen access, unpatched software, and clever tricks to move from small entry points to large consequences. For defenders, the lesson is clear: the real danger often comes not from one major flaw, but from how different small flaws interact together.</p>

<p>‚ö° Threat of the Week
WhatsApp Patches Actively Exploited Flaw
‚Äî WhatsApp addressed a security vulnerability in its messaging apps for Apple iOS and macOS that it said may have been exploited in the wild in conjunction with a recently disclosed Apple flaw in targeted zero-day attacks. The vulnerability, CVE-2025-55177 relates to a case of insufficient authorization of linked device synchronization messages. The Meta-owned company said the issue ‚Äúcould have allowed an unrelated user to trigger processing of content from an arbitrary URL on a target‚Äôs device.‚Äù It also assessed that the shortcoming may have been chained with CVE-2025-43300, a vulnerability affecting iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, as part of a sophisticated attack against specific targeted users. WhatsApp said it sent in-app threat notifications to less than 200 users who may have been targeted as part of the spyware campaign.</p>

U.S. Treasury Continues to Hit IT Worker Scheme with Sanctions
‚Äî The U.S. Department of the Treasury‚Äôs Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned a fraudulent IT worker network linked to the Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea (DPRK).</p>

<p>This
included
Vitaliy Sergeyevich Andreyev, a Russian national who facilitated payments to Chinyong Information Technology Cooperation Company (Chinyong), also known as Jinyong IT Cooperation Company, which was sanctioned by OFAC and South Korea‚Äôs Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) in May 2023. Also included in the designation were Kim‚ÄØUng‚ÄØSun, Shenyang Geumpungri Network Technology Co., Ltd., and Korea‚ÄØSinjin Trading Corporation. These actors were
designated
for their involvement in schemes that funnel DPRK IT worker-derived revenue to support DPRK weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs. The cryptocurrency wallet linked to Andreyev has ‚Äúreceived over $600,000 of payments and has source exposure back to the Atomic Wallet exploit of June 2023,‚Äù which was attributed to the Lazarus Group, per
Elliptic
.</p>

<p>The designation builds upon other actions OFAC has taken to disrupt the DPRK‚Äôs IT worker schemes. Critical Docker Flaw Patched
‚Äî Users of Docker Desktop on Windows and Mac are urged to upgrade to the latest version to patch a critical vulnerability that could allow an attacker to break the container isolation layer and potentially take over the host system. The vulnerability (CVE-2025-9074) stems from the fact that Docker Desktop exposes the Docker Engine API, which can be used to control Docker containers over a TCP socket without any authentication. As a result of this flaw, an attacker who gains access to a Docker container could leverage the API to create a new Docker container and mount the operating system‚Äôs file system, gaining access to sensitive information or overwriting system-critical files, resulting in arbitrary code execution.</p>

<p>However, mounting the file system administrator works only on Windows, as attempting this process on macOS would prompt the user for permission. Also, on macOS, Docker doesn‚Äôt run with administrator privileges like it does on Windows. Critical Sectors Targeted by MixShell
‚Äî Cybercriminals have targeted dozens of critical U.S. manufacturers and supply-chain companies, looking to steal sensitive data and deploy ransomware.</p>

<p>The activity, dubbed ZipLine, dates back to the beginning of May 2025. Instead of emailing a malicious link in an unsolicited email, the miscreants initiate contact through the organization‚Äôs public ‚ÄúContact Us‚Äù form under the guise of partnership inquiries or other business pretexts, tricking the victim into starting the conversation and allowing the attackers to bypass email filters. The attacks led to the deployment of a stealthy implant called MixShell. By using website contact forms, the attack flips the phishing playbook by getting victims to make the first email contact with the attacker rather than the other way around.</p>

<p>Salesforce Instances Targeted via Salesloft Drift
‚Äî A threat activity cluster has committed a spate of data breaches of organizations‚Äô Salesforce instances by compromising OAuth tokens associated with the Salesloft Drift third-party application. UNC6395 has been carrying out a ‚Äúwidespread data theft‚Äù campaign by targeting Salesforce instances beginning as early as August 8 through at least August 18. UNC6395 ‚Äúsystematically exported large volumes of data from numerous corporate Salesforce instances‚Äù for the purpose of harvesting sensitive credentials, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) access keys (AKIA), passwords, and Snowflake-related access tokens. Once these credentials were exfiltrated, ‚Äúthe actor then searched through the data to look for secrets that could be potentially used to compromise victim environments,‚Äù and then covered its tracks by deleting query jobs.</p>

<p>Storm-0501 Linked to Cloud Extortion Attacks
‚Äî Storm-0501 has sharpened its ransomware tactics by exploiting hijacked privileged accounts to move seamlessly between on-premises and cloud environments, exploiting visibility gaps to encrypt data and exfiltrate sensitive data, and carry out mass deletions of cloud resources, including backups. The threat actor checked for the presence of security software, suggesting a deliberate effort to avoid detection by targeting non-onboarded systems. The attackers also conducted reconnaissance activities to gain deep visibility into the organization‚Äôs security tooling and infrastructure. This evolution signals a technical shift and a change in impact strategy.</p>

<p>Instead of just encrypting files and demanding ransom for decryption, Storm-0501 exfiltrates sensitive cloud data, destroys backups, and then extorts victims by threatening permanent data loss or exposure. UNC6384 Deploys PlugX via Captive Portal Hijack
‚Äî Chinese state hackers have been hijacking captive portal checks to deliver malware couched as Adobe software. The activity, attributed to Mustang Panda, appears to have targeted Southeast Asian diplomats in particular, and other unidentified entities around the globe, between approximately March and July of this year. Around two dozen victims were likely compromised, although it‚Äôs possible there were more.</p>

<p>The trick to Mustang Panda‚Äôs latest campaign involves hijacking captive portal checks to redirect users to a website under their control to distribute malware. It‚Äôs believed that the hackers infected edge devices in the targets‚Äô networks, which they used to intercept the check made by the Google Chrome browser. Users who fell for the scheme ended up downloading an ostensibly innocuous binary that ultimately led to the deployment of PlugX. ShadowCapatcha Leverages ClickFix to Deliver Malware
‚Äî A financially motivated campaign dubbed ShadowCaptcha is leveraging fake Google and Cloudflare CAPTCHA pages to trick victims into executing malicious commands using compromised WordPress sites as an infection vector.</p>

<p>The attacks lead to the deployment of information stealers and ransomware, demonstrating a versatile monetization approach. The activity primarily focuses on three revenue streams: Data theft and subsequent sale, drop cryptocurrency miners, and infect machines with ransomware. This multi-pronged strategy ensures a sustained revenue generation mechanism, maximising their return on investment while also maintaining persistent access. üî• Trending CVEs
Hackers act fast.</p>

<p>They attack soon after a weakness is found. One missed update, a hidden error, or a forgotten security alert can let them in. A small problem can quickly turn into big trouble like stolen data or system crashes, before you even notice. Here are this week‚Äôs serious risks.</p>

<p>Check them, fix them fast, and stay safe before attackers do. This week‚Äôs list includes ‚Äî

Microsoft RDP services Targeted by Malicious Scans
‚Äî Microsoft‚Äôs Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) services have been hit with a torrent of malicious scans from tens of thousands of IP addresses in recent days, indicating a coordinated reconnaissance campaign. ‚ÄúThe wave‚Äôs aim was clear: test for timing flaws that reveal valid usernames, laying the groundwork for credential-based intrusions,‚Äù GreyNoise
said
.</p>

<p>The activity took place over two waves on August 21 and 24, with thousands of unique IP addresses simultaneously probing both Microsoft RD Web Access and Microsoft RDP Web Client authentication portals. Flaw in TheTruthSpy Spyware
‚Äî A vulnerability in TheTruthSpy spyware app can allow bad actors to take over any account and retrieve collected victim data. The vulnerability exploits an issue with the app‚Äôs password recovery process to change the password of any account. TheTruthSpy
told
TechCrunch it can‚Äôt fix the bug because it ‚Äúlost‚Äù the app‚Äôs source code.</p>

<p>Russia‚Äôs Max App Logs User Activity
‚Äî The Russian government‚Äôs WhatsApp rival, Max, is constantly monitoring and logging all user activity. According to Corellium‚Äôs
technical analysis
, the app doesn‚Äôt use encryption and tracks user location in real-time and with high accuracy. Developed by Russian tech giant VK, the app has been made mandatory and must be installed on all mobile devices sold in Russia after September 1, 2025. The app was initially launched earlier this March.</p>

<p>OpenSSH‚Äôs PQC Play
‚Äî OpenSSH
said
it will start showing warnings when users connect to an SSH server that does not have post-quantum cryptography protections starting with OpenSSH 10.1. ‚ÄúThe ideal solution is to update the server to use an SSH implementation that supports at least one of these,‚Äù the maintainers said. ‚ÄúOpenSSH versions 9.0 and greater support sntrup761x25519-sha512 and versions 9.9 and greater support mlkem768x25519-sha256. If your server is already running one of these versions, then check whether the KexAlgorithms option has disabled their use.‚Äù
Credential Harvesting Campaign Targets ScreenConnect Super Admin Accounts
‚Äî A low-volume campaign is targeting ScreenConnect cloud administrators with fake email alerts warning about a potentially suspicious login event with the goal of stealing their credentials for potential ransomware deployment.</p>

<p>The activity, ongoing since 2022, has been attributed by Mimecast to MCTO3030. ‚ÄúThe campaign employs spear phishing emails delivered through Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) accounts, targeting senior IT professionals, including directors, managers, and security personnel with elevated privileges in ScreenConnect environments,‚Äù the company
said
. ‚ÄúThe attackers specifically seek super administrator credentials, which provide comprehensive control over remote access infrastructure across entire organizations.‚Äù The attackers are using the open source
Evilginx
framework to provision these phishing pages and to act as a reverse proxy between the victim and the real site. The framework can capture both login credentials and session cookies.</p>

<p>More ScreenConnect-Themed Campaigns Discovered
‚Äî Another campaign has leveraged phishing emails with fake Zoom meeting invitations and Microsoft Teams calls to lead victims to malicious links that download the ScreenConnect software. ‚ÄúThe weaponization of a legitimate IT administration tool ‚Äì one designed to grant IT professionals deep system access for troubleshooting and maintenance ‚Äì combined with social engineering and convincing business impersonation creates a multi-layered deception that provides attackers with the dual advantage of trust exploitation and security evasion,‚Äù Abnormal AI
said
. The campaign has so far targeted more than 900 organizations, impacting a broad range of sectors and geographies. A separate campaign has also been observed using fake AI-themed content to lure users into executing a malicious, pre-configured ScreenConnect installer, which then acts as an entry point for the
XWorm
malware, per
Trustwave
.</p>

<p>In a related development, attackers have been observed weaponizing Cisco‚Äôs secure links (‚Äúsecure-web.cisco[.]com‚Äù) in credential phishing campaigns to evade link scanning and by-pass network filters. ‚ÄúAttackers compromise or create accounts within Cisco-protected organizations,‚Äù Raven AI
said
. ‚ÄúThey simply email themselves malicious links, let Cisco‚Äôs system rewrite them into Safe Links, then harvest these URLs for their campaigns.‚Äù A similar campaign exploiting Proofpoint links was
disclosed
by Cloudflare in July 2025. TRM Labs Warns of Scam Campaign Impersonating the Firm
‚Äî Blockchain intelligence company said it‚Äôs aware of individuals using false domains to impersonate TRM Labs and/or government agencies working in collaboration with TRM Labs.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThese are not TRM Labs domains, and the actors behind these are scammers,‚Äù the company
said
. ‚ÄúTRM Labs is not involved in fund recovery processes for victims and does not partner with government agencies for the purposes of fund recovery. Unfortunately, these types of scams deliberately target vulnerable people, often when they‚Äôre financially vulnerable, having potentially already lost funds to scams.‚Äù The warning comes against the backdrop of an alert
issued
by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), urging cryptocurrency scam victims to be on the lookout for scams where fraudsters pose as lawyers representing fictitious law firms to help them assist with fund recovery, only to deceive them a second time.</p>

<p>New Ransomware Strains Detected
‚Äî A new ransomware strain going by the name of
Cephalus
has been spotted in the wild. In incidents observed around mid-August 2025, the group behind the locker used compromised RDP accounts for initial access and used the cloud storage service MEGA for likely data exfiltration purposes. The development comes as the
Underground
and
NightSpire
ransomware gangs have launched ransomware attacks against companies in various countries and industries, including South Korea. In another attack analyzed by eSentire, compromised third-party MSP SonicWall SSL VPN credentials served as an initial access pathway for Sinobi, a rebrand of the Lynx ransomware.</p>

<p>‚ÄúUsing the compromised account, the threat actors executed commands to create a new local administrator account, set its password, and add it to the domain administrators group,‚Äù eSentire
said
. ‚ÄúBoth the initial compromised account and the newly created account were subsequently used for lateral movement throughout the network.‚Äù
Most Active Ransomware Groups
‚Äî Akira, Cl0p, Qilin, Safepay, and RansomHub were the most active ransomware groups in the first half of 2025, per
Flashpoint
, which found that ransomware attacks increased by 179% compared to the 2024 midyear. The development comes amid notable changes in the ransomware ecosystem, where threat actors increasingly prefer extortion over encryption and have begun to incorporate LLMs in their tooling. The landscape has also continued to splinter, with new gangs and rebrands proliferating in the wake of law enforcement takedowns.</p>

<p>MalwareBytes
said
it tracked 41 newcomers between July 2024 and June 2025, with more than 60 total ransomware gangs operating at once. Microsoft to Throttle Emails to Combat Spam
‚Äî Microsoft said it will begin throttling emails starting October 15, 2025. The limit will be set to 100 external recipients per organization per 24-hour rolling window. From December 1, the tech giant will start rolling out the restrictions across tenants, starting with tenants with fewer than three seats and eventually reaching tenants with more than 10,001 seats by June 2026.</p>

<p>‚ÄúDespite our efforts to minimize abuse, spammers often exploit newly created tenants to send bursts of spam from ‚Äò.onmicrosoft.com‚Äô addresses before we can intervene,‚Äù Microsoft
said
. ‚ÄúThis degrades this shared domain‚Äôs reputation, affecting all legitimate users. To ensure brand trust and email deliverability, organizations should establish and use their own custom domains for sending email.‚Äù
SleepWalk, a Physical Side-Channel Attack to Leak Data
‚Äî A group of academics from the University of Florida has devised a new hardware side-channel attack dubbed SleepWalk that exploits context switching and CPU power consumption to leak sensitive data like cryptographic keys. ‚ÄúWe introduce a physical power side-channel leakage source that exploits the power spike observed during a context switch, triggered by the inbuilt sleep function of the system kernel,‚Äù the researchers
said
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe observed that this power spike directly correlates with both the power consumption during context switching and the residual power consumption of the previously executed program. Notably, the persistence of residual power signatures from previous workloads extends the scope of this side-channel beyond extracting the data in registers during the context switch. Unlike traditional approaches that require analyzing full power traces, applying complex preprocessing, or relying on external synchronization triggers, this novel technique leverages only the amplitude of a single power spike, significantly simplifying the attack.‚Äù
AI Systems Vulnerable to Prompt Injection via Image Scaling Attack
‚Äî In a novel form of prompt injection attacks aimed at artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots, attackers can hide malicious instructions inside large-scale images and have the prompts execute when the AI agent downscales them. The attacker‚Äôs prompt is invisible to the human eye in the high-resolution image, but shows up when the image is downscaled by preprocessing algorithms.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis attack works because AI systems often scale down large images before sending them to the model: when scaled, these images can reveal prompt injections that are not visible at full resolution,‚Äù Trail of Bits
said
. The cybersecurity company has released an open-source tool called
Anamorpher
to generate such crafted images. Social Media Accounts Launder News from Chinese State Media Sites
‚Äî A network of 11 domains and 16 companion social media accounts across Facebook, Instagram, Mastodon, Threads, and X has been found laundering exclusively English-language articles originally published by the Chinese state media outlet CGTN. ‚ÄúThe assets almost certainly used AI tools to translate and summarize articles from CGTN, likely in an attempt to disguise the content‚Äôs origin,‚Äù Graphika
said
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe network assets disseminated primarily pro-China, anti-West content in English, French, Spanish, and Vietnamese.‚Äù The findings came as the U.S. told
Denmark to ‚Äúcalm down‚Äù over allegations of covert influence operations by U.S. citizens in Greenland to sow discord between Denmark and Greenland and to promote Greenland‚Äôs secession from Denmark to the U.S. Analyzing Secret Families of VPN Apps
‚Äî New research
conducted
by the Arizona State University and Citizen Lab has found that nearly two dozen VPN applications in Google Play contain security weaknesses impacting the privacy of their users, exposing transmitted data to decryption risks.</p>

<p>Further analysis has determined that eight VPN applications from Innovative Connecting, Autumn Breeze, and Lemon Clove (Turbo VPN, Turbo VPN Lite, VPN Monster, VPN Proxy Master, VPN Proxy Master ‚Äì Lite, Snap VPN, Robot VPN, and SuperNet VPN) share code, dependencies, outdated and unsafe encryption methods, and hard-coded passwords, potentially allowing attackers to decrypt the traffic of their users. Cumulatively, these apps have over 380 million downloads on Google Play. All three companies were found to have ties with Qihoo 360, a Chinese cybersecurity firm that the U.S. sanctioned in 2020.</p>

<p>Security Risks in the eSIM Ecosystem
‚Äî A new study undertaken by academics from Northeastern University has found that many providers associated with eSIMs route user data through foreign telecommunications networks, including Chinese infrastructure, regardless of user location. ‚ÄúMany travel eSIMs route user traffic through third-party infrastructure, often located in foreign jurisdictions,‚Äù the researchers
said
. ‚ÄúThis may expose user metadata and content to networks outside the user‚Äôs country, raising concerns about jurisdictional control and surveillance.‚Äù What‚Äôs more, the digital provisioning model creates new opportunities for phishing and spoofing. Malicious actors can distribute fake eSIM profiles via fraudulent QR codes or websites, tricking users into installing unauthorized configurations.</p>

<p>ComfyUI Flaw Exploited to Deliver Pickai Backdoor
‚Äî Threat actors have exploited vulnerabilities in an artificial intelligence (AI) platform called ComfyUI to deliver a backdoor called Pickai. ‚ÄúPickai is a lightweight backdoor written in C++, designed to support remote command execution and reverse shell access,‚Äù XLab
said
, adding that it ‚Äúincludes anti-debugging, process name spoofing, and multiple persistence mechanisms.‚Äù Pickai samples have been observed hosted on the official site of Rubick.ai, a commercial AI-powered platform serving the e-commerce sector across the U.S., India, Singapore, and the Middle East. Early versions of the malware were uploaded to VirusTotal as far back as February 28, 2025. The activity has compromised nearly 700 infected servers worldwide, mainly in Germany, the U.S., and China.</p>

<p>Flaw in LSQUIC QUIC Disclosed
‚Äî Cybersecurity researchers have
discovered
a vulnerability dubbed QUIC-LEAK (CVE-2025-54939) in the LSQUIC QUIC implementation, allowing threat actors to smuggle malformed packets to exhaust memory and crash QUIC servers even before a connection handshake is established, thereby bypassing QUIC connection-level safeguards. The issue has been fixed in OpenLiteSpeed 1.8.4 and LiteSpeed Web Server 6.3.4. Fake Sites Pushing YouTube Downloads Serve Proxyware
‚Äî Proxyware programs are being
distributed
through YouTube sites that allow users to download videos. Attackers who previously installed DigitalPulse and HoneyGain Proxywares are also installing Infatica Proxyware.</p>

<p>Similar to coin miners, Proxyware malware profits by utilizing the system‚Äôs resources, and many systems in South Korea have recently become the targets of these attacks. U.S. Senator Castigates Federal Judiciary for Negligence
‚Äî U.S. Senator Ron Wyden accused the federal judiciary of ‚Äúnegligence and incompetence‚Äù following a
recent hack
, reportedly by hackers with ties to the Russian government, that exposed confidential court documents.</p>

<p>The breach of the judiciary‚Äôs electronic case filing system
first came to light
in a report by Politico three weeks ago, which went on to say that the vulnerabilities
exploited
in the hack were known since 2020. The New York Times, citing people familiar with the intrusion,
said
that Russia was ‚Äúat least partly responsible‚Äù for the hack. ‚ÄúThe federal judiciary‚Äôs current approach to information technology is a severe threat to our national security,‚Äù Wyden wrote. ‚ÄúThe courts have been entrusted with some of our nation‚Äôs most confidential and sensitive information, including national security documents that could reveal sources and methods to our adversaries, and sealed criminal charging and investigative documents that could enable suspects to flee from justice or target witnesses.‚Äù
Law Enforcement Freezes $50M in Crypto Assets Tied to Romance Baiting Scams
‚Äî Several cryptocurrency companies, including Chainalysis, OKX, Binance, and Tether, have come together to freeze nearly $50 million stolen via ‚Äúromance baiting‚Äù scams in collaboration with APAC-based authorities.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOnce funds were transferred, scammers then sent proceeds to a consolidation wallet which transferred $46.9 million in USDT [Tether] to a collection of three intermediary addresses,‚Äù Chainalysis
said
. ‚ÄúThe funds then moved to five different wallets.‚Äù The funds were frozen by Tether in July 2024. South Korea Extradites Chinese National for Cyber Attacks
‚Äî South Korean authorities have successfully
extradited
a 34-year-old Chinese national suspected of orchestrating one of the most sophisticated hacking operations targeting high-profile individuals and financial institutions. He is alleged to have stolen 38 billion won from financial accounts and virtual asset accounts.</p>

<p>Anthropic and OpenAI Test Each Other‚Äôs AI
‚Äî OpenAI has called on AI firms to test their rivals‚Äô systems for safety, as the company and Anthropic
conducted
safety evaluations
of each other‚Äôs AI systems to
tackle
risks
like prompt injection and model poisoning. The development came as Anthropic
revealed
that a cybercriminal abused its agentic AI coding tool to automate a large-scale data theft and extortion campaign, marking a ‚Äúnew evolution‚Äù in how AI is super-charging cybercrime. The chatbot then analyzed the companies‚Äô hacked financial documents to help arrive at a realistic amount of bitcoin to demand in exchange for not leaking the stolen material. It also wrote suggested extortion emails.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe operation demonstrates a concerning evolution in AI-assisted cybercrime, where AI serves as both a technical consultant and active operator, enabling attacks that would be more difficult and time-consuming for individual actors to execute manually.‚Äù Where years of specialized training once throttled the ability of bad actors to pull off attacks at scale, the new wave of AI-assisted cybercrime could further lower technical barriers, allowing even novices and unskilled operators to carry out complex activities with ease. Separately, Anthropic has
announced
a policy change to train its AI chatbot Claude with user data, giving existing users until September 28, 2025, to either opt in or opt out to continue using the service; it says it will enable the company to deliver ‚Äúeven more capable, useful AI models‚Äù and strengthen safeguards against harmful usage like scams and abuse. Plex Servers Susceptible to New Flaw
‚Äî Plex has addressed a security vulnerability (CVE-2025-34158), stemming from incorrect resource transfer between spheres, affecting Plex Media Server versions 1.41.7.x to 1.42.0.x. It has been patched in versions 1.42.1.10060 or later.</p>

<p>According to
data
from Censys, there are 428,083 devices exposing the Plex Media Server web interface, although not all of them are necessarily vulnerable. Fake Recipe and Guide Sites Drop Malware
‚Äî Bogus sites masquerading as image, recipe, and educational guide finders have been found to harbor stealthy code to issue
stealthy commands
and

How to Lock Down Your MCP Servers ‚Äî
AI tools like GitHub Copilot are getting smarter every day.</p>

<p>With the Model Context Protocol (MCP), they can connect to outside tools and services‚Äîrunning code, pulling data, or even talking to internal systems. That‚Äôs powerful, but it‚Äôs also risky: if a bad actor sneaks in with a fake or compromised MCP server, your AI could be tricked into leaking secrets, exposing credentials, or executing harmful commands. The solution isn‚Äôt to avoid MCP. It‚Äôs to secure it properly.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs a practical way to do that using free tools. 1. Test Before You Trust:
Before turning on any MCP server, run an audit. Tool to try:
MCPSafetyScanner
What it does: Scans MCP definitions, runs test attacks, and reports if something looks unsafe.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Wrap Servers with a Safety Net:
Don‚Äôt expose servers directly. Add a guard layer. Tool to try: MCP Guardian (open-source prototype from research).</li>
</ol>

<p>What it does: Adds authentication, logs all activity, and blocks suspicious requests. 3. Stress-Test Like an Attacker:
Simulate real-world threats to see how your setup holds up. Tool to try:
MCPSecBench
What it does: Launches different known MCP attack patterns and measures resilience.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Enforce Rules as Code:
Add guardrails for what AI can and can‚Äôt do. Tools to try:
Open Policy Agent
(OPA) or
Kyverno
What they do: Define policies (e.g., ‚Äúonly read from X API, never write‚Äù) and enforce them automatically. 5.</li>
</ol>

<p>Go Zero-Trust on Access:
Every connection should be verified and limited. Use OAuth 2.1 for authorization. Add mTLS (mutual TLS) so both client and server prove who they are. Send all logs to your SIEM (e.g., Elastic or Grafana Loki) for monitoring.</p>

<p>AI + MCP is moving fast. The line between ‚Äúhelpful automation‚Äù and ‚Äúsecurity hole‚Äù is thin. By auditing, stress-testing, enforcing rules, and monitoring, you‚Äôre not just protecting against today‚Äôs risks‚Äîyou‚Äôre preparing for tomorrow‚Äôs. Think of it like this: MCP gives your AI superpowers.</p>

<p>Your job is to make sure those powers don‚Äôt get hijacked. Conclusion
Quantum-safe encryption, AI-driven phishing, identity without passwords‚Äîthese are not distant theories anymore. They are already shaping the security landscape quietly, underneath the day-to-day headlines. The closing lesson: the biggest shocks often arrive not as breaking news, but as trends that grow slowly until suddenly they cannot be ignored.</p>

<h2 id="when-browsers-become-the-attack-surface-rethinking-security-for-scattered-spider"><a id="article-9"></a>When Browsers Become the Attack Surface: Rethinking Security for Scattered Spider</h2>

<p>As enterprises continue to shift their operations to the browser, security teams face a growing set of cyber challenges. In fact, over 80% of security incidents now originate from web applications accessed via Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and other browsers. One particularly fast-evolving adversary, Scattered Spider, has made it their mission to wreak havoc on enterprises by specifically targeting sensitive data on these browsers. Scattered Spider, also referred to as UNC3944, Octo Tempest, or Muddled Libra, has matured over the past two years through precision targeting of human identity and browser environments.</p>

<p>This shift differentiates them from other notorious cybergangs like Lazarus Group, Fancy Bear, and REvil. If sensitive information such as your calendar, credentials, or security tokens is alive and well in browser tabs, Scattered Spider is able to acquire them. In this article, you‚Äôll learn details about Scattered Spider‚Äôs attack methods and how you can stop them in their tracks. Overall, this is a wake-up call to CISOs everywhere to elevate the organization‚Äôs browser security from an ancillary control to a central pillar of their defense.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Scattered Spider‚Äôs Browser-Focused Attack Chain</dt>
  <dt>Scattered Spider avoids high-volume phishing in favor of precision exploitation. This is done by leveraging users‚Äô trust in their most used daily application, stealing saved credentials, and manipulating browser runtime. Browser Tricks</dt>
  <dd>Techniques like Browser-in-the-Browser (BitB) overlays and auto-fill extraction are used to steal credentials while evading detection by traditional security tools like Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR). Session Token Theft</dd>
  <dd>Scattered Spider and other attackers will bypass Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to capture tokens and personal cookies from the browser‚Äôs memory.</dd>
  <dt>Malicious Extensions &amp; JavaScript Injection</dt>
  <dd>Malicious payloads get delivered through fake extensions and execute in-browser via drive-by techniques and other advanced methods. Browser-Based Reconnaissance</dd>
  <dd>Web APIs and the probing of installed extensions allow these attackers to gain access map critical internal systems. For a full technical breakdown of these tactics, see
Scattered Spider Inside the Browser: Tracing Threads of Compromise. Strategic Browser-Layer Security: A Blueprint for CISOs
To counteract Scattered Spider and other advanced browser threats, CISOs must utilize a multi-layered browser security strategy across the following domains.</dd>
</dl>

<ol>
  <li>Stop Credential Theft with Runtime Script Protection
Phishing attacks have been around for decades. Attackers like Scattered Spider, however, have advanced their techniques tenfold in recent years. These advanced phishing campaigns are now relying on malicious JavaScript executions that are executed directly inside the browser, bypassing security tools like EDR.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is done to steal user credentials and other sensitive data. In order to successfully block phishing overlays and intercept dangerous patterns that steal credentials, organizations must implement JavaScript runtime protection to analyze behavior. By applying such protection, security leaders can stop attackers from gaining access and stealing credentials before it‚Äôs too late. 2.</p>

<p>Prevent Account Takeovers by Protecting Sessions
Once user credentials get into the wrong hands, attackers like Scattered Spider will move quickly to hijack previously authenticated sessions by stealing cookies and tokens. Securing the integrity of browser sessions can best be achieved by restricting unauthorized scripts from gaining access or exfiltrating these sensitive artifacts. Organizations must enforce contextual security policies based on components such as device posture, identity verification, and network trust. By linking session tokens to context, enterprises can prevent attacks like account takeovers, even after credentials have become compromised.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Enforce Extension Governance and Block Rogue Scripts
Browser extensions have become extremely popular in recent years, with Google Chrome featuring
130,000+
for download on the Chrome Web Store. While they can serve as productivity boosters, they have also become attack vectors. Malicious or poorly vetted extensions can request invasive permissions, inject malicious scripts into the browser, or act as the delivery system for attack payloads.</li>
</ol>

<p>Enterprises must enforce robust extension governance to allow pre-approved extensions with validated permissions. Equally important is the need to block untrusted scripts before they execute. This approach ensures that legitimate extensions remain available, so the user‚Äôs workflow is not disrupted. 4.</p>

<p>Disrupt Reconnaissance Without Breaking Legitimate Workflows
Attackers like Scattered Spider will often begin attacks through in-browser reconnaissance. They do this by using APIs such as WebRTC, CORS, or fingerprinting to map the environment. This allows them to identify frequently used applications or track specific user behavior. To stop this reconnaissance, organizations must disable or replace sensitive APIs with decoys that deliver incorrect information to the attacking group.</p>

<p>However, adaptive policies are needed to avoid the breaking of legitimate workflows, which are particularly important in BYOD and unmanaged devices. 5. Integrate Browser Telemetry into Actionable Security Intelligence
Although browser security is the last mile of defense for malware-less attacks, integrating it into an existing security stack will fortify the entire network. By implementing activity logs enriched with browser data into SIEM, SOAR, and ITDR platforms, CISOs can correlate browser events with endpoint activity for a much fuller picture.</p>

<p>This will enable SOC teams to gain faster incident responses and better support threat hunting activities. Doing so can improve alert times on attacks and strengthen the overall security posture of an organization. Browser Security Use Cases and Business Impacts

Recommendations for Security Leadership
Assess Your Risk Posture:
Use tools like Browser
Total‚Ñ¢
to determine where browser vulnerabilities lie across your organization.</p>

<p>Enable Browser Protection:
Deploy a solution that‚Äôs capable of real-time JavaScript protection, token security, extension oversight, and telemetry across Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, and all other browsers. Define Contextual Policies:
Enforce rules on web APIs, the capturing of credentials, installing web extensions, and downloads. Integrate with Your Existing Stack:
Feed browser-enabled threat telemetry into SIEM, SOAR, or EDR tools that you already use daily. This will enrich your detection and response capabilities.</p>

<p>Educate Your Team:
Cement browser security as a core principle of your Zero Trust architecture, SaaS protection, and BYOD access. Continuously Test and Validate:
Simulate real browser-based attacks so you can validate your defenses and learn where your blind spots may be. Harden Identity Access Across Browsers:
Put adaptive authentication in place that continuously validates identity within each session. Regularly Audit Browser Extensions:
Develop review processes to keep track of all extensions in use.</p>

<p>Apply Least-Privilege to Web APIs:
Restrict sensitive browser APIs to only the business apps that require them. Automate Browser Threat Hunting:
Leverage browser telemetry and integrate the data with your existing stack to hunt for suspicious patterns. Final Thought: Browsers as the New Identity Perimeter
The Scattered Spider group personifies how attackers can evolve their tactics from targeting an endpoint to focusing on the enterprise‚Äôs most used application, the browser. They do so to steal identities, take over sessions, and remain inside a user‚Äôs environment without a trace.</p>

<p>CISOs must adapt and use browser-native security controls to stop these identity-based threats. Investing in a frictionless, runtime-aware security platform is the answer. Instead of being reactionary, security teams can stop attacks at the source. For all security leaders, enterprise browser protection doesn‚Äôt just work to mitigate attackers like Scattered Spider; it fortifies the window into your enterprise and upgrades the security posture for all SaaS applications, remote work, and beyond.</p>

<h2 id="scarcruft-uses-rokrat-malware-in-operation-hankook-phantom-targeting-south-korean-academics"><a id="article-10"></a>ScarCruft Uses RokRAT Malware in Operation HanKook Phantom Targeting South Korean Academics</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new phishing campaign undertaken by the North Korea-linked hacking group called
ScarCruft
(aka APT37) to deliver a malware known as RokRAT. The activity has been codenamed Operation HanKook Phantom by Seqrite Labs, stating the attacks appear to target individuals associated with the National Intelligence Research Association, including academic figures, former government officials, and researchers. ‚ÄúThe attackers likely aim to steal sensitive information, establish persistence, or conduct espionage,‚Äù security researcher Dixit Panchal
said
in a report published last week. The starting point of the attack chain is a spear-phishing email containing a lure for ‚ÄúNational Intelligence Research Society Newsletter‚ÄîIssue 52,‚Äù a periodic newsletter issued by a South Korean research group focused on national intelligence, labour relations, security, and energy issues.</p>

<p>The digital missive contains a ZIP archive attachment that contains a Windows shortcut (LNK) masquerading as a PDF document, which, when opened, launches the newsletter as a decoy while dropping RokRAT on the infected host. RokRAT
is a known malware associated with APT37, with the tool capable of collecting system information, executing arbitrary commands, enumerating the file system, capturing screenshots, and downloading additional payloads. The gathered data is exfiltrated via Dropbox, Google Cloud, pCloud, and Yandex Cloud. Seqrite said it detected a second campaign in which the LNK file serves as a conduit for a PowerShell script that, besides dropping a decoy Microsoft Word document, runs an obfuscated Windows batch script that‚Äôs responsible for deploying a dropper.</p>

<p>The binary then runs a next-stage payload to steal sensitive data from the compromised host while concealing network traffic as a Chrome file upload. The lure document used in this instance is a statement
issued
by Kim Yo Jong, the Deputy Director of the Publicity and Information Department of the Workers‚Äô Party of Korea and, dated July 28, rejecting Seoul‚Äôs efforts at reconciliation. ‚ÄúThe analysis of this campaign highlights how APT37 (ScarCruft/InkySquid) continues to employ highly tailored spear-phishing attacks, leveraging malicious LNK loaders, fileless PowerShell execution, and covert exfiltration mechanisms,‚Äù Panchal said. ‚ÄúThe attackers specifically target South Korean government sectors, research institutions, and academics with the objective of intelligence gathering and long-term espionage.‚Äù
The development comes as cybersecurity company QiAnXin
detailed
attacks mounted by the infamous Lazarus Group (aka QiAnXin) using
ClickFix
-style tactics to trick job seekers into downloading a supposed NVIDIA-related update to address camera or microphone issues when providing a video assessment.</p>

<p>Details of this activity were
previously disclosed
by Gen Digital in late July 2025. The ClickFix attack results in the execution of a Visual Basic Script that leads to the deployment of
BeaverTail
, a JavaScript stealer that can also deliver a Python-based backdoor dubbed InvisibleFerret. Furthermore, the attacks pave the way for a backdoor with command execution and file read/write capabilities. The disclosure also follows new sanctions
imposed
by the U.S.</p>

<p>Department of the Treasury‚Äôs Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) against two individuals and two entities for their role in the North Korean remote information technology (IT) worker scheme to generate illicit revenue for the regime‚Äôs weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs. The Chollima Group, in a report released last week, detailed its investigation into an IT Worker cluster affiliated with
Moonstone Sleet
that it tracks as BABYLONGROUP in connection with a blockchain play-to-earn (P2E) game called
DefiTankLand
. It‚Äôs assessed that Logan King, the supposed CTO of DefiTankLand, is actually a North Korean IT Worker, a hypothesis bolstered by the fact that King‚Äôs GitHub account has been used as a reference by a Ukrainian freelancer and blockchain developer named ‚ÄúIvan Kovch.‚Äù
‚ÄúMany members had previously worked on a huge cryptocurrency project on behalf of a shady company called ICICB (who we believe to be a front), that one of the non-DPRK members of the cluster runs the Chinese cybercrime market FreeCity, and an interesting connection between DeTankZone and an older IT Worker who previously operated out of Tanzania,‚Äù the Chollima Group
said
. ‚ÄúWhile the DefiTankLand CEO Nabil Amrani has worked previously with Logan on other blockchain projects, we do not believe he is responsible for any of the development.</p>

<p>This all means that the ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù game behind Moonstone Sleet‚Äôs DeTankZone was in fact developed by DPRK IT Workers, only to be later picked up and used by a North Korean APT Group.‚Äù

<h2 id="attackers-abuse-velociraptor-forensic-tool-to-deploy-visual-studio-code-for-c2-tunneling"><a id="article-11"></a>Attackers Abuse Velociraptor Forensic Tool to Deploy Visual Studio Code for C2 Tunneling</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have called attention to a cyber attack in which unknown threat actors deployed an open-source endpoint monitoring and digital forensic tool called
Velociraptor
, illustrating ongoing abuse of legitimate software for malicious purposes. ‚ÄúIn this incident, the threat actor used the tool to download and execute Visual Studio Code with the likely intention of
creating a tunnel
to an attacker-controlled command-and-control (C2) server,‚Äù the Sophos Counter Threat Unit Research Team
said
in a report published this week. While threat actors are known to adopt living-off-the-land (LotL) techniques or take advantage of legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools in their attacks, the use of Velociraptor signals a tactical evolution, where incident response programs are being used to obtain a foothold and minimize the need for having to deploy their own malware. Further analysis of the incident has revealed that the attackers used the Windows msiexec utility to download an MSI installer from a Cloudflare Workers domain, which serves as a staging ground for other tools used by them, including a Cloudflare tunneling tool and a remote administration utility known as Radmin.</p>

<p>The MSI file is designed to install Velociraptor, which then establishes contact with another Cloudflare Workers domain. The access is then leveraged to download Visual Studio Code from the same staging server using an encoded PowerShell command and execute the source code editor with the tunnel option enabled in order to allow both remote access and remote code execution. The threat actors have also been observed utilizing the msiexec Windows utility again to download additional payloads from the workers[.]dev folder. ‚ÄúOrganizations should monitor for and investigate unauthorized use of Velociraptor and treat observations of this tradecraft as a precursor to ransomware,‚Äù Sophos said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúImplementing an endpoint detection and response system, monitoring for unexpected tools and suspicious behaviors, and following best practices for securing systems and generating backups can mitigate the ransomware threat.‚Äù
The disclosure comes as cybersecurity firms
Hunters
and
Permiso
detailed a malicious campaign that has leveraged Microsoft Teams for initial access, reflecting a growing pattern of threat actors
weaponizing
the platform‚Äôs trusted and deeply embedded role in enterprise-focused communications for malware deployment. These attacks begin with the threat actors using newly created or compromised tenants to send direct messages or initiate calls to targets, impersonating IT help desk teams or other trusted contacts to install remote access software like AnyDesk, DWAgent, or Quick Assist, and seize control of victim systems to deliver malware. While
similar techniques
involving remote access tools have been linked to ransomware groups like Black Basta since mid-2024, these newer campaigns forgo the preliminary email bombing step and ultimately make use of the remote access to deliver a PowerShell payload with capabilities commonly associated with credential theft, persistence, and remote code execution. ‚ÄúThe lures used to initiate engagement are tailored to appear routine and unremarkable, typically framed as IT assistance related to Teams performance, system maintenance, or general technical support,‚Äù Permiso researcher Isuf Deliu said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThese scenarios are designed to blend into the background of everyday corporate communication, making them less likely to trigger suspicion.‚Äù
It‚Äôs worth noting that similar tactics have been employed to propagate malware families like
DarkGate
and
Matanbuchus
malware over the past year. The attacks also serve a Windows credential prompt to trick users into entering their passwords under the guise of a benign system configuration request, which are then harvested and saved to a text file on the system. ‚ÄúMicrosoft Teams phishing isn‚Äôt a fringe technique anymore ‚Äî it‚Äôs an active, evolving threat that bypasses traditional email defenses and exploits trust in collaboration tools,‚Äù security researchers Alon Klayman and Tomer Kachlon said. ‚ÄúBy monitoring audit logs like ChatCreated and MessageSent, enriching signals with contextual data, and training users to spot IT/help desk impersonations, SOC teams can close this new gap before it‚Äôs exploited.‚Äù
The findings also follow the discovery of a novel malvertising campaign that combines legitimate office[.]com links with Active Directory Federation Services (
ADFS
) to redirect users to Microsoft 365 phishing pages that are capable of harvesting login information.</p>

<p>The attack chain, in a nutshell, begins when a victim clicks on a rogue sponsored link on search engine results pages, triggering a redirect chain that ultimately leads them to a fake login page mimicking Microsoft. ‚ÄúIt turns out the attacker had set up a custom Microsoft tenant with Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) configured,‚Äù Push Security‚Äôs Luke Jennings
said
. ‚ÄúThis means Microsoft will perform the redirect to the custom malicious domain.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhile this isn‚Äôt a vulnerability per se, the ability for attackers to add their own Microsoft ADFS server to host their phishing page and have Microsoft redirect to it is a concerning development that will make URL-based detections even more challenging than they already are.‚Äù

<h2 id="whatsapp-patches-zero-click-exploit-targeting-ios-and-macos-devices"><a id="article-12"></a>WhatsApp Patches Zero-Click Exploit Targeting iOS and macOS Devices</h2>

<p>WhatsApp has addressed a security vulnerability in its messaging apps for Apple iOS and macOS that it said may have been exploited in the wild in conjunction with a recently disclosed Apple flaw in targeted zero-day attacks. The vulnerability,
CVE-2025-55177
(CVSS score: 5.4), relates to a case of insufficient authorization of linked device synchronization messages. Internal researchers on the WhatsApp Security Team have been credited with discovering and rerating the bug. The Meta-owned company
said
the issue ‚Äúcould have allowed an unrelated user to trigger processing of content from an arbitrary URL on a target‚Äôs device.‚Äù
The flaw affects the following versions -
WhatsApp for iOS prior to version 2.25.21.73 (Patched on July 28, 2025)
WhatsApp Business for iOS version 2.25.21.78 (Patched on August 4, 2025), and
WhatsApp for Mac version 2.25.21.78  (Patched on August 4, 2025)
It also assessed that the shortcoming may have been chained with CVE-2025-43300, a vulnerability affecting iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, as part of a sophisticated attack against specific targeted users.</p>

<p>CVE-2025-43300 was
disclosed
by Apple last week as having been weaponized in an ‚Äúextremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals.‚Äù
The vulnerability in question is an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the ImageIO framework that could result in memory corruption when processing a malicious image. Donncha √ì Cearbhaill, head of the Security Lab at Amnesty International, said WhatsApp has notified an unspecified number of individuals that they believe were targeted by an advanced spyware campaign in the past 90 days using CVE-2025-55177. In the alert sent to the targeted individuals, WhatsApp has also recommended performing a full device factory reset and keeping their operating system and the WhatsApp app up-to-date for optimal protection. It‚Äôs currently not known who, or which spyware vendor, is behind the attacks.</p>

<p>√ì Cearbhaill described the pair of vulnerabilities as a ‚Äúzero-click‚Äù attack, meaning it does not require any user interaction, such as clicking a link, to compromise their device. ‚ÄúEarly indications are that the WhatsApp attack is impacting both iPhone and Android users, civil society individuals among them,‚Äù √ì Cearbhaill
said
. ‚ÄúGovernment spyware continues to pose a threat to journalists and human rights defenders.‚Äù
Update
In a statement shared with The Hacker News, WhatsApp said it sent in-app threat notifications to less than 200 users who may have been targeted as part of the campaign. (The story was updated after publication to clarify that patches were released for the flaw in late July/August 2025.</p>

<p>It was updated again on September 2, 2025, to reflect the latest CVSS score published in the NIST NVD database.)
