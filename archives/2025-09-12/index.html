<h2 id="google-pixel-10-adds-c2pa-support-to-verify-ai-generated-media-authenticity"><a id="article-1"></a>Google Pixel 10 Adds C2PA Support to Verify AI-Generated Media Authenticity</h2>

<p>Google on Tuesday announced that its new Google Pixel 10 phones support the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) standard out of the box to verify the origin and history of digital content. To that end, support for C2PA‚Äôs
Content Credentials
has been added to Pixel Camera and Google Photos apps for Android. The move, Google said, is designed to further digital media transparency. C2PA‚Äôs Content Credentials are a tamper-evident, cryptographically signed digital manifest providing verifiable provenance for digital content such as images, videos, or audio files.</p>

<p>The metadata type, according to
Adobe
, serves as a ‚Äúdigital nutrition label,‚Äù giving information about the creator, how it was made, and if it was generated using artificial intelligence (AI). ‚ÄúThe Pixel Camera app achieved Assurance Level 2, the highest security rating currently defined by the C2PA Conformance Program,‚Äù Google‚Äôs Android Security and C2PA Core teams
said
. ‚ÄúAssurance Level 2 for a mobile app is currently only possible on the Android platform.‚Äù
‚ÄúPixel 10 phones support on-device trusted time-stamps, which ensures images captured with your native camera app can be trusted after the certificate expires, even if they were captured when your device was offline.‚Äù
The capability is made possible using a combination of Google Tensor G5, Titan M2 security chip, and hardware-backed security features built into the Android operating system. Google said it has implemented C2PA to be secure, verifiable, and usable offline, thereby ensuring that provenance data is trustworthy, the process is not personally identifiable, and works even when the device is not connected to the internet.</p>

<p>This is achieved using -
Android Key Attestation
to allow Google C2PA Certification Authorities (CAs) to verify that they are communicating with a genuine physical device
Hardware-backed Android Key Attestation certificates that include the package name and signing certificates associated with the app that requested the generation of the C2PA signing key to verify the request originated from a trusted, registered app
Generating and storing C2PA claim signing keys using Android StrongBox in the Titan M2 security chip for tamper-resistance
Anonymous, hardware-backed attestation to certify new cryptographic keys generated on-device without knowing who is using it
Unique certificates to sign each image, making it ‚Äúcryptographically impossible‚Äù to deanonymize the creator
On-device, offline Time-Stamping Authority (TSA) component within the Tensor chip to generate cryptographically-signed time-stamps when the camera‚Äôs shutter is pressed
‚ÄúC2PA Content Credentials are not the sole solution for identifying the provenance of digital media,‚Äù Google said. ‚ÄúThey are, however, a tangible step toward more media transparency and trust as we continue to unlock more human creativity with AI.‚Äù

<h2 id="senator-wyden-urges-ftc-to-probe-microsoft-for-ransomware-linked-cybersecurity-negligence"><a id="article-2"></a>Senator Wyden Urges FTC to Probe Microsoft for Ransomware-Linked Cybersecurity Negligence</h2>

<p>U.S. Senator Ron Wyden has called on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to probe Microsoft and hold it responsible for what he called ‚Äúgross cybersecurity negligence‚Äù that enabled ransomware attacks on U.S. critical infrastructure, including against healthcare networks. ‚ÄúWithout timely action, Microsoft‚Äôs culture of negligent cybersecurity, combined with its de facto monopolization of the enterprise operating system market, poses a serious national security threat and makes additional hacks inevitable,‚Äù Wyden
wrote
in a four-page letter to FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson, likening Redmond to an ‚Äúarsonist selling firefighting services to their victims.‚Äù
The development comes after Wyden‚Äôs office obtained new information from healthcare system Ascension, which
suffered
a crippling
ransomware attack
last year, resulting in the theft of personal and medical information associated with
nearly 5.6 million individuals
.</p>

<p>The ransomware attack, which also disrupted access to electronic health records, was attributed to a ransomware group known as Black Basta. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the breach has been ranked as the
third-largest healthcare-related incident
over the past year. According to the senator‚Äôs office, the breach occurred when a contractor clicked on a malicious link after conducting a web search on Microsoft‚Äôs Bing search engine, causing their system to be infected with malware.</p>

<p>Subsequently, the attackers leveraged ‚Äúdangerously insecure default settings‚Äù on Microsoft software to obtain elevated access to the most sensitive parts of Ascension‚Äôs network. This involved the use of a technique called
Kerberoasting
that targets the Kerberos authentication protocol to extract encrypted service account credentials from Active Directory. Kerberoasting ‚Äúexploits an insecure encryption technology from the 1980s known as ‚ÄòRC4‚Äô that is still supported by Microsoft software in its default configuration,‚Äù Wyden‚Äôs office said, adding it urged Microsoft to warn customers about the threat posed by the threat on July 29, 2024. RC4
, short for Rivest Cipher 4, is a stream cipher that was first developed in 1987.</p>

<p>Originally intended to be a trade secret, it was leaked in a public forum in 1994. As of 2015, the Engineering Task Force (ETF) has
prohibited
the use of RC4 in TLS, citing a ‚Äúvariety of cryptographic weaknesses‚Äù that allow plaintext recovery. Eventually, Microsoft did
publish
an alert in October 2024 outlining the steps users can take to stay protected, in addition to stating its plans to deprecate support for RC4 as a future update to Windows 11 24H2 and Windows Server 2025 -
The accounts most vulnerable to Kerberoasting are those with weak passwords and those that use weaker encryption algorithms, especially RC4. RC4 is more susceptible to the cyberattack because it uses no salt or iterated hash when converting a password to an encryption key, allowing the cyberthreat actor to guess more passwords quickly.</p>

<p>However, other encryption algorithms are still vulnerable when weak passwords are used. While AD will not try to use RC4 by default, RC4 is currently enabled by default, meaning a cyberthreat actor can attempt to request tickets encrypted using RC4. RC4 will be deprecated, and we intend to disable it by default in a future update to Windows 11 24H2 and Windows Server 2025. Microsoft, which
removed support
for the Data Encryption Standard (DES) in Kerberos for Windows Server 2025 and Windows 11, version 24H2 earlier this February, said it has also
introduced
security improvements in Server 2025 that prevent the Kerberos Distribution Center from issuing Ticket Granting Tickets using RC4 encryption, such as RC4-HMAC(NT).</p>

<p>Some of Microsoft‚Äôs recommended mitigations to harden environments against Kerberoasting include -
Using Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA) or Delegated Managed Service Accounts (dMSA) wherever possible
Securing service accounts by setting randomly generated, long passwords that are at least 14 characters long
Making sure all service accounts are configured to use AES (128 and 256 bit) for Kerberos service ticket encryption
Auditing user accounts with Service Principal Names (SPNs)
However, Wyden wrote that Microsoft‚Äôs software does not enforce a 14-character password length for privileged accounts, and that the company‚Äôs continued support for the insecure RC4 encryption technology ‚Äúneedlessly exposes‚Äù its customers to ransomware and other cyber threats by allowing attackers to crack the passwords of privileged accounts. The Hacker News has reached out to Microsoft for comment, and we will update the story if we hear back. This is not the first time the Windows maker has been blasted for its cybersecurity practices. In a report released last year, U.S.</p>

<p>Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB)
lambasted
the company for a series of avoidable errors that could have prevented Chinese threat actors known as Storm-0558 from compromising the Microsoft Exchange Online mailboxes of 22 organizations and over 500 individuals around the world. ‚ÄúUltimately, Microsoft‚Äôs abysmal cybersecurity track record has had no impact on its lucrative federal contracts thanks to its dominant market position and inaction by government agencies in the face of the company‚Äôs string of security failures,‚Äù Wyden‚Äôs office argued. ‚ÄúThe letter underscores a long-standing tension in enterprise cybersecurity, the balance between legacy system support and secure-by-default design,‚Äù Ensar Seker, CISO at SOCRadar, said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about systemic risk inherited from default configurations and the architectural complexity of widely adopted software ecosystems like Microsoft‚Äôs.</p>

<p>When a single vendor becomes foundational to national infrastructure, their security design decisions, or lack thereof, can have cascading consequences.‚Äù
‚ÄúUltimately, this isn‚Äôt about blaming one company. It‚Äôs about recognizing that national security is now tightly coupled with the configuration defaults of dominant IT platforms. Enterprises and public sector agencies alike need to demand more secure-by-design defaults and be ready to adapt when they‚Äôre offered.‚Äù

<h2 id="cracking-the-boardroom-code-helping-cisos-speak-the-language-of-business"><a id="article-3"></a>Cracking the Boardroom Code: Helping CISOs Speak the Language of Business</h2>

<p>CISOs know their field. They understand the threat landscape. They understand how to build a strong and cost-effective security stack. They understand how to staff out their organization.</p>

<p>They understand the intricacies of compliance. They understand what it takes to reduce risk. Yet one question comes up again and again in our conversations with these security leaders:
how do I make the impact of risk clear to business decision-makers? Boards want to hear how risk affects revenue, governance, and growth.</p>

<p>They have a limited attention span for lists of vulnerabilities or technical details. When the story gets too technical, even urgent initiatives lose traction and fail to get funded. CISOs need to translate technical issues into terms the board understands. Doing so builds trust, garners support and shows how security decisions connect directly to long-term growth.</p>

<p>It was the urgent need to bridge the CISO-Board communication gap that led us to create a new paradigm in CISO continuing education:
Risk Reporting to the Board for Modern CISOs
. The Disconnect Between Boards and CISOs
Boards are increasingly held accountable for cyber risk. SEC rules
require public companies to disclose cyber incidents within four business days and to describe board cyber oversight in annual reports. In the EU,
NIS2
holds management bodies directly responsible for cybersecurity measures, with penalties up to ‚Ç¨10 million or 2% of global turnover.</p>

<p>Boards track governance, liability, and enterprise value. CISOs present threats, vulnerabilities, and controls. Surveys confirm this gap:
Gartner‚Äôs 2024 Board of Directors Survey
reports that 84% of directors classify cybersecurity as a business risk, yet research finds that only about half of boards rate their understanding as strong enough for effective oversight. CISO-Board alignment has never been more important, but the two sides still speak different languages.</p>

<p>This challenge surfaced so often in our conversations with security leaders that it led us to a simple conclusion: if so many experienced professionals need this skill,
it should be taught. Teaching How to Close the Boardroom Gap
The goal was clear: boards need insights that connect cyber risk to business outcomes. Risk Reporting to the Board for Modern CISOs
was built from scratch to help security leaders meet that need. The course teaches CISOs how to reframe their message in ways that resonate with directors.</p>

<p>It focuses on practical skills: moving beyond vanity metrics to dashboards that answer the ‚ÄúSo what?‚Äù question, building concise presentations that boards can act on, anticipating and managing difficult questions, and framing budget requests in financial and strategic terms. The course also introduces Continuous Threat Exposure Management as a model for presenting risk in a structured, forward-looking way. Each of the five lessons is designed to be practical and easy to apply. Participants leave with methods and templates they can use in their next board meeting.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>The key areas of focus include:</dt>
  <dt>The Board‚Äôs View of Risk</dt>
  <dd>What directors focus on and how to frame security as an enabler of safe innovation and competitive advantage. Clear Risk Communication</dd>
  <dd>Moving past vanity metrics by building dashboards that tell a risk story that ties technical findings to business impact. High-Impact Presentations</dd>
  <dd>Creating concise, effective board presentations, aligning with key executives in advance, and handling difficult questions with confidence. Stronger Business Cases</dd>
  <dd>Translating security needs into financial and strategic language.</dd>
  <dt>Building requests around risk reduction value, total cost of ownership, and alignment with company objectives. Operationalizing CTEM</dt>
  <dd>Applying the five stages of Continuous Threat Exposure Management to strengthen security posture and structure reporting in a forward-looking way. The course is led by Dr. Gerald Auger, whose career spans more than twenty years in both industry and academia.</dd>
</dl>

<p>He served as cybersecurity architect for a major medical center and has taught tens of thousands of students through his Simply Cyber platform. His mix of practical and teaching experience makes the course grounded, relevant, and directly useful for CISOs in the boardroom. The Bottom Line
Cybersecurity is at the center of business oversight. Boards expect insight that is clear and actionable, and CISOs need to present risk in terms that connect directly to governance, finance, and strategy.</p>

<p>Risk Reporting to the Board for Modern CISOs
was designed with these challenges in mind. The course gives security leaders practical tools to translate their expertise into language the board can act on. When CISOs build these skills, they move from talking about technical metrics to explaining risk in terms that link to business goals and show how security drives long-term growth. That leads to clearer conversations with directors, steadier support for security programs, and a stronger role for cybersecurity in the company‚Äôs overall strategy.</p>

<h2 id="sonicwall-ssl-vpn-flaw-and-misconfigurations-actively-exploited-by-akira-ransomware-hackers"><a id="article-4"></a>SonicWall SSL VPN Flaw and Misconfigurations Actively Exploited by Akira Ransomware Hackers</h2>

<p>Threat actors affiliated with the Akira ransomware group have continued to target SonicWall devices for initial access. Cybersecurity firm Rapid7
said
it observed a spike in intrusions involving SonicWall appliances over the past month, particularly
following reports
about renewed Akira ransomware activity since late July 2025. SonicWall subsequently
revealed
the SSL VPN activity aimed at its firewalls involved a year-old security flaw (
CVE-2024-40766
, CVSS score: 9.3) where local user passwords were carried over during the migration and not reset. ‚ÄúWe are observing increased threat activity from actors attempting to brute-force user credentials,‚Äù the company
noted
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúTo mitigate risk, customers should enable Botnet Filtering to block known threat actors and ensure Account Lockout policies are enabled.‚Äù
SonicWall has also
urged
users to review LDAP SSL VPN Default User Groups, describing it as a ‚Äúcritical weak point‚Äù if misconfigured in the context of an Akira ransomware attack ‚Äì
This setting automatically adds every successfully authenticated LDAP user to a predefined local group, regardless of their actual membership in Active Directory. If that default group has access to sensitive services ‚Äì such as SSL VPN, administrative interfaces, or unrestricted network zones ‚Äì then any compromised AD account, even one with no legitimate need for those services, will instantly inherit those permissions. This effectively bypasses intended AD group-based access controls, giving attackers a direct path into the network perimeter as soon as they obtain valid credentials. Rapid7, in its alert, said it has also observed threat actors accessing the Virtual Office Portal hosted by SonicWall appliances, which, in certain default configurations, can facilitate public access and enable attackers to configure mMFA/TOTP with valid accounts, assuming there is a prior credential exposure.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe Akira group is potentially utilizing a combination of all three of these security risks to gain unauthorized access and conduct ransomware operations,‚Äù it said. To mitigate the risk, organizations are advised to rotate passwords on all SonicWall local accounts, remove any unused or inactive SonicWall local accounts, ensure MFA/TOTP policies are configured, and restrict Virtual Office Portal access to the internal network. Akira‚Äôs targeting of SonicWall SSL VPNs has also been
echoed
by the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), which acknowledged it‚Äôs aware of the ransomware gang striking vulnerable Australian organizations through the devices. Since its debut in March 2023,
Akira
has been a persistent threat in the ransomware threat landscape, claiming 967 victims to date, as per information from
Ransomware.Live
.</p>

<p>According to statistics
shared
by CYFIRMA, Akira accounted for 40 attacks in the month of July 2025, making it the third most active group after Qilin and INC Ransom. Of the 657 ransomware attacks impacting industrial entities worldwide flagged in Q2 2025, Qilin, Akira, and Play ransomware families took the top three slots, each reporting 101, 79, and 75 incidents, respectively. Akira maintained ‚Äúsubstantial activity with consistent targeting of manufacturing and transportation sectors through sophisticated phishing and multi-platform ransomware deployments,‚Äù industrial cybersecurity company Dragos
said
in a report published last month. Recent Akira ransomware infections have also
leveraged
search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning techniques to deliver trojanized installers for popular IT management tools, which are then used to drop the Bumblebee malware loader.</p>

<p>The attacks then utilize Bumblebee as a conduit to distribute the AdaptixC2 post-exploitation and adversarial emulation framework, install RustDesk for persistent remote access, exfiltrate data, and deploy the ransomware. According to
Palo Alto Networks Unit 42
, the versatile and modular nature of AdaptixC2 can allow threat actors to execute commands, transfer files, and perform data exfiltration on infected systems. The fact that it‚Äôs also open-source means it can be customized by adversaries to fit their needs. Other campaigns propagating AdaptixC2, the cybersecurity company said, have used
Microsoft Teams calls
mimicking IT help desk to trick unsuspecting users into granting them remote access via Quick Assist and drop a PowerShell script that decrypts and loads into memory the shellcode payload.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe Akira ransomware group follows a standard attack flow: obtaining initial access via the SSLVPN component, escalating privileges to an elevated account or service account, locating and stealing sensitive files from network shares or file servers, deleting or stopping backups, and deploying ransomware encryption at the hypervisor level,‚Äù Rapid7 said.

<h2 id="fake-madgicx-plus-and-socialmetrics-extensions-are-hijacking-meta-business-accounts"><a id="article-5"></a>Fake Madgicx Plus and SocialMetrics Extensions Are Hijacking Meta Business Accounts</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed two new campaigns that are serving fake browser extensions using malicious ads and fake websites to steal sensitive data. The malvertising campaign, per
Bitdefender
, is designed to push fake ‚Äú
Meta Verified
‚Äú browser extensions named
SocialMetrics Pro
that claim to unlock the blue check badge for Facebook and Instagram profiles. At least 37 malicious ads have been observed serving the extension in question. ‚ÄúThe malicious ads are bundled with a video tutorial that guides viewers through the process of downloading and installing a so-called browser extension, which claims to unlock the blue verification tick on Facebook or other special features,‚Äù the Romanian cybersecurity vendor said.</p>

<p>But, in reality, the extension ‚Äì which is hosted on a legitimate cloud service called Box ‚Äì is capable of collecting session cookies from Facebook and sending them to a Telegram bot controlled by the attackers. It‚Äôs also equipped to obtain the victim‚Äôs IP address by sending a query to ipinfo[.]io/json. Select variants of the rogue browser add-on have been observed using the stolen cookies to interact with the Facebook Graph API to likely fetch additional information related to the accounts. In the past, malware like
NodeStealer
has leveraged the Facebook Graph API to collect budget details of the account.</p>

<p>The end goal of these efforts is to sell valuable Facebook Business and Ads accounts on underground forums for profit to other fraudsters, or repurpose them to fuel more malvertising campaigns, which, in turn, leads to more hijacked accounts ‚Äì effectively creating a self-perpetuating cycle. The campaign exhibits all the ‚Äúfingerprints‚Äù typically associated with
Vietnamese-speaking
threat actors, who are
known
to
adopt
various
stealer families
to target and gain unauthorized access to Facebook accounts. This hypothesis is also bolstered by the use of Vietnamese to narrate the tutorial and add source code comments. ‚ÄúBy using a trusted platform, attackers can mass-generate links, automatically embed them into tutorials, and continuously refresh their campaigns,‚Äù Bitdefender said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis fits a larger pattern of attackers industrializing malvertising, where everything from ad images to tutorials is created en masse.‚Äù
The disclosure coincides with another campaign that‚Äôs targeting Meta advertisers with rogue Chrome extensions distributed via counterfeit websites posing as artificial intelligence (AI)-powered ad optimization tools for Facebook and Instagram. At the heart of the operation is a fake platform named
Madgicx Plus
. ‚ÄúPromoted as a tool to streamline campaign management and boost ROI using artificial intelligence, the extension instead delivers potentially malicious functionalities capable of hijacking business sessions, stealing credentials, and compromising Meta Business accounts,‚Äù Cybereason
said
. ‚ÄúThe extensions are promoted as productivity or ad performance enhancers, but they operate as dual-purpose malware capable of stealing credentials, accessing session tokens, or enabling account takeover.</p>

<p>The extensions, the first of which is still available for download from the Chrome Web Store as of writing, are listed below -
Madgicx Plus - The SuperApp for Meta Advertisers (ID:
eoalbaojjblgndkffciljmiddhgjdldh
) - Published in February 2025 (28 Installs)
Meta Ads SuperTool (ID:
cpigbbjhchinhpamicodkkcpihjjjlia
) - Published in March 2025 (11 Installs)
Madgicx X Ads - The SuperApp for Meta Advertisers (ID:
cpigbbjhchinhpamicodkkcpihjjjlia
) - Published in March 2025 (3 Installs)
Once installed, the extension gains full access to all websites the user visits, enabling the threat actors to inject arbitrary scripts, as well as intercept and modify network traffic, monitor browsing activity, capture form inputs, and harvest sensitive data. It also prompts users to link their Facebook and Google accounts to access the service, while their identity information is covertly harvested in the background. Furthermore, the add-ons function similarly to the aforementioned fake Meta Verified extension in that it uses victims‚Äô stolen Facebook credentials to interact with the Facebook Graph API. ‚ÄúThis staged approach reveals a clear threat-actor strategy: first capturing Google identity data, then pivoting to Facebook to broaden access and increase the chances of hijacking valuable business or advertising assets,‚Äù Cybereason said.</p>

<h2 id="asyncrat-exploits-connectwise-screenconnect-to-steal-credentials-and-crypto"><a id="article-6"></a>AsyncRAT Exploits ConnectWise ScreenConnect to Steal Credentials and Crypto</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a new campaign that leverages ConnectWise ScreenConnect, a legitimate Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) software, to deliver a fleshless loader that drops a remote access trojan (RAT) called
AsyncRAT
to steal sensitive data from compromised hosts. ‚ÄúThe attacker used ScreenConnect to gain remote access, then executed a layered VBScript and PowerShell loader that fetched and ran obfuscated components from external URLs,‚Äù LevelBlue
said
in a report shared with The Hacker News. ‚ÄúThese components included encoded .NET assemblies ultimately unpacking into AsyncRAT while maintaining persistence via a fake ‚ÄòSkype Updater‚Äô scheduled task.‚Äù
In the infection chain documented by the cybersecurity company, the threat actors have been found to leverage a ScreenConnect deployment to initiate a remote session and launch a Visual Basic Script payload via hands-on-keyboard activity. ‚ÄúWe saw trojanized ScreenConnect installers masquerading as financial and other business documents being sent via phishing emails,‚Äù Sean Shirley, LevelBlue MDR SOC Analyst, told The Hacker News.</p>

<p>The script, for its part, is designed to retrieve two external payloads (‚Äúlogs.ldk‚Äù and ‚Äúlogs.ldr‚Äù) from an attacker-controlled server by means of a PowerShell script. The first of the two files, ‚Äúlogs.ldk,‚Äù is a DLL that‚Äôs responsible for writing a secondary Visual Basic Script to disk, using it to establish persistence using a scheduled task by passing it off as ‚ÄúSkype Updater‚Äù to evade detection. This Visual Basic Script contains the same PowerShell logic observed at the start of the attack. The scheduled task ensures that the payload is automatically executed after every login.</p>

<p>The PowerShell script, besides loading ‚Äúlogs.ldk‚Äù as a .NET assembly, passes ‚Äúlogs.ldr‚Äù as input to the loaded assembly, leading to the execution of a binary (‚ÄúAsyncClient.exe‚Äù), which is the AsyncRAT payload with capabilities to log keystrokes, steal browser credentials , fingerprint the system, and scan for installed cryptocurrency wallet desktop apps and browser extensions in Google Chrome, Brave, Microsoft Edge, Opera, and Mozilla Firefox. All this collected information is eventually exfiltrated to a command-and-control (C2) server (‚Äú3osch20.duckdns[.]org‚Äù) over a TCP socket, to which the malware beacons in order to execute payloads and receive post-exploitation commands. The C2 connection settings are either hard-coded or pulled from a remote Pastebin URL. ‚ÄúFileless malware continues to pose a significant challenge to modern cybersecurity defenses due to its stealthy nature and reliance on legitimate system tools for execution,‚Äù LevelBlue said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúUnlike traditional malware that writes payloads to disk, fileless threats operate in memory, making them harder to detect, analyze, and eradicate.‚Äù

<h2 id="chinese-apt-deploys-eggstreme-fileless-malware-to-breach-philippine-military-systems"><a id="article-7"></a>Chinese APT Deploys EggStreme Fileless Malware to Breach Philippine Military Systems</h2>

<p>An advanced persistent threat (APT) group from China has been attributed to the compromise of a Philippines-based military company using a previously undocumented fileless malware framework called
EggStreme
. ‚ÄúThis multi-stage toolset achieves persistent, low-profile espionage by injecting malicious code directly into memory and leveraging DLL sideloading to execute payloads,‚Äù Bitdefender researcher Bogdan Zavadovschi
said
in a report shared with The Hacker News. ‚ÄúThe core component, EggStremeAgent, is a full-featured backdoor that enables extensive system reconnaissance, lateral movement, and data theft via an injected keylogger.‚Äù
The targeting of the Philippines is
something
of a
recurring pattern
for Chinese state-sponsored hacking groups, particularly in light of
geopolitical tensions
fueled by territorial disputes in the South China Sea between China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Brunei. However, the latest activity has not been attributed to any known Chinese hacking group.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe put quite a lot of effort into attribution efforts, but couldn‚Äôt find anything,‚Äù Martin Zugec, technical solutions director at Bitdefender, told The Hacker News. ‚ÄúHowever, objectives align with Chinese APTs. For this one, our attribution is based on interests/objectives.‚Äù
The Romanian cybersecurity vendor, which first detected signs of malicious activity in early 2024, described EggStreme as a tightly integrated set of malicious components that‚Äôs engineered to establish a ‚Äúresilient foothold‚Äù on infected machines. The starting point of the multi-stage operation is a payload called EggStremeFuel (‚Äúmscorsvc.dll‚Äù) that conducts system profiling and deploys EggStremeLoader to set up persistence and then executes EggStremeReflectiveLoader, which, in turn, triggers EggStremeAgent.</p>

<p>EggStremeFuel‚Äôs functions are realized by opening an active communication channel with a command-and-control (C2), enabling it to -
Get drive information
Start cmd.exe and establish communication via pipes
Gracefully close all connections and shutdown
Read a file from server and save it to disk
Read a local file from a given path and transmit its content
Send the external IP address by making a request to myexternalip[.]com/raw
Dump the in-memory configuration to disk
Calling EggStremeAgent the ‚Äúcentral nervous system‚Äù of the framework, the backdoor works by monitoring new user sessions and injects a keylogger component dubbed EggStremeKeylogger for each session to harvest keystrokes and other sensitive data. It communicates with a C2 server using the Google Remote Procedure Call (
gRPC
) protocol. It supports an impressive 58 commands that enable a broad range of capabilities to facilitate local and network discovery, system enumeration, arbitrary shellcode execution, privilege escalation, lateral movement, data exfiltration, and payload injection, including an auxiliary implant codenamed EggStremeWizard (‚Äúxwizards.dll‚Äù). ‚ÄúThe attackers use this to launch a legitimate binary that sideloads the malicious DLL, a technique they consistently abuse throughout the attack chain,‚Äù Zavadovschi noted.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis secondary backdoor provides reverse shell access and file upload/download capabilities. Its design also incorporates a list of multiple C2 servers, enhancing its resilience and ensuring that communication with the attacker can be maintained even if one C2 server is taken offline.‚Äù
The activity is also characterized by the use of the
Stowaway
proxy utility to establish an internal network foothold. Complicating detection further is the fileless nature of the framework, causing malicious code to be loaded and executed directly in memory without leaving any traces on disk. ‚ÄúThis, coupled with the heavy use of DLL side-loading and the sophisticated, multi-stage execution flow, allows the framework to operate with a low profile, making it a significant and persistent threat,‚Äù Bitdefender said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe EggStreme malware family is a highly sophisticated and multi-component threat designed to achieve persistent access, lateral movement, and data exfiltration. The threat actor demonstrates an advanced understanding of modern defensive techniques by employing a variety of tactics to evade detection.‚Äù

<h2 id="chillyhell-macos-backdoor-and-zynorrat-rat-threaten-macos-windows-and-linux-systems"><a id="article-8"></a>CHILLYHELL macOS Backdoor and ZynorRAT RAT Threaten macOS, Windows, and Linux Systems</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have discovered two new malware families, including a modular Apple macOS backdoor called
CHILLYHELL
and a Go-based remote access trojan (RAT) named
ZynorRAT
that can target both Windows and Linux systems. According to an
analysis
from Jamf Threat Labs, ChillyHell is written in C++ and is developed for Intel architectures. CHILLYHELL is the name assigned to a malware that‚Äôs attributed to an
uncategorized threat cluster
dubbed UNC4487. The hacking group is assessed to have been active since at least October 2022.</p>

<p>According to threat intelligence
shared
by Google Mandiant, UNC4487 is a suspected espionage actor that has been observed compromising the websites of Ukrainian government entities to redirect and socially engineer targets to execute
Matanbuchus
or CHILLYHELL malware. The Apple device management company said it discovered a new CHILLYHELL sample uploaded to the VirusTotal malware scanning platform on May 2, 2025. The artifact, notarized by Apple back in 2021, is said to have been publicly hosted on Dropbox since then. Apple has since revoked the developer certificates linked to the malware.</p>

<p>Once executed, the malware extensively profiles the compromised host and establishes persistence using three different methods, following which it initializes command-and-control (C2) communication with a hard-coded server (93.88.75[.]252 or 148.72.172[.]53) over HTTP or DNS, and enters into a command loop to receive further instructions from its operators. To set up persistence, CHILLYHELL either installs itself as a
LaunchAgent
or a system LaunchDaemon. As a backup mechanism, it alters the user‚Äôs shell profile (.zshrc, .bash_profile, or .profile) to inject a launch command into the configuration file. A noteworthy tactic adopted by the malware is its use of timestomping to modify the timestamps of created artifacts to avoid raising red flags.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIf it does not have sufficient permission to update the timestamps by means of a direct system call, it will fall back to using shell commands touch -c -a -t and touch -c -m -t respectively, each with a formatted string representing a date from the past as an argument included at the end of the command,‚Äù Jamf researchers Ferdous Saljooki and Maggie Zirnhelt said. CHILLYHELL supports a wide range of commands that allow it to launch a reverse shell to the C2 IP address, download a new version of the malware, fetch additional payloads, run a module named ModuleSUBF to enumerate user accounts from ‚Äú/etc/passwd‚Äù and conduct brute-force attacks using a pre-defined password list retrieved from the C2 server. ‚ÄúBetween its multiple persistence mechanisms, ability to communicate over different protocols and modular structure, ChillyHell is extraordinarily flexible,‚Äù Jamf said. ‚ÄúCapabilities such as timestomping and password cracking make this sample an unusual find in the current macOS threat landscape.‚Äù
‚ÄúNotably, ChillyHell was notarized and serves as an important reminder that not all malicious code comes unsigned.‚Äù
The findings dovetail with the discovery of ZynorRAT, a RAT that uses a Telegram bot called @lraterrorsbot (aka lrat) to commandeer infected Windows and Linux hosts.</p>

<p>Evidence shows that the malware was first submitted to VirusTotal on July 8, 2025. It does not share any overlaps with other known malware families. Compiled with Go, the Linux version supports a wide range of functions to enable file exfiltration, system enumeration, screenshot capture, persistence through systemd services, and arbitrary command execution -
/fs_list, to enumerate directories
/fs_get, to exfiltrate files from the host
/metrics, to perform system profiling
/proc_list, to run the ‚Äúps‚Äù Linux command
/proc_kill, to kill a specific process by passing the PID as input
/capture_display, to take screenshots
/persist, to establish persistence
ZynorRAT‚Äôs Windows version is near-identical to its Linux counterpart, while still resorting to Linux-based persistence mechanisms. This likely indicates that development of the Windows variant is a work in progress.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIts main purpose is to serve as a collection, exfiltration, and remote access tool, which is centrally managed through a Telegram bot,‚Äù Sysdig researcher Alessandra Rizzo
said
. ‚ÄúTelegram serves as the main C2 infrastructure through which the malware receives further commands once deployed on a victim machine.‚Äù
Further analysis of screenshots leaked via the Telegram bot has revealed that the payloads are distributed via a file-sharing service known as Dosya.co, and that the malware author may have ‚Äúinfected‚Äù their own machines to test out the functionality. ZynorRAT is believed to be the work of a lone actor possibly of Turkish origin, given the language used in Telegram chats. ‚ÄúAlthough the malware ecosystem has no shortage of RATs, malware developers are still dedicating their time to creating them from scratch,‚Äù Rizzo said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúZynorRAT‚Äôs customization and automated controls underline the evolving sophistication of modern malware, even within their earliest stages.‚Äù

<h2 id="microsoft-fixes-80-flaws--including-smb-privesc-and-azure-cvss-100-bugs"><a id="article-9"></a>Microsoft Fixes 80 Flaws ‚Äî Including SMB PrivEsc and Azure CVSS 10.0 Bugs</h2>

<p>Microsoft on Tuesday addressed a set of
80 security flaws
in its software, including one vulnerability that has been disclosed as publicly known at the time of release. Of the 80 vulnerabilities, eight are rated Critical and 72 are rated Important in severity. None of the shortcomings has been exploited in the wild as a zero-day. Like
last month
, 38 of the disclosed flaws are related to privilege escalation, followed by remote code execution (22), information disclosure (14), and denial-of-service (3).</p>

<p>‚ÄúFor the third time this year, Microsoft patched more elevation of privilege vulnerabilities than remote code execution flaws,‚Äù Satnam Narang, senior staff research engineer at Tenable, said. ‚ÄúNearly 50% (47.5%) of all bugs this month are privilege escalation vulnerabilities.‚Äù
The patches are in addition to
12 vulnerabilities
addressed in Microsoft‚Äôs Chromium-based Edge browser since the release of August 2025‚Äôs Patch Tuesday update, including a security bypass bug (CVE-2025-53791, CVSS score: 4.7) that has been patched in version 140.0.3485.54 of the browser. The vulnerability that has been flagged as publicly known is
CVE-2025-55234
(CVSS score: 8.8), a case of privilege escalation in Windows SMB. ‚ÄúSMB Server might be susceptible to relay attacks depending on the configuration,‚Äù Microsoft said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAn attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could perform relay attacks and make the users subject to elevation of privilege attacks.‚Äù
The Windows maker said the update enables support for auditing SMB client compatibility for SMB Server signing as well as SMB Server EPA, allowing customers to assess their environment and detect any potential device or software incompatibility issues before deploying
appropriate hardening measures
. ‚ÄúThe key takeaway from the CVE-2025-55234 advisory, other than the explanation of the well-known attack surface around SMB authentication, is that this is one of those times where simply patching isn‚Äôt enough; in fact, the patches provide administrators with more auditing options to determine whether their SMB Server is interacting with clients that won‚Äôt support the recommended hardening options,‚Äù Adam Barnett, lead software engineer at Rapid7, said. Mike Walters, president and co-founder of Action, said the vulnerability stems from the fact that SMB sessions can be established without properly validating the authentication context when key hardening measures, such as SMB signing and Extended Protection for Authentication, are not in place. ‚ÄúThis gap opens the door to man-in-the-middle relay attacks, where attackers can capture and forward authentication material to gain unauthorized access,‚Äù Walters added.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt can easily become part of a larger campaign, moving from phishing to SMB relay, credential theft, lateral movement, and eventually data exfiltration.‚Äù
The CVE with the highest CVSS score for this month, but not listed in the Release Notes, is
CVE-2025-54914
(CVSS score: 10.0), a critical flaw impacting Azure Networking that could result in privilege escalation. It requires no customer action, given that it‚Äôs a cloud-related vulnerability. Two other shortcomings that merit attention include a remote code execution flaw in Microsoft High Performance Compute (HPC) Pack (
CVE-2025-55232
, CVSS score: 9.8) and an elevation of privilege issue affecting Windows NTLM (
CVE-2025-54918
, CVSS score: 8.8) that could allow an attacker to gain SYSTEM privileges. ‚ÄúFrom Microsoft‚Äôs limited description, it appears that if an attacker is able to send specially crafted packets over the network to the target device, they would have the ability to gain SYSTEM-level privileges on the target machine,‚Äù Kev Breen, senior director of threat research at Immersive, said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe patch notes for this vulnerability state that ‚ÄòImproper authentication in Windows NTLM allows an authorized attacker to elevate privileges over a network,‚Äô suggesting an attacker may already need to have access to the NTLM hash or the user‚Äôs credentials.‚Äù
Lastly, the update also remediates a security flaw (
CVE-2024-21907
, CVSS score: 7.5) in Newtonsoft.Json, a third-party component used in SQL Server, that could be exploited to trigger a denial-of-service condition, as well as two privilege escalation vulnerabilities in Windows BitLocker (
CVE-2025-54911
, CVSS score: 7.3, and
CVE-2025-54912
, CVSS score: 7.8). Microsoft‚Äôs Hussein Alrubaye has been credited with discovering and reporting both the BitLocker flaws. The two defects add to four other vulnerabilities in the full-disk encryption feature (collectively called BitUnlocker) that were patched by Microsoft in July 2025 -
CVE-2025-48003
(CVSS score: 6.8) - BitLocker Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability via WinRE Apps Scheduled Operation
CVE-2025-48800
(CVSS score: 6.8) - BitLocker Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability by Targeting ReAgent.xml Parsing
CVE-2025-48804
(CVSS score: 6.8) - BitLocker Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability by Targeting Boot.sdi Parsing
CVE-2025-48818
(CVSS score: 6.8) - BitLocker Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability by Targeting Boot Configuration Data (BCD) Parsing
Successful exploitation of any of the above four flaws could allow an attacker with physical access to the target to bypass BitLocker protections and gain access to encrypted data. ‚ÄúTo further enhance the security of BitLocker, we recommend enabling TPM+PIN for pre-boot authentication,‚Äù Security Testing and Offensive Research at Microsoft (STORM) researchers Netanel Ben Simon and Alon Leviev
said
in a
report
last month.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis significantly reduces the BitLocker attack surfaces by limiting exposure to only the TPM.‚Äù
‚ÄúTo mitigate BitLocker downgrade attacks, we advise enabling the
REVISE mitigation
. This mechanism enforces secure versioning across critical boot components, preventing downgrades that could reintroduce known vulnerabilities in BitLocker and Secure Boot.‚Äù
The disclosure comes as Purple Team
detailed
a new
lateral movement technique
dubbed BitLockMove that involves the remote manipulation of BitLocker registry keys via Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to hijack specific COM objects of BitLocker. BitLockMove, developed by security researcher Fabian Mosch, works by initiating a remote connection to the target host through WMI and copying a malicious DLL to the target over SMB. In the next phase, the attacker writes a new registry key that specifies the DLL path, ultimately causing BitLocker to load the copied DLL by hijacking its COM objects.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe purpose of the BitLocker COM Hijacking is to execute code under the context of the interactive user on a target host,‚Äù Purple Team said. ‚ÄúIn the event that the interactive user has excessive privileges (i.e., domain administrator), this could also lead to domain escalation.‚Äù

<h2 id="apple-iphone-air-and-iphone-17-feature-a19-chips-with-spyware-resistant-memory-safety"><a id="article-10"></a>Apple iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Feature A19 Chips With Spyware-Resistant Memory Safety</h2>

<p>Apple on Tuesday revealed a new security feature called
Memory Integrity Enforcement
(MIE) that‚Äôs built into its newly introduced iPhone models, including iPhone 17 and iPhone Air. MIE, per the tech giant, offers ‚Äúalways-on memory safety protection‚Äù across critical attack surfaces such as the kernel and over 70 userland processes without sacrificing device performance by designing its A19 and A19 Pro chips keeping this aspect in mind. ‚ÄúMemory Integrity Enforcement is built on the robust foundation provided by our secure memory allocators, coupled with Enhanced Memory Tagging Extension (EMTE) in synchronous mode, and supported by extensive Tag Confidentiality Enforcement policies,‚Äù the company
noted
. The effort is an aim to improve
memory safety
and prevent bad actors, specifically those leveraging
mercenary spyware
, from weaponizing such flaws in the first place to break into devices as part of highly-targeted attacks.</p>

<p>The technology that underpins MIE is EMTE, an improved version of the Memory Tagging Extension (
MTE
) specification released by chipmaker Arm in 2019 to flag memory corruption bugs either synchronously or asynchronously. EMTE was released by Arm in 2022 following a collaboration with Apple. It‚Äôs worth noting that Google‚Äôs Pixel devices already have
support
for
MTE
as a developer option starting with Android 13. Similar
memory integrity features
have also been introduced by Microsoft in Windows 11.</p>

<p>How MIE blocks use-after-free access
‚ÄúThe ability of MTE to detect memory corruption exploitation at the first dangerous access is a significant improvement in diagnostic and potential security effectiveness,‚Äù Google Project Zero researcher Mark Brand
said
in October 2023, coinciding with the release of Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro. ‚ÄúThe availability of MTE on a production handset for the first time is a big step forward, and I think there‚Äôs real potential to use this technology to make 0-day harder.‚Äù
Apple said MIE transforms MTE from a ‚Äúhelpful debugging tool‚Äù into a groundbreaking new security feature, offering security protection against two common vulnerability classes ‚Äì buffer overflows and use-after-free bugs ‚Äì that could result in memory corruption. How MIE blocks buffer overflows
This essentially involves blocking out-of-bounds requests to access adjacent memory that has a different tag, and retagging memory as it gets reused for other purposes after it has been freed and reallocated by the system. As a result, requests to access retagged memory with an older tag (indicating use-after-free scenarios) also get blocked.</p>

<p>‚ÄúA key weakness of the original MTE specification is that access to non-tagged memory, such as global variables, is not checked by the hardware,‚Äù Apple explained. ‚ÄúThis means attackers don‚Äôt have to face as many defensive constraints when attempting to control core application configuration and state.‚Äù
‚ÄúWith Enhanced MTE, we instead specify that accessing non-tagged memory from a tagged memory region requires knowing that region‚Äôs tag, making it significantly harder for attackers to turn out-of-bounds bugs in dynamic tagged memory into a way to sidestep EMTE by directly modifying non-tagged allocations.‚Äù
Enabling MTE on Google Pixel
Cupertino said it has also developed what it calls Tag Confidentiality Enforcement (TCE) to secure the implementation of memory allocators against side-channel and
speculative execution attacks
like
TikTag
that MTE was found susceptible to last year, resulting in the leak of an MTE tag associated with an arbitrary memory address by exploiting the fact that tag checks generate cache state differences during speculative execution. ‚ÄúThe meticulous planning and implementation of Memory Integrity Enforcement made it possible to maintain synchronous tag checking for all the demanding workloads of our platforms, delivering groundbreaking security with minimal performance impact, while remaining completely invisible to users,‚Äù it added.

<h2 id="the-time-saving-guide-for-service-providers-automating-vciso-and-compliance-services"><a id="article-11"></a>The Time-Saving Guide for Service Providers: Automating vCISO and Compliance Services</h2>

<p>Introduction
Managed service providers (MSPs) and managed security service providers (MSSPs) are under increasing pressure to deliver strong cybersecurity outcomes in a landscape marked by rising threats and evolving compliance requirements. At the same time, clients want better protection without managing cybersecurity themselves. Service providers must balance these growing demands with the need to work efficiently, deliver consistent results, and scale their offerings. Yet, many service providers still rely on manual processes that slow down delivery, make it harder to maintain consistency across clients, and limit the time teams have to focus on more strategic initiatives.</p>

<p>Even experienced service providers can find themselves stretched thin as they try to meet rising client expectations while managing operational complexity. In this environment, automation offers an opportunity to work more effectively and deliver greater value. By streamlining repetitive tasks, improving consistency, and freeing up time and resources, automation helps providers expand their services, strengthen client relationships, and grow sustainably. We created
The Service Provider‚Äôs Guide to Automating Cybersecurity and Compliance Management
to help providers navigate the transition to automation.</p>

<p>Inside, you‚Äôll find a practical overview of current challenges, real-world examples, and guidance for identifying where automation can have the biggest impact. The Hidden Costs of Manual Work
Tasks like risk assessments, policy development, framework mapping, remediation planning, and executive reporting often require
13 to 15 hours of manual work each. This level of effort places mounting pressure on internal teams, extends project timelines, and delays client outcomes all of which can restrict growth. Over time, these inefficiencies quietly erode both profitability and service quality, making it harder to scale and compete effectively.</p>

<p>Key hidden costs include:
Time delays
that impact client satisfaction and slow down revenue cycles
Inconsistencies
across assessments and documentation, undermining trust
Talent inefficiency
as senior staff handle administrative work instead of strategic tasks
Missed revenue
opportunities due to limited capacity for upselling or onboarding new clients
Manual processes also create specific bottlenecks across five critical areas of service delivery:
Onboarding &amp; Assessments
‚Äì Repetitive, slow, and often inconsistent
Framework Mapping
‚Äì Labor-intensive and prone to errors
Remediation Management
‚Äì Hard to scale and standardize
Progress Reporting
‚Äì Time-consuming and lacks consistency and clarity
Service Customization
‚Äì Manual adjustments reduce repeatability
Automation is key to overcoming these barriers and unlocking scalable, high-margin service delivery. How Automation Can Help: 5 Key Use Cases
According to
The State of the Virtual CISO 2025 Report
,
vCISO providers using AI or automation report a 68% average reduction in cybersecurity and compliance workload over the past year. AI-powered technologies like Cynomi‚Äôs vCISO Platform automate and standardize vCISO workflows end-to-end, cutting manual efforts by up to 70%. Here are five key areas where automation can make a measurable impact:
Risk Assessments &amp; Onboarding:
Interactive, guided questionnaires and centralized data capture replace emails and interviews, cutting hours from onboarding timelines.</p>

<p>Policy Development:
Automated platforms generate client-specific policies mapped to frameworks like NIST and ISO. Compliance Tracking:
Tasks are automatically mapped to frameworks and updated as standards evolve, reducing oversight and error risk. Remediation Planning:
Tasks are prioritized and assigned automatically, allowing teams to track progress and outcomes in a centralized hub. Progress Reporting:
Client-branded, progress reports are generated in clicks, turning security activity into clear, business-focused insights without the usual delays.</p>

<p>Standardizing Service Delivery:
Automation streamlines core tasks like onboarding and compliance management, allowing providers to deliver consistent, high-quality services across clients without reinventing the wheel each time. The ROI of Automation
One of the most effective ways to measure automation‚Äôs value is through work hours saved. Tasks that once took over 13 hours can now be completed in just a few, freeing up nearly 10 hours per task to reinvest elsewhere. Multiply that across clients, and the impact on margins and capacity becomes substantial.</p>

<p>As Steve Bowman, Business Partner at Model Technology Solutions, noted, ‚ÄúWhen we started, it was four or five months before I‚Äôd have somebody doing an assessment on their own. Now it‚Äôs down to one month.‚Äù This dramatic improvement in ramp-up time underscores the transformative effect automation can have not only on day-to-day operations but also on long-term scalability. Here are some examples of time-consuming tasks and the time savings service providers achieve through automating them:
For more real-world insights into how much time automation can save across key cybersecurity functions, explore
The Service Provider‚Äôs Guide to Automating Cybersecurity and Compliance Management
. It includes practical examples and a straightforward formula to calculate ROI in both hours and dollars, so you can instantly see the measurable benefits automation can bring.</p>

<p>How to Implement Security and Compliance Automation
Here‚Äôs a practical roadmap for managed service providers aiming to integrate automation into their vCISO or compliance operations. Assess Current Processes:
Start by mapping your existing workflows, including onboarding, assessments, remediation planning, and reporting. Identify manual, repetitive tasks that slow you down or create inconsistencies. Define Automation Goals:
Clarify what you want to achieve through automation, such as reducing task time, increasing capacity, or improving service consistency.</p>

<p>Measurable goals help prioritize efforts and guide platform selection. Select a Deployment Model:
Explore three options: build your own tools, use a GRC platform for compliance, or adopt an all-in-one cybersecurity and compliance management platform like
Cynomi
. Each varies in complexity, scalability, and resource demands. Pilot Before Scaling:
Test your automation strategy with a single client or team to identify strengths, challenges, and integration needs before broader rollout.</p>

<p>Train Teams and Clients:
Provide tailored training and maintain open communication to ensure smoother adoption and build confidence in the new platform. Measure Impact and Optimize:
Track key metrics, such as time saved and reporting turnaround. Use these insights to refine processes and maximize ROI. Conclusion: Automation Is the New Differentiator
In today‚Äôs cybersecurity landscape, automation through AI has become a strategic necessity.</p>

<p>It empowers service providers to streamline operations, deliver consistent value, and scale without increasing overhead. Those who embrace it, position themselves to move faster, serve more clients, and elevate their role from technical support to trusted business advisor. Whether you‚Äôre just starting out or refining your current approach,
The Service Provider‚Äôs Guide to Automating Cybersecurity and Compliance Management
provides practical insights into current challenges, real-world examples, and guidance on what to automate, what to keep manual, and how to choose the right tools to scale effectively. Found this article interesting?</p>

<h2 id="watch-out-for-salty2fa-new-phishing-kit-targeting-us-and-eu-enterprises"><a id="article-12"></a>Watch Out for Salty2FA: New Phishing Kit Targeting US and EU Enterprises</h2>

<p>Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS) platforms keep evolving, giving attackers faster and cheaper ways to break into corporate accounts. Now, researchers at
ANY.RUN
has uncovered a new entrant:
Salty2FA
, a phishing kit designed to bypass multiple two-factor authentication methods and slip past traditional defenses. Already spotted in campaigns across the US and EU, Salty2FA puts enterprises at risk by targeting industries from finance to energy. Its multi-stage execution chain, evasive infrastructure, and ability to intercept credentials and 2FA codes make it one of the most dangerous PhaaS frameworks seen this year.</p>

<p>Why Salty2FA Raises the Stakes for Enterprises
Salty2FA‚Äôs ability to
bypass push, SMS, and voice-based 2FA
means stolen credentials can lead directly to account takeover. Already aimed at finance, energy, and telecom sectors, the kit turns common phishing emails into high-impact breaches. Who is Being Targeted? ANY.RUN analysts mapped Salty2FA campaigns and found activity spanning multiple regions and industries, with the
US and EU enterprises most heavily hit
.</p>

<p>Region
Key Targeted Industries
United States
Finance, healthcare, government, logistics, energy, IT consulting, education, construction
Europe (UK, Germany, Spain, Italy, Greece, Switzerland)
Telecom, chemicals, energy (including solar), industrial manufacturing, real estate, consulting
Worldwide / Other
Logistics, IT, metallurgy (India, Canada, France, LATAM)
When Did Salty2FA Start Hitting Enterprises? Based on data from the ANY.RUN Sandbox and TI, Salty2FA activity began gaining momentum in June 2025, with early traces possibly dating back to March‚ÄìApril. Confirmed campaigns have been active since late July and continue to this day, generating dozens of fresh analysis sessions daily. Real-World Case: How Salty2FA Exploits Enterprise Employees
One recent case analyzed by ANY.RUN shows just how convincing Salty2FA can be in practice.</p>

<p>An employee received an email with the subject line
‚ÄúExternal Review Request: 2025 Payment Correction‚Äù,
a lure designed to trigger urgency and bypass skepticism. When opened in the ANY.RUN sandbox, the attack chain unfolded step by step:

Malicious email with Salty2FA attack analyzed inside ANY.RUN sandbox
Stage 1: Email lure
The email contained a payment correction request disguised as a routine business message. Join 15K+ enterprises worldwide that cut investigation time and stop breaches faster with ANY.RUN
Get started now
Stage 2: Redirect and fake login
The link led to a Microsoft-branded login page, wrapped in Cloudflare checks to bypass automated filters. In the sandbox, ANY.RUN‚Äôs Automated Interactivity handled the verification automatically, exposing the flow without manual clicks and cutting investigation time for analysts.</p>

<p>Cloudflare verification completed automatically inside ANY.RUN sandbox
Stage 3: Credential theft
Employee details entered on the page were harvested and exfiltrated to attacker-controlled servers. Fake Microsoft page, ready to steal credentials from victims
Stage 4: 2FA bypass
If the account had multi-factor authentication enabled, the phishing page prompted for codes and could intercept push, SMS, or even voice call verification. By running the file in the sandbox, SOC teams could see the full execution chain in real time, from the first click to credential theft and 2FA interception. This level of visibility is critical, because static indicators like domains or hashes mutate daily, but behavioral patterns remain consistent.</p>

<p>Sandbox analysis gives faster confirmation of threats, reduced analyst workload, and better coverage against evolving PhaaS kits like Salty2FA. Stopping Salty2FA: What SOCs Should Do Next
Salty2FA shows how fast phishing-as-a-service is evolving and why static indicators alone won‚Äôt stop it. For SOCs and security leaders, protection means shifting focus to behaviors and response speed:
Rely on behavioral detection:
Track recurring patterns like domain structures and page logic rather than chasing constantly changing IOCs. Detonate suspicious emails in a sandbox:
Full-chain visibility reveals credential theft and 2FA interception attempts in real time.</p>

<p>Harden MFA policies:
Favor app-based or hardware tokens over SMS and voice, and use conditional access to flag risky logins. Train employees on financial lures:
Common hooks like ‚Äúpayment correction‚Äù or ‚Äúbilling statement‚Äù should always raise suspicion. Integrate sandbox results into your stack:
