<h2 id="russian-apt28-deploys-notdoor-outlook-backdoor-against-companies-in-nato-countries"><a id="article-1"></a>Russian APT28 Deploys “NotDoor” Outlook Backdoor Against Companies in NATO Countries</h2>

<p>The Russian state-sponsored hacking group tracked as
APT28
has been attributed to a new Microsoft Outlook backdoor called
NotDoor
in attacks targeting multiple companies from different sectors in NATO member countries. NotDoor “is a VBA macro for Outlook designed to monitor incoming emails for a specific trigger word,” S2 Grupo’s LAB52 threat intelligence team
said
. “When such an email is detected, it enables an attacker to exfiltrate data, upload files, and execute commands on the victim’s computer.”
The artifact gets its name from the use of the word “Nothing” within the source code, the Spanish cybersecurity company added. The activity highlights the abuse of Outlook as a stealthy communication, data exfiltration, and malware delivery channel.</p>

<p>The exact initial access vector used to deliver the malware is currently not known, but analysis shows that it’s deployed via Microsoft’s OneDrive executable (“onedrive.exe”) using a technique referred to as DLL side-loading. This leads to the execution of a malicious DLL (“SSPICLI.dll”), which then installs the VBA backdoor and disables macro security protections. Specifically, it runs Base64-encoded PowerShell commands to perform a series of actions that involve beaconing to an attacker-controlled webhook[.]site, setting up persistence through Registry modifications, enabling macro execution, and turning off Outlook-related dialogue messages to evade detection. NotDoor is designed as an obfuscated Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) project for Outlook that makes use of the
Application.MAPILogonComplete
and
Application.NewMailEx
events to run the payload every time Outlook is started or a new email arrives.</p>

<p>It then proceeds to create a folder at the path %TEMP%\Temp if it does not exist, using it as a staging folder to store TXT files created during the course of the operation and exfiltrate them to a Proton Mail address. It also parses incoming messages for a trigger string, such as “Daily Report,” causing it to extract the embedded commands to be executed. The malware supports four different commands -
cmd, to execute commands and return the standard output as an email attachment
cmdno, to execute commands
dwn, to exfiltrate files from the victim’s computer by sending them as email attachments
upl, to drop files to the victim’s computer
“Files exfiltrated by the malware are saved in the folder,” LAB52 said. “The file contents are encoded using the malware’s custom encryption, sent via email, and then deleted from the system.”
The disclosure comes as Beijing-based 360 Threat Intelligence Center detailed
Gamaredon
‘s (aka APT-C-53) evolving tradecraft, highlighting its use of Telegram-owned Telegraph as a dead-drop resolver to point to command-and-control (C2) infrastructure.</p>

<p>The attacks are also notable for the abuse of Microsoft Dev Tunnels (devtunnels.ms), a service that allows developers to securely expose local web services to the internet for testing and debugging purposes, as C2 domains for added stealth. “This technique provides twofold advantages: first, the original C2 server IP is completely masked by Microsoft’s relay nodes, blocking threat intelligence tracebacks based on IP reputation,” the cybersecurity company
said
. “Second, by exploiting the service’s ability to reset domain names on a minute-by-minute basis, the attackers can rapidly rotate infrastructure nodes, leveraging the trusted credentials and traffic scale of mainstream cloud services to maintain a nearly zero-exposure continuous threat operation.”
Attack chains entail the use of bogus
Cloudflare Workers domains
to distribute a Visual Basic Script like
PteroLNK
, which can propagate the infection to other machines by copying itself to connected USB drives, as well as download additional
payloads. “This attack chain demonstrates a high level of specialized design, employing four layers of obfuscation (registry persistence, dynamic compilation, path masquerading, cloud service abuse) to carry out a fully covert operation from initial implantation to data exfiltration,” 360 Threat Intelligence Center said.</p>

<h2 id="ghostredirector-hacks-65-windows-servers-using-rungan-backdoor-and-gamshen-iis-module"><a id="article-2"></a>GhostRedirector Hacks 65 Windows Servers Using Rungan Backdoor and Gamshen IIS Module</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have lifted the lid on a previously undocumented threat cluster dubbed
GhostRedirector
that has managed to compromise at least 65 Windows servers primarily located in Brazil, Thailand, and Vietnam. The attacks, per Slovak cybersecurity company ESET, led to the deployment of a passive C++ backdoor called Rungan and a native Internet Information Services (IIS) module codenamed Gamshen. The threat actor is believed to be active since at least August 2024. “While Rungan has the capability of executing commands on a compromised server, the purpose of Gamshen is to provide SEO fraud as-a-service, i.e., to manipulate search engine results, boosting the page ranking of a configured target website,” ESET researcher Fernando Tavella
said
in a report shared with The Hacker News.</p>

<p>“Even though Gamshen only modifies the response when the request comes from Googlebot – i.e., it does not serve malicious content or otherwise affect regular visitors of the websites – participation in the SEO fraud scheme can hurt the compromised host website’s reputation by associating it with shady SEO techniques and the boosted websites.”
Some of the other targets of the hacking group include Peru, the U.S., Canada, Finland, India, the Netherlands, the Philippines, and Singapore. The activity is also said to be indiscriminate, with entities in the education, healthcare, insurance, transportation, technology, and retail sectors singled out. Initial access to target networks is accomplished by exploiting a vulnerability, likely an SQL injection flaw, after which PowerShell is used to deliver additional tools hosted on a staging server (“868id[.]com”). “This conjecture is supported by our observation that most unauthorized PowerShell executions originated from the binary sqlserver.exe, which holds a stored procedure
xp_cmdshell
that can be used to execute commands on a machine,” ESET said.</p>

<p>Rungan is designed to await incoming requests from a URL matching a predefined pattern (i.e., “https://+:80/v1.0/8888/sys.html”), and then proceeds to parse and execute the commands embedded in them. It supports four different commands -
mkuser, to create a user on the server with the username and password provided
listfolder, to collect information from a provided path (unfinished)
addurl, to register new URLs that the backdoor can listen on
cmd, to run a command on the server using pipes and the
CreateProcessA
API
Written in C/C++, Gamshen is an example of an IIS malware family called “
Group 13
,” which can act both as a backdoor and conduct SEO fraud. It functions similar to IISerpent, another IIS-specific malware that was documented by ESET back in August 2021. IISerpent
, configured as a malicious extension for Microsoft’s web server software, allows it to intercept all HTTP requests made to the websites hosted by the compromised server, specifically those originating from search engine crawlers, and change the server’s HTTP responses with the goal of redirecting the search engines to a scam website of the attacker’s choosing.</p>

<p>“GhostRedirector attempts to manipulate the Google search ranking of a specific, third-party website by using manipulative, shady SEO techniques such as creating artificial backlinks from the legitimate, compromised website to the target website,” Tavella said. It’s currently not known where these backlinks redirect unsuspecting users to, but it’s believed that the SEO fraud scheme is being used to promote various gambling websites. Also dropped alongside Rungan and Gamshen are various other tools -
GoToHTTP to establish a remote connection that’s accessible from a web browser
BadPotato or EfsPotato for creating a privileged user in the Administrators group
Zunput to collect information about websites hosted on the IIS server and drop ASP, PHP, and JavaScript web shells
It’s assessed with medium confidence that GhostRedirector is a China-aligned threat actor based on the presence of hard-coded Chinese strings in the source code, a code-signing certificate issued to a Chinese company, Shenzhen Diyuan Technology Co., Ltd., to sign the privilege escalation artifacts, and the use of the password “huang” for one of the GhostRedirector-created users on the compromised server. That said, GhostRedirector is not the first China-linked threat actor to use malicious IIS modules for SEO fraud.</p>

<p>Over the past year, both Cisco Talos and Trend Micro have detailed a Chinese-speaking group known as
DragonRank
that has engaged in SEO manipulation via BadIIS malware. “Gamshen abuses the credibility of the websites hosted on the compromised server to promote a third-party, gambling website – potentially a paying client participating in an SEO fraud as-a-service scheme,” the company said. “GhostRedirector also demonstrates persistence and operational resilience by deploying multiple remote access tools on the compromised server, on top of creating rogue user accounts, all to maintain long-term access to the compromised infrastructure.”

<h2 id="cybercriminals-exploit-xs-grok-ai-to-bypass-ad-protections-and-spread-malware-to-millions"><a id="article-3"></a>Cybercriminals Exploit X’s Grok AI to Bypass Ad Protections and Spread Malware to Millions</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have flagged a new technique that cybercriminals have adopted to bypass social media platform X’s malvertising protections and propagate malicious links using its artificial intelligence (AI) assistant Grok. The findings were
highlighted
by Nati Tal, head of Guardio Labs, in a series of posts on X. The technique has been codenamed Grokking. The approach is designed to get around restrictions imposed by X in
Promoted Ads
that allow users to only include text, images, or videos, and subsequently amplify them to a broader audience, attracting hundreds of thousands of impressions through paid promotion.</p>

<p>To achieve this, malvertisers have been found to run video card-promoted posts with adult content as bait, with the spurious link hidden in the “From:” metadata field below the video player that apparently isn’t scanned by the social media platform. In the next step, the fraudsters tag Grok in replies to the post, asking something similar to “where is this video from?,” prompting the AI chatbot to visibly display the link in response. “Adding to that, it is now amplified in SEO and domain reputation - after all, it was echoed by Grok on a post with millions of impressions,” Tal said. “A malicious link that X explicitly prohibits in ads (and should have been blocked entirely!) suddenly appears in a post by the system-trusted Grok account, sitting under a viral promoted thread and spreading straight into millions of feeds and search results!”
Guardio said the links direct users to sketchy ad networks, sending them to malicious links that push
fake CAPTCHA scams
, information-stealing malware, and other suspicious content via direct link (aka
smartlink
) monetization.</p>

<p>The domains are assessed to be part of the same Traffic Distribution System (TDS), which is often used by
malicious ad tech vendors
to route traffic to harmful or deceptive content. The cybersecurity company told The Hacker News it has found hundreds of accounts engaging in this behavior over the past few days, with each of them posting hundreds or even thousands of similar posts. “They seem to be posting non-stop for several days until the account gets suspended for violating platform policies,” it added. “So there are definitely many of them and it looks very organized.”

<h2 id="simple-steps-for-attack-surface-reduction"><a id="article-4"></a>Simple Steps for Attack Surface Reduction</h2>

<p>Story teaser text: Cybersecurity leaders face mounting pressure to stop attacks before they start, and the best defense may come down to the settings you choose on day one. In this piece, Yuriy Tsibere explores how default policies like deny-by-default, MFA enforcement, and application Ringfencing ™ can eliminate entire categories of risk. From disabling Office macros to blocking outbound server traffic, these simple but strategic moves create a hardened environment that attackers can’t easily penetrate. Whether you’re securing endpoints or overseeing policy rollouts, adopting a security-by-default mindset can reduce complexity, shrink your attack surface, and help you stay ahead of evolving threats.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity has changed dramatically since the days of the “Love Bug” virus in 2001. What was once an annoyance is now a profit-driven criminal enterprise worth billions. This shift demands proactive defense strategies that don’t just respond to threats—they prevent them from ever reaching your network. CISOs, IT admins, and MSPs need solutions that block attacks by default
, not just detect them after the fact.</p>

<p>Industry frameworks like NIST, ISO, CIS, and HIPAA provide guidance, but they often lack the clear, actionable steps needed to implement effective security. For anyone starting a new security leadership role, the mission is clear: Stop as many attacks as possible, frustrate threat actors, and do it without alienating the IT team. That’s where a security-by-default mindset comes in—configuring systems to block risks out of the gate. As I’ve often said, the attackers only have to be right once.</p>

<p>We have to be right 100% of the time. Here’s how setting the right defaults can eliminate entire categories of risk. Require multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all remote accounts
Enabling MFA across all remote services—including SaaS platforms like Office 365 and G Suite, as well as domain registrars and remote access tools—is a foundational security default. Even if a password is compromised, MFA can prevent unauthorized access.</p>

<p>Try to avoid using text messages for MFA as it can be intercepted. While it may introduce some friction, the security benefits far outweigh the risk of data theft or financial loss. Deny-by-default
One of the most effective security measures nowadays is application whitelisting or allowlisting. This approach blocks everything by default and only allows known, approved software to run.</p>

<p>The result: Ransomware and other malicious applications are stopped before they can execute. It also blocks legitimate-but-unauthorized remote tools like AnyDesk or similar, which attackers often try to sneak in through social engineering. Users can still access what they need via a pre-approved store of safe applications, and visibility tools make it easy to track everything that runs—including portable apps. Quick wins through secure configuration
Small changes to default settings can close major security gaps on Windows and other platforms:
Turn off Office macros: It takes five minutes and blocks one of the most common attack vectors for ransomware.</p>

<p>Use password-protected screensavers: Auto-lock your screen after a short break to stop anyone from snooping around. Disable SMBv1: This old-school protocol is outdated and has been used in big attacks like WannaCry. Most systems don’t need it anymore. Turn off the Windows keylogger: It’s rarely useful and could be a security risk if left on.</p>

<p>Control network and application behavior for organizations
Remove local admin rights: Most malware doesn’t need admin access to run, but taking it away stops users from messing with security settings or even installing malicious software. Block unused ports and limit outbound traffic:
Shut down SMB and RDP ports unless absolutely necessary—and only allow trusted sources. Stop servers from reaching the internet unless they need to. This helps avoid attacks like SolarWinds.</p>

<p>Control application behaviors: Tools like ThreatLocker Ringfencing ™ can stop apps from doing sketchy things
—like Word launching PowerShell (yes, that’s a real attack method). Secure your VPN: If you don’t need it, turn it off. If you do, limit access to specific IPs and restrict what users can access. Strengthen data and web controls
Block USB drives by default: They’re a common way for malware to spread.</p>

<p>Only allow secure managed, encrypted ones if needed. Limit file access: Apps shouldn’t be able to poke around in user files unless they really need to. Filter out unapproved tools: Block random SaaS or cloud apps that haven’t been vetted. Let users request access if they need something.</p>

<p>Track file activity: Keep an eye on who’s doing what with files—both on devices and in the cloud. It’s key for spotting shady behavior. Go beyond defaults with monitoring and patching
Strong defaults are just the beginning. Ongoing vigilance is critical:
Regular patching: Most attacks use known bugs.</p>

<p>Keep everything updated—including portable apps. Automated threat detection: EDR tools are great, but if no one’s watching alerts 24/7, threats can slip through. MDR services can jump in fast, even after hours. Security by default isn’t just smart, it’s non-negotiable.</p>

<p>Blocking unknown apps, using strong authentication, locking down networks and app behavior can wipe out a ton of risk. Attackers only need one shot, but solid default settings keep your defenses ready all the time. The payoff? Fewer breaches, less hassle, and a stronger, more resilient setup.</p>

<h2 id="google-fined-379-million-by-french-regulator-for-cookie-consent-violations"><a id="article-5"></a>Google Fined $379 Million by French Regulator for Cookie Consent Violations</h2>

<p>The French data protection authority has
fined
Google and Chinese e-commerce giant Shein $379 million (€325 million) and $175 million (€150 million), respectively, for violating cookie rules. Both companies set advertising cookies on users’ browsers without securing their consent, the National Commission on Informatics and Liberty (CNIL) said. Shein has since
updated
its systems to comply with the regulation. Reuters
reported
that the retailer plans to appeal the decision.</p>

<p>“When creating a Google account, users were encouraged to choose cookies linked to the display of personalized advertisements, to the detriment of those linked to the display of generic advertisements and that users were not clearly informed that the deposit of cookies for advertising purposes was a condition to be able to access Google’s services,” the CNIL
noted
. The consent obtained in this manner is not valid and constitutes a violation of the French Data Protection Act (Article 82), it added. It’s worth noting that while this was the default behavior until October 2023, when the company added an option to refuse cookies, “the lack of informed consent still persisted.”
Google has also been called out for placing advertisements in the form of emails among other emails in the “Promotions” and “Social” tabs of Gmail, stating that the display of such ads required users’ explicit consent in accordance with the French Postal and Electronic Communications Code (CPCE). French telecommunications operator Orange was
fined €50 million
back in December 2024 for similarly displaying ads between actual email messages without users’ consent.</p>

<p>Google has been ordered to bring its systems into compliance within six months, or risk facing penalties of €100,000 per day. The development comes as a U.S. jury
found Google
to have violated users’ privacy by collecting their data even after they opted out of Web &amp; App Activity tracking. The decision, which awards $425 million in compensatory damages, is the culmination of a class action lawsuit filed against the company in July 2020.</p>

<p>In a
statement
shared with Reuters, the tech giant said the ruling “misunderstands how [their] products work,” adding the company’s privacy tools give users control over their data and emphasized that their choice to turn off personalization are honored. It also said it plans to appeal. In related privacy-related announcements, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said Disney has
agreed
to pay $10 million to settle allegations that it collected personal data from children watching YouTube videos without parental notification or consent, thus violating the U.S.</p>

<p>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA). The agency said Disney failed to properly label some videos that it uploaded to YouTube as “Made for Kids,” thus allowing it to gather data from children under 13 who watched that content and use it to serve targeted ads. In addition to the $10 million fine, the proposed settlement requires Disney to begin alerting parents before collecting personal data from children under age 13 and obtain their consent in accordance with COPPA. Disney is also required to start a program to ensure that videos it uploads to YouTube are properly designated as intended for kids.</p>

<p>Separately, the FTC is also taking action against a China-based robot toy maker, Apitor Technology, over allegedly permitting a third-party called
JPush
to collect children’s geolocation data without their knowledge and parental consent in violation of COPPA. “Apitor integrated a third-party software development kit called JPush into its [Android] app that allowed JPush’s developer to collect location data and use it for any purpose, including advertising,” FTC
said
. “After Android users download the Apitor app, it begins collecting and sharing users’ precise location data with JPush’s servers, unbeknownst to child users and their parents.”

<h2 id="cisa-flags-tp-link-router-flaws-cve-2023-50224-and-cve-2025-9377-as-actively-exploited"><a id="article-7"></a>CISA Flags TP-Link Router Flaws CVE-2023-50224 and CVE-2025-9377 as Actively Exploited</h2>

<p>The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Wednesday
added
two security flaws impacting TP-Link wireless routers to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (
KEV
) catalog, noting that there is evidence of them being exploited in the wild. The vulnerabilities in question are listed below -
CVE-2023-50224
(CVSS score: 6.5) - An authentication bypass by spoofing vulnerability within the httpd service of TP-Link TL-WR841N, which listens on TCP port 80 by default, leading to the disclosure of stored credentials in “/tmp/dropbear/dropbearpwd”
CVE-2025-9377
(CVSS score: 8.6) - An operating system command injection vulnerability in TP-Link Archer C7(EU) V2 and TL-WR841N/ND(MS) V9 that could lead to remote code execution
According to
information
listed on the company’s website, the following router models have reached end-of-life (EoL) status -
TL-WR841N (versions 10.0 and 11.0)
TL-WR841ND (version 10.0)
Archer C7 (versions 2.0 and 3.0)
However, TP-Link has released firmware updates for the two vulnerabilities as of November 2024 owing to malicious exploitation activity. “The affected products have reached their End-of-Service (EOS) and are no longer receiving active support, including security updates,” the company
said
.</p>

<p>“For enhanced protection, we recommend that customers upgrade to newer hardware to ensure optimal performance and security.”
There are no public reports explicitly referencing the exploitation of the aforementioned vulnerabilities, but TP-Link, in an advisory
updated
last week, linked in-the-wild activity to a botnet known as
Quad7
(aka CovertNetwork-1658), which has been leveraged by a China-linked threat actor codenamed
Storm-0940
to conduct highly evasive password spray attacks. In light of active exploitation, Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies are being urged to apply the necessary mitigations by September 24, 2025, to secure their networks. The development comes a day after CISA
placed
another high-severity security flaw impacting TP-Link TL-WA855RE Wi-Fi Ranger Extender products (CVE-2020-24363, CVSS score: 8.8) to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation. Found this article interesting?</p>

<h2 id="malicious-npm-packages-exploit-ethereum-smart-contracts-to-target-crypto-developers"><a id="article-8"></a>Malicious npm Packages Exploit Ethereum Smart Contracts to Target Crypto Developers</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have discovered two new malicious packages on the npm registry that make use of smart contracts for the Ethereum blockchain to carry out malicious actions on compromised systems, signaling the trend of threat actors constantly on the lookout for new ways to distribute malware and fly under the radar. “The two npm packages abused smart contracts to conceal malicious commands that installed downloader malware on compromised systems,” ReversingLabs researcher Lucija Valentić
said
in a report shared with The Hacker News. The packages, both uploaded to npm in July 2025 and no longer available for download, are listed below -
colortoolsv2
(7 downloads)
mimelib2
(1 download)
The software supply chain security firm said the libraries are part of a larger and sophisticated campaign impacting both npm and GitHub, tricking unsuspecting developers into downloading and running them. While the packages themselves make no effort to conceal their malicious functionality, ReversingLabs noted that the GitHub projects that imported these packages took pains to make them look credible.</p>

<p>As for the packages themselves, the nefarious behavior kicks in once either of them is used or included in some other project, causing it to fetch and run a next-stage payload from an attacker-controlled server. Although this is par for the course when it comes to malware downloaders, where it stands apart is the use of Ethereum smart contracts to stage the URLs hosting the payload – a technique reminiscent of
EtherHiding
. The shift underscores the new tactics that threat actors are adopting to evade detection. Further investigation into the packages has revealed that they are referenced in a network of GitHub repositories claiming to be a solana-trading-bot-v2 that leverages “real-time on-chain data to execute trades automatically, saving you time and effort.” The GitHub account associated with the repository is no longer available.</p>

<p>It’s assessed that these accounts are part of a distribution-as-service (DaaS) offering called
Stargazers Ghost Network
, which refers to a cluster of bogus GitHub accounts that are known to star, fork, watch, commit, and subscribe to malicious repositories to artificially inflate their popularity. Included among those commits are source code changes to import colortoolsv2. Some of the other repositories caught pushing the npm package are ethereum-mev-bot-v2, arbitrage-bot, and hyperliquid-trading-bot. The naming of these GitHub repositories suggests that the cryptocurrency developers and users are the primary target of the campaign, using a combination of social engineering and deception.</p>

<p>“It is critical for developers to assess each library they are considering implementing before deciding to include it in their development cycle,” Valentić said. “And that means pulling back the covers on both open source packages and their maintainers: looking beyond raw numbers of maintainers, commits and downloads to assess whether a given package – and the developers behind it – are what they present themselves as.”

<p>Threat actors are attempting to leverage a newly released artificial intelligence (AI) offensive security tool called HexStrike AI to exploit recently disclosed security flaws. HexStrike AI, according to its
website
, is pitched as an AI‑driven security platform to automate reconnaissance and vulnerability discovery with an aim to accelerate authorized red teaming operations, bug bounty hunting, and capture the flag (CTF) challenges. Per information
shared
on its GitHub repository, the open-source platform integrates with over 150 security tools to facilitate network reconnaissance, web application security testing, reverse engineering, and cloud security. It also supports dozens of specialized AI agents that are fine-tuned for vulnerability intelligence, exploit development, attack chain discovery, and error handling.</p>

<p>But according to a report from Check Point, threat actors are trying their hands on the tool to gain an adversarial advantage, attempting to weaponize the tool to exploit recently disclosed security vulnerabilities. “This marks a pivotal moment: a tool designed to strengthen defenses has been claimed to be rapidly repurposed into an engine for exploitation, crystallizing earlier concepts into a widely available platform driving real-world attacks,” the cybersecurity company
said
. Discussions on darknet cybercrime forums show that threat actors claim to have successfully exploited the three security flaws that Citrix
disclosed
last week using HexStrike AI, and, in some cases, even flag seemingly vulnerable NetScaler instances that are then offered to other criminals for sale. Check Point said the malicious use of such tools has major implications for cybersecurity, not only shrinking the window between public disclosure and mass exploitation, but also helping parallelize the automation of exploitation efforts.</p>

<p>What’s more, it cuts down the human effort and allows for automatically retrying failed exploitation attempts until they become successful, which the cybersecurity company said increases the “overall exploitation yield.”
“The immediate priority is clear: patch and harden affected systems,” it added. “Hexstrike AI represents a broader paradigm shift, where AI orchestration will increasingly be used to weaponize vulnerabilities quickly and at scale.”
HexStrike AI isn’t the first red-teaming and defender-focused tool to be missed by cybercriminals, and it certainly won’t be the last. Just last week, Sophos
revealed
how threat actors weaponized an open-source endpoint monitoring and digital forensic tool called Velociraptor in an attack designed to drop additional payloads. The disclosure comes as two researchers from Alias Robotics and Oracle Corporation said in a newly published study that AI-powered cybersecurity agents like PentestGPT carry heightened prompt injection risks, effectively turning security tools into cyber weapons via hidden instructions.</p>

<p>“The hunter becomes the hunted, the security tool becomes an attack vector, and what started as a penetration test ends with the attacker gaining shell access to the tester’s infrastructure,” researchers Víctor Mayoral-Vilches and Per Mannermaa Rynning
said
. “Current LLM-based security agents are fundamentally unsafe for deployment in adversarial environments without comprehensive defensive measures.”

<h2 id="detecting-data-leaks-before-disaster"><a id="article-10"></a>Detecting Data Leaks Before Disaster</h2>

<p>In January 2025, cybersecurity experts at Wiz Research found that Chinese AI specialist DeepSeek had suffered a data leak, putting more than 1 million sensitive log streams at risk. According to the Wiz Research team, they identified a publicly accessible ClickHouse database belonging to DeepSeek. This allowed “full control over database operations, including the ability to access internal data”, Wiz Research stated, with more than a million lines of log streams involved, containing chat history, secret keys and more. Wiz immediately reported the issue to DeepSeek, which quickly secured the exposure.</p>

<p>Still, the incident underscored the danger of data leakage. Intentional or unintentional? Data leakage is a broad concept, covering a range of scenarios. As IBM notes, the term in general refers to a scenario where
“sensitive information is unintentionally exposed to unauthorized parties”
.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>It could be intentional or unintentional. On the intentional side, for instance, hackers could use phishing or social engineering techniques to manipulate an organization’s employees into exposing their personal data. There’s even the risk of an insider threats</dt>
  <dd>for instance, a worker with a grudge who seeks to compromise systems, perhaps for financial benefit or as part of some quest for revenge. But unintentional leakage is just as big a concern.</dd>
</dl>

<p>This could be a case of simple human error: sending an email to the wrong person or
providing too much information
to a third party for example. There are a wide range of common vectors – we’ll run through just a few. Misconfigured cloud storage
Cloud misconfigurations can be a common cause of data leakage. The Cloud Security Alliance highlights the danger from simple mistakes
, like leaving default passwords in place or failing to properly configure access controls.</p>

<p>Endpoint vulnerabilities
Data processed through hardware like unencrypted laptops or stored in devices such as USBs
can be a key vulnerability for leakage; it’s important that employees are aware of – and follow – organizational security policies to mitigate this risk. Emails and messaging
There’s a real danger that data can be intercepted: this could come from a simple error (sending a sensitive attachment to the wrong address) or through a deliberate attack. Robust encryption is essential to ensure it stays in the right hands. Shadow IT
Employees often use their own IT as part of their daily working lives (such as external cloud technologies), including for data storage.</p>

<p>While this isn’t generally malicious, it can make risk management more difficult, notes the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), “
because you won’t have a full understanding of what you need to protect and what you value most
.”
Financial and legal problems
There are several common drivers of data leakage, ranging from weak access controls to a lack of data-classification policies, insufficient monitoring, and inadequate employee training. But no matter the specific cause, the consequences can be devastating. For example, regulatory authorities around the world now enforce strict data protection policies, which can result in huge fines for organizations that fail to comply; this includes the EU’s General Daa Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). There is also the broader risk of losing intellectual property (IP) or other sensitive company information.</p>

<p>Crimes like credit card fraud could stem from a leak, while public companies could even see a fall in their share price. Perhaps most importantly, failing to protect employee and customer data could have a devastating impact on an organization’s reputation, with long-term negative implications for the business. Building your defenses
So how can organizations protect themselves, their employees and their customers from the dangers of data leakage? Here are some key approaches:
Enforce least-privilege access:
By granting users access only to the data they need to perform their job,
the ‘blast radius’ of a breach or leakage will be significantly reduced
.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Pursue data loss prevention (DLP)</dt>
  <dd>This is a wide-ranging solution, combining technologies like AI and antivirus software with techniques and actions focused on people and processes,
all with the aim of identifying and preventing data-connected harm
. Classify sensitive data:
Protection begins with knowledge. Develop a thorough understanding of your riskiest data to ensure you know where to prioritize your security implementation. Audits:
Through both
external audit checks and a comprehensive internal audit program
, organizations can increase their chances of identifying potential vulnerabilities.</dd>
  <dt>Training</dt>
  <dd>Of course, no technical solution or operational enhancement can succeed without full employee engagement and understanding. Adequate training will ensure your staff and other stakeholders are up to speed, while engagement may even produce new insights into vulnerabilities and mitigation techniques. CompassDRP: Detect leaked data
As your digital attack surface grows, so does the risk of data leakage. Outpost24’s CompassDRP helps organizations manage this expanding threat environment, with a
key module focused on data leakage
.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The feature has
crucial applications for many businesses
. These include:
Detect potentially leaked documents or confidential data:
Users often rely on unauthorized or misconfigured applications to share documents and sometimes confidential data with customers or colleagues. The Data Leakage feature is designed to detect such cases across numerous sources, including document repositories. Detect potentially leaked source code:
Such leakages could reveal internal information to an attacker, including IP or even the authentication tokens in the code.</p>

<p>The Data Leakage feature searches code repositories to detect these leaks. Organizations of all sizes deal with growing volumes of data today. This is a huge advantage, helping gather insights into your business and your customer base. However, it also poses risks, as we have seen.</p>

<p>By embracing technological innovation and operational enhancements, you can help ensure your organization realizes the many benefits of this information without succumbing to the dangers and costly consequences of data leakage. Book a CompassDRP live demo

<h2 id="android-security-alert-google-patches-120-flaws-including-two-zero-days-under-attack"><a id="article-11"></a>Android Security Alert: Google Patches 120 Flaws, Including Two Zero-Days Under Attack</h2>

<p>Google has
shipped
security updates to address 120 security flaws in its Android operating system as part of its monthly fixes for September 2025, including two issues that it said have been exploited in targeted attacks. The vulnerabilities are listed below -
CVE-2025-38352
(CVSS score: 7.4) - A privilege escalation flaw in the Linux Kernel component
CVE-2025-48543
(CVSS score: N/A) - A privilege escalation flaw in the Android Runtime component
Google said both vulnerabilities could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. It also noted that no user interaction is required for exploitation. The tech giant did not reveal how the issues have been weaponized in real-world attacks and if they are being put to use in tandem, but
acknowledged
there are indications of “limited, targeted exploitation.”
Benoît Sevens of Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) has been credited with discovering and reporting the upstream Linux Kernel flaw, indicating that it may have been abused as part of targeted spyware attacks.</p>

<p>Also patched by Google are several remote code execution, privilege escalation, information disclosure, and denial-of-service vulnerabilities impacting Framework and System components. Google has released two security patch levels, 2025-09-01 and 2025-09-05, so as to give flexibility to Android partners to address a portion of vulnerabilities that are similar across all Android devices more quickly. “Android partners are encouraged to fix all issues in this bulletin and use the latest security patch level,” Google said. Last month, the tech giant Google
released
security updates to resolve two Qualcomm vulnerabilities – CVE-2025-21479 (CVSS score: 8.6) and CVE-2025-27038 (CVSS score: 7.5) – that were flagged by the chipmaker as actively exploited in the wild.</p>

<h2 id="iranian-hackers-exploit-100-embassy-email-accounts-in-global-phishing-targeting-diplomats"><a id="article-12"></a>Iranian Hackers Exploit 100+ Embassy Email Accounts in Global Phishing Targeting Diplomats</h2>

<p>An Iran-nexus group has been linked to a “coordinated” and “multi-wave” spear-phishing campaign targeting the embassies and consulates in Europe and other regions across the world. The activity has been attributed by Israeli cybersecurity company Dream to Iranian-aligned operators connected to broader offensive cyber activity undertaken by a group known as
Homeland Justice
. “Emails were sent to multiple government recipients worldwide, disguising legitimate diplomatic communication,” the company
said
. “Evidence points toward a broader regional espionage effort aimed at diplomatic and governmental entities during a time of heightened geopolitical tension.”
The attack chains involve the use of spear-phishing emails with themes related to geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel to send a malicious Microsoft Word that, when opened, urges recipients to “Enable Content” in order to execute an embedded Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro, which is responsible for deploying the malware payload.</p>

<p>The email messages, per Dream, were sent to embassies, consulates, and international organizations across the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Americas, suggesting that the activity cast a wide phishing net. European embassies and African organizations are said to have been the most heavily targeted. The digital missives were sent from 104 unique compromised addresses belonging to officials and pseudo-government entities to give them an extra layer of credibility. At least some of the emails originated from a hacked mailbox belonging to the Oman Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Paris (*@fm.gov.om).</p>

<p>“The lure content consistently referenced urgent MFA communications, conveyed authority, and exploited the common practice of enabling macros to access content, which are the hallmarks of a well-planned espionage operation that deliberately masked attribution,” Dream said. The end goal of the attacks is to deploy using the VBA macro an executable that can establish persistence, contact a command-and-control (C2) server, and harvest system information. Cybersecurity company ClearSky, which also detailed some aspects of the campaign late last month, said the phishing emails were sent to multiple ministries of foreign affairs. “Similar obfuscation techniques were used by Iranian threat actors in 2023 when they targeted
Mojahedin-e-Khalq
in Albania,” it
said
in a post on X.</p>

<p>“We assess with moderate confidence that this activity is linked to the same Iranian threat actors.”

<h2 id="ai-driven-trends-in-endpoint-security-what-the-2025-gartner-magic-quadrant-reveals"><a id="article-13"></a>AI-Driven Trends in Endpoint Security: What the 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ Reveals</h2>

<p>Cyber threats and attacks like ransomware continue to increase in volume and complexity with the endpoint typically being the most sought after and valued target. With the rapid expansion and adoption of AI, it is more critical than ever to ensure the endpoint is adequately secured by a platform capable of not just keeping pace, but staying ahead of an ever-evolving threat landscape. SentinelOne’s steadfast commitment to delivering AI-powered cybersecurity enables global customers and partners to achieve resiliency and reduce risk with real-time, autonomous protection across the entire enterprise — all from a single agent and console with a robust, rigorously tested platform that keeps the customer in control. Cybersecurity today isn’t just about detection—it’s about operational continuity under pressure.</p>

<p>For example, endpoint solutions must account for encrypted traffic inspection, policy enforcement during identity compromise, and fast containment across distributed environments. These capabilities are especially critical in industries like healthcare or finance, where seconds can mean regulatory penalties or breached patient records. Gartner recently named SentinelOne a Leader in the
2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant for Endpoint Protection Platforms
for the fifth consecutive year. This recognition builds on the Singularity Platform’s momentum in innovation as the first solution with an AI analyst and the first unified platform delivering EDR, CNAPP, Hyperautomation, and SIEM to be FedRAMP High (the highest level of U.S.</p>

<p>federal cloud security authorization) Authorized. SentinelOne provides protection for organizations of all sizes—from small businesses to global governments and enterprises—meeting their unique needs in the face of an increasingly complex cyber landscape. The Singularity Platform secures organizations across any device, any OS, and any cloud, providing industry-leading signal-to-noise so SOC teams can focus on responding as quickly as possible. With advanced XDR, AI SIEM, and CNAPP capabilities, a lightweight agent, and responsible architecture, SentinelOne offers a solution designed for both security and operational resiliency.</p>

<p>Organizations using
Singularity Endpoint and Purple AI detect threats 63% faster, reduce MTTR by 55%
, and lower the likelihood of a security incident by 60%. Customers have reported a 338% ROI over three years, maximizing the value of their security investments while strengthening their endpoint security. For example, a healthcare provider using SentinelOne reported cutting incident response time by over 50% during a phishing-induced ransomware outbreak, thanks to automated rollback and unified visibility across cloud workloads and endpoints. Many teams searching for EDR or XDR platforms are trying to answer: “Will this reduce alert fatigue?” or “Can it integrate with my SIEM or SOAR stack without more overhead?” This is where automation must go beyond buzzwords—reducing manual triage, stitching disconnected signals, and working with existing tools instead of replacing them.</p>

<p>SentinelOne has set the standard in modern endpoint protection since entering the market more than a decade ago, disrupting both traditional antivirus and early next-gen AV approaches. Unlike signature-based protection and cloud-dependent defenses, the platform pioneered the use of static and behavioral AI and machine learning to detect even novel techniques, solve for both online and air-gapped environments, and automate response. These innovations differentiate SentinelOne from traditional AV and even next-gen EDR solutions, offering deeper automation and on-device intelligence compared to competitors that rely heavily on cloud lookups or manual workflows. This innovation, architecture, and design philosophy continues to evolve through Purple AI, advanced behavioral detection models, automated remediation and rollback, XDR capabilities, and more.</p>

<p>The security platform now offers solutions spanning Identity, Cloud, AI SIEM, Hyperautomation, expert-managed detection and response, and a range of threat services. Accelerating the SOC and staying ahead of attacks in the age of AI requires platforms that harness innovation in AI and automation to radically improve detection, triage, and response. SentinelOne’s platform has long embedded AI and automation as a foundational element. The company continues to develop accessible, compliant AI and automation to transform the SOC.</p>

<p>Behavioral AI and the Future of Cyber Threat Detection
Over the last decade, SentinelOne has advanced behavioral AI detections, automated remediation, and introduced agentic AI for security. Rather than merely assisting analysts, agentic AI—defined as a class of autonomous AI systems capable of initiating and executing security actions without human prompting—autonomously takes action, handles routine tasks, and accelerates decision making while keeping the human operator in control. Purple AI, the platform’s AI security analyst
, translates natural language questions into powerful threat hunting queries, suggests follow-up questions, recommends next steps, and generates reports and email summaries to accelerate remediation. Built on the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF), a vendor-agnostic standard for unifying data models, Purple AI ensures unified visibility across all security data, enabling fast, precise threat detection.</p>

<p>Figure 2: A natural language query using Purple AI to hunt for Privilege Escalation activity
This capability is integrated into Singularity Complete, SentinelOne’s EDR solution, positioning Purple AI as a transformative force in SOC operations. By combining human insight with AI-level reasoning and automation, it enables faster, more accurate triage, investigation, threat management, and response. How Endpoint Security Has Evolved in the Age of AI
Product innovation remains central to SentinelOne’s strategy, driven by customer feedback, cost and time savings, and deep integration of AI and automation. Detects suspicious and malicious patterns in real time using behavioral and static AI models across servers, workstations, and workloads
