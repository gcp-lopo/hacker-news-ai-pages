<h2 id="malicious-vsx-extension-sleepyduck-uses-ethereum-to-keep-its-command-server-alive"><a id="article-1"></a>Malicious VSX Extension “SleepyDuck” Uses Ethereum to Keep Its Command Server Alive</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have flagged a new malicious extension in the Open VSX registry that harbors a remote access trojan called
SleepyDuck
. According to Secure Annex’s John Tuckner, the extension in question, juan-bianco.solidity-vlang (version 0.0.7), was first published on October 31, 2025, as a completely benign library that was subsequently updated to version 0.0.8 on November 1 to include new malicious capabilities after reaching 14,000 downloads. “The malware includes sandbox evasion techniques and utilizes an Ethereum contract to update its command and control address in case the original address is taken down,” Tuckner
added
. Campaigns
distributing
rogue extensions targeting Solidity developers have been repeatedly detected across both the Visual Studio Extension Marketplace and Open VSX.</p>

<p>In July 2025, Kaspersky
disclosed
that a Russian developer lost $500,000 in cryptocurrency assets after installing one such extension through Cursor. In the latest instance detected by the enterprise extension security firm, the malware is triggered when a new code editor window is opened or a .sol file is selected. Specifically, it’s configured to find the fastest Ethereum Remote Procedure Call (RPC) provider to connect to in order to obtain access to the blockchain, initialize contact with a remote server at “sleepyduck[.]xyz” (hence the name) via the contract address “
0xDAfb81732db454DA238e9cFC9A9Fe5fb8e34c465
,” and kicks off a polling loop that checks for new commands to be executed on the host every 30 seconds. It’s also capable of gathering system information, such as hostname, username, MAC address, and timezone, and exfiltrating the details to the server.</p>

<p>In the event the domain is seized or taken down, the malware has built-in fallback controls to reach out to a predefined list of Ethereum RPC addresses to extract the contract information that can hold the server details. What’s more, the extension is equipped to reach a new configuration from the contract address to set a new server, as well as execute an emergency command to all endpoints in the event that something unexpected occurs. The contract was created on October 31, 2025, with the
threat actor
updating the server details from “localhost:8080” to “sleepyduck[.]xyz” over the course of four transactions. It’s not clear if the download counts were artificially inflated by the threat actors to boost the relevance of the extension in search results – a tactic often
adopted
to increase the popularity so as to trick unsuspecting developers into installing a malicious library.</p>

<p>The development comes as the company also disclosed details of another set of five extensions, this time published to the VS Code Extension Marketplace by a user named “developmentinc,” including a Pokémon-themed library that downloads a batch script miner from an external server (“mock1[.]su:443”) as soon as it’s installed or enabled, and runs the miner using “cmd.exe.”
The script file, besides relaunching itself with administrator privileges using PowerShell and configuring Microsoft Defender Antivirus exclusions by adding every drive letter from C: through Z:, downloads a Monero mining executable from “mock1[.]su” and runs it. The extensions uploaded by the threat actor, now no longer available for download, are listed below -
developmentinc.cfx-lua-vs
developmentinc.pokemon
developmentinc.torizon-vs
developmentinc.minecraftsnippets
developmentinc.kombai-vs
Users are advised to exercise caution when it comes to downloading extensions, and make sure that they are from trusted publishers. Microsoft, for its part, announced back in June that it’s instituting periodic marketplace-wide scans to protect users against malware. Every removed extension from the official marketplace can be viewed from the
RemovedPackages page

<h2 id="cybercriminals-exploit-remote-monitoring-tools-to-infiltrate-logistics-and-freight-networks"><a id="article-2"></a>Cybercriminals Exploit Remote Monitoring Tools to Infiltrate Logistics and Freight Networks</h2>

<p>Bad actors are increasingly training their sights on trucking and logistics companies with an aim to infect them with remote monitoring and management (RMM) software for financial gain and ultimately steal cargo freight. The threat cluster, believed to be active since at least June 2025 according to Proofpoint, is said to be collaborating with organized crime groups to break into entities in the surface transportation industry with the end goal of plundering physical goods. The most targeted commodities of the cyber-enabled heists are food and beverage products. “The stolen cargo most likely is sold online or shipped overseas,” researchers Ole Villadsen and Selena Larson
said
in a report shared with The Hacker News.</p>

<p>“In the observed campaigns, threat actors aim to infiltrate companies and use their fraudulent access to bid on real shipments of goods to ultimately steal them.”
The campaigns share similarities with a previous set of attacks
disclosed
in September 2024 that involved targeting transportation and logistics companies in North America with information stealers and remote access trojans (RATs) such as Lumma Stealer, StealC, or NetSupport RAT. However, there is no evidence to suggest that they are the work of the same threat actor. In the current intrusion wave detected by Proofpoint, the unknown attackers have leveraged multiple methods, including compromised email accounts to hijack existing conversations, targeting asset-based carriers, freight brokerage firms, and integrated supply chain providers with spear-phishing emails, and posting fraudulent freight listings using hacked accounts on load boards. “The actor posts fraudulent freight listings using compromised accounts on load boards and then sends emails containing malicious URLs to carriers who inquire about the loads,” it said.</p>

<p>“This tactic exploits the trust and urgency inherent in freight negotiations.”
Needless to say, the malicious URLs embedded within the messages lead to booby-trapped MSI installers or executables that deploy legitimate RMM tools like ScreenConnect, SimpleHelp, PDQ Connect, Fleetdeck, N-able, and LogMeIn Resolve. In select instances, several of these programs are used together, with PDQ Connect being used to drop and install ScreenConnect and SimpleHelp. Once remote access is obtained, the attackers move to conduct system and network reconnaissance, followed by dropping credential harvesting tools such as
WebBrowserPassView
to capture additional credentials and burrow deeper into the corporate network. In at least one case, the threat actor is believed to have weaponized the access to delete existing bookings and block dispatcher notifications, and then added their own device to the dispatcher’s phone extension, booked loads under the compromised carrier’s name, and coordinated the transport.</p>

<p>The use of RMM software offers several advantages. First, it obviates the need for threat actors to devise bespoke malware. Second, it also allows them to fly under the radar, owing to the prevalence of such tools in enterprise environments, and are typically not flagged as malicious by security solutions. “It’s fairly easy for threat actors to create and distribute attacker-owned remote monitoring tools, and because they are often used as legitimate pieces of software, end users might be less suspicious of installing RMMs than other remote access trojans,” Proofpoint
noted
back in March 2025.</p>

<p>“Additionally, such tooling may evade anti-virus or network detection because the installers are often signed, legitimate payloads distributed maliciously.”

TEE.Fail Side-Channel Attack Extracts Secrets from Intel and AMD DDR5 Secure Enclaves
— A low-cost physical side-channel attack has been found to break the confidentiality and security guarantees offered by modern Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) from Intel and AMD, enabling full extraction of cryptographic keys and subversion of secure attestation mechanisms. The attack, codenamed TEE.fail, exploits deterministic encryption and DDR5 bus interposition to successfully bypass protections in Intel’s SGX and TDX, as well as AMD’s SEV-SNP, by eavesdropping on memory transactions using a homemade logic analyzer setup built for under $1,000.</p>

<p>That having said, the attack requires physical access to the target as well as root-level privileges for Kernel driver modification. Russian Hackers Target Ukraine With Stealth Tactics
— Suspected Russian hackers breached Ukrainian networks this summer using ordinary administrative tools to steal data and remain undetected, researchers have found. According to a report by Broadcom-owned Symantec and Carbon Black, the attackers targeted a large Ukrainian business services company and a local government agency in two separate incidents earlier this year. What makes these attacks notable is that the hackers deployed little custom malware and instead relied heavily on living-off-the-land tactics, i.e., using legitimate software already present in the victims’ networks, to carry out their malicious actions.</p>

<p>The targeted organizations were not named, and it remains unclear what information, if any, was stolen. N. Korea Targets Web3 Sector with GhostCall and GhostHire
— The North Korea-affiliated threat actor BlueNoroff, also known under aliases APT38 and TA444, has resurfaced with two new campaigns dubbed GhostCall and GhostHire, targeting executives, Web3 developers, and blockchain professionals. The campaigns rely on social engineering via platforms like Telegram and LinkedIn to send fake meeting invites and initiate multi-stage malware chains to compromise Windows, Linux, and macOS hosts.</p>

<p>GhostCall marks a major leap in operational stealth compared to earlier BlueNoroff operations, with the attackers relying on multiple layers of staging to sidestep detection. The GhostHire operation takes a different approach, targeting Web3 developers through fake job offers and recruitment tests. BlueNoroff is a financially motivated sub-cluster of the Lazarus Group, North Korea’s state-sponsored cyber unit linked to the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), and is believed to operate the long-running SnatchCrypto campaign. GhostCall and GhostHire are assessed to be the latest extensions of this campaign.</p>

<p>The threat actor’s strategy is said to have evolved beyond cryptocurrency and browser credential theft to comprehensive data acquisition across a range of assets. “This harvested data is exploited not only against the initial target but also to facilitate subsequent attacks, enabling the actor to execute supply chain attacks and leverage established trust relationships to impact a broader range of users,” Kaspersky said. New Android Banking Malware Herodotus Mimics Human Behavior
— Researchers have discovered a new Android banking malware called Herodotus that evades detection by mimicking human behavior when remotely controlling infected devices. The malware is advertised by a little-known hacker who goes by the name K1R0.</p>

<p>Herodotus works like many modern Android banking trojans. Operators distribute it through SMS messages that trick users into downloading a malicious app. Once installed, the malware waits for a targeted application to be opened and then overlays a fake screen that mimics the real banking or payment interface to steal credentials. It also intercepts incoming SMS messages to capture one-time passcodes and exploits Android’s accessibility features to read what’s displayed on the device screen.</p>

<p>What makes Herodotus unusual, ThreatFabric said, is that it tries to “humanize” the actions attackers undertake during remote control. Instead of pasting stolen details into form fields all at once — a behavior that can easily be flagged as automated — the malware types each character separately with random pauses of about 0.3 to 3 seconds between keystrokes, imitating how a real person would type. Qilin Ransomware Uses Linux Encryptors in Windows Attacks
— The Qilin ransomware actors have been observed leveraging the Windows Subsystem for Linux (
WSL
) to launch Linux encryptors in Windows in an attempt to evade detection. Qilin, which emerged in mid-2022, has attacked more than 700 victims across 62 countries this year.</p>

<p>The sustained rate of victims claimed on its data leak site underscores Qilin’s position as one of the most active and pernicious ransomware operations worldwide. In new attacks spotted by Trend Micro, Qilin affiliates have been seen using WinSCP to transfer the Linux ELF encryptor to compromised devices, which is then launched through the Splashtop remote management software. This is accomplished by enabling or installing WSL on the host, allowing them to natively run Linux binaries on Windows without the need for a virtual machine. ‎️‍🔥 Trending CVEs

Canada Warns of Hacktivist Attacks Targeting Critical Infra
— The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security has issued an alert warning of attacks mounted by hacktivists targeting internet-exposed industrial control systems (ICS). “One incident affected a water facility, tampering with water pressure values and resulting in degraded service for its community,” the Cyber Centre
said
. “Another involved a Canadian oil and gas company, where an Automated Tank Gauge (ATG) was manipulated, triggering false alarms.</p>

<p>A third one involved a grain drying silo on a Canadian farm, where temperature and humidity levels were manipulated, resulting in potentially unsafe conditions if not caught on time.” Organizations are being recommended to ensure all services are properly inventoried, documented, and protected. Kinsing Exploits Apache ActiveMQ Flaw
— The threat actor known as
Kinsing
is
exploiting
CVE-2023-46604
, a known flaw in Apache ActiveMQ, to conduct cryptojacking attacks on both Linux and Windows systems. The latest set of attacks, observed by AhnLab, is notable for the deployment of a .NET backdoor called Sharpire, along with XMRig and Stager. “
Sharpire
is a .NET backdoor that supports PowerShell Empire,” the South Korean cybersecurity company said.</p>

<p>“During the process of taking control of the infected system, the threat actor uses CobaltStrike, Meterpreter, and PowerShell Empire together.” It’s worth noting that Kinsing was spotted
exploiting the same flaw
following its public disclosure in 2023. 2 Flaws in 8 Confidential Computing Systems
— Two security flaws (CVE-2025-59054 and CVE-2025-58356) have been disclosed in eight different confidential computing systems (Oasis Protocol, Phala Network, Flashbots TDX, Fortanix Salmiac, Edgeless Constellation, Edgeless Contrast, and Cosmian VM) that use Linux Unified Key Setup version 2 (LUKS2) for disk encryption. A partial mitigation has been introduced in
cryptsetup
version 2.8.1. “Using these vulnerabilities, a malicious actor with access to storage disks can extract all confidential data stored on that disk and can modify the contents of the disk arbitrarily,” Trail of Bits researcher Tjaden Hess
said
.</p>

<p>“The vulnerabilities are caused by malleable metadata headers that allow an attacker to trick a trusted execution environment guest into encrypting secret data with a null cipher.” That said, exploitation of this issue requires write access to encrypted disks. There is no evidence that the vulnerabilities were exploited in the wild. Hackers Abuse LinkedIn to Target Finance Executives
— Hackers are abusing LinkedIn to target finance executives with direct-message phishing attacks that impersonate executive board invitations with an aim to steal their Microsoft credentials. The messages contain a malicious URL, clicking which triggers a redirect chain that leads victims to a fake landing page instructing them to sign in with their Microsoft account credentials to view a document.</p>

<p>The phishing page also implements bot protection like Cloudflare Turnstile to block automated scanners. “Sending phishing lures via social media apps like LinkedIn is a great way to reach employees in a place that they expect to be contacted by people outside of their organization,” Push Security
said
. “By evading the traditional phishing control point altogether (email) attackers significantly reduce the risk of interception.”
WhatsApp Adds Support for Passkey-Encrypted Backups
— WhatsApp has announced a new way to access encrypted backups with passkey support. “Passkeys will allow you to use your fingerprint, face, or screen lock code to encrypt your chat backups instead of having to memorize a password or a cumbersome 64-digit encryption key,” WhatsApp
said
.</p>

<p>“Now, with just a tap or a glance, the same security that protects your personal chats and calls on WhatsApp is applied to your chat backups so they are always safe, accessible, and private.” The change is expected to be rolled out gradually over the coming weeks and months. Passkeys are a passwordless authentication method based on the FIDO industry standard. They are designed to replace passwords with cryptographic keys stored on the user’s device and secured by biometric or device-lock methods. WhatsApp launched support for passkeys on Android in October 2023 and for iOS in April 2024.</p>

<p>12 Malicious VS Code Extensions Flagged
— Cybersecurity researchers have flagged a set of 12 malicious components in the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension marketplace that come with capabilities to steal sensitive information or plant a backdoor that establishes a persistent connection with an attacker-controlled server address and executes arbitrary code on the user’s host. “Malware in IDE plugins is a supply chain attack channel that enterprise security teams need to take seriously,” HelixGuard
said
. The development comes as Aikido reported that the threat actors behind the
GlassWorm campaign
targeting the VS Code extension marketplace and Open VSX have moved to GitHub, employing the same Unicode steganography trick to hide their malicious payloads within JavaScript projects. The supply chain security company said the use of hidden malicious code injected with invisible Unicode Private Use Area (PUA) characters was first observed in a set of malicious npm packages back in March 2025.</p>

<p>“These incidents highlight the need for better awareness around Unicode misuse, especially the dangers of invisible Private Use Area characters,” security researcher Ilyas Makari
said
. “Developers can only defend against what they can see, and right now, most tools are not showing them enough. Neither GitHub’s web interface nor VS Code displayed any sign that something was wrong.”
Proton Releases Data Breach Observatory
— Swiss privacy-focused company Proton has released
Data Breach Observatory
as a way to scan the dark web for leaks of sensitive data from enterprises. It said over 306.1 million records have been leaked from 794 breaches, with retail, technology, and media emerging as the most targeted sectors.</p>

<p>“Small- and medium-sized businesses (companies with 1–249 employees) accounted for 70.5% of the breaches reported,” the company
said
. “Larger companies (250–999 employees) accounted for 13.5% of data breaches, and enterprise organizations of more than 1,000+ employees accounted for the remaining 15.9%. SMBs are perfect targets for hackers, because while they might offer a smaller payday than an enterprise organization, they’re much easier to breach because they have fewer security protections in place.”
Russia Arrests 3 in
Connection with Meduza Infostealer
— Russian authorities
arrested
three individuals who are believed to have created and sold the Meduza infostealer. The suspects were arrested last week in the Moscow metropolitan area, according to Russia’s Interior Ministry.</p>

<p>Authorities said they seized computer equipment, phones, and bank cards during raids on the suspects’ homes. The Ministry’s spokesperson, Irina Volk,
said
the malware was used in attacks against at least one government network in the Astrakhan region. In a report published last September, Russian security firm BI.ZONE said Meduza was
used
in
multiple attacks
targeting Russian organizations last year. “The arrests of three alleged developers behind
Meduza Stealer
underscore a growing trend we flagged in
Dark Covenant 3.0
– namely, the shift from tolerated cyber-malign behavior toward selective enforcement by Russian authorities,” Alexander Leslie, senior advisor for government affairs at Recorded Future, told The Hacker News.</p>

<p>“While the takedown is noteworthy, Dark Covenant 3.0 cautions that this does not signal a full-scale disruption of the underground marketplace – many stealer services continue to proliferate and will likely adapt quickly. In short, while the arrests may temporarily disrupt this particular actor’s operations, the broader infostealer ecosystem remains resilient and warrants continued vigilance.”
Ukrainian National Extradited to U.S. for Conti Attacks
— A Ukrainian national believed to be a member of the Conti ransomware operation has been extradited to the U.S. “From in or around 2020 and continuing until about June 2022, Oleksii Oleksiyovych Lytvynenko, 43, of Cork, Ireland, conspired with others to deploy Conti ransomware to extort victims and steal their data,” the U.S.</p>

<p>Justice Department
said
. “Lytvynenko controlled data stolen from numerous Conti victims and was involved in the ransom notes deployed on the victims’ systems.” Lytvynenko was arrested by Irish authorities in July 2023. He is charged with computer fraud conspiracy and wire fraud conspiracy. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 5 years in prison for the computer fraud conspiracy and 20 years in prison for the wire fraud conspiracy.</p>

<p>According to estimates, Conti was used to attack more than 1,000 victims worldwide, resulting in at least $150 million in ransom payments as of January 2022. While the group shut down the “Conti” brand in 2022, its members have split into smaller crews and moved to other ransomware or extortion operations. Four of Lytvynenko’s alleged co-conspirators, Maksim Galochkin, Maksim Rudenskiy, Mikhail Mikhailovich Tsarev and Andrey Yuryevich Zhuykov, were indicted in 2023. FCC to Eliminate Cybersecurity Requirements for U.S.</p>

<p>Telcos
— The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) said it will vote next month to eliminate new cybersecurity requirements for telecommunication providers. “Following extensive FCC engagement with carriers, the item announces the substantial steps that providers have taken to strengthen their cybersecurity defenses,” Brendan Carr, chairman of the FCC,
said
. Denmark Backs Off from E.U.</p>

<p>Chat Control
— The Danish government has formally
withdrawn
its Chat Control legislation after the controversial proposal failed to garner majority support among E.U. bloc members. The German government, on October 8, announced it would not support the plan. While
Chat Control
was presented as a way to combat the threat arising from Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), critics of the proposal said it would mandate scanning of all private digital communications, including encrypted messages and photos, threatening privacy and security for all citizens in the region.</p>

<p>Poland Arrests 11 for Running Investment Scam
— Polish authorities have
arrested
11 suspects who ran an investment scam scheme that relied on call centers located overseas to trick Polish citizens into investing their money in bogus investment websites. The gang allegedly made more than $20 million from at least 1,500 victims. 4 New RATs Use Discord for C2
— Cybersecurity researchers have shed light on four new remote access trojans (RATs) that utilize the Discord platform for command-and-control (C2). This includes UwUdisRAT, STD RAT, Minecraft RAT, and Propionanilide RAT.</p>

<p>“Minecraft RAT […] is operated by a threat actor group who call themselves ‘STD Group,’” ReversingLabs
said
. “They also operate a series of very closely related RATs that use Discord as their C2 mechanism. The RATs are so closely related that they may be the same code base, just rebranded.” Propionanilide RAT, on the other hand, features a packer called Proplock or STD Crypter to decrypt and launch the Discord RAT functionality. Security Weaknesses in Tata Motors Sites
— A number of security issues have been
uncovered
in Tata Motors’ sites like E-Dukaan, FleetEdge, and cvtestdrive.tatamotors[.]com, including exposed Azuga API keys, two AWS keys, and an embedded “backdoor” account that granted unauthorized access to over 70 TB of sensitive information and infrastructure across hundreds of buckets, compromise its test drive fleet management system, gain admin access to a Tableau account managed by the conglomerate.</p>

<p>Following responsible disclosure by security researcher Eaton Zveare in August 2023 in coordination with India’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In), the issues were eventually addressed by early January 2024. In recent months, Zveare has also demonstrated methods to break into
Intel’s internal websites
and identified flaws in an unnamed automaker’s
centralized dealer platform
that could have been abused to gain complete control over the systems of more than 1,000 car dealerships in the U.S. by creating a national admin account. The researcher also
identified
an API-level security defect in an unspecified platform that granted the ability to access commands to start and stop power generators.</p>

<p>While the problem was rectified in October 2023, the platform is no longer active. Tangerine Turkey Uses Batch and Visual Basic Scripts to Drop Crypto Miners
— A cryptocurrency mining campaign dubbed Tangerine Turkey has been found leveraging batch files and Visual Basic Scripts to gain persistence, evade defenses, and deploy XMRig miners across victim environments. Since its emergence in late 2024, the campaign is assessed to have expanded in scope, targeting organizations indiscriminately across multiple industries and geographies. “Initial access in the Tangerine Turkey malware campaign is achieved through an infected USB device,” Cybereason
said
.</p>

<p>“The attack begins when the wscript.exe executes a malicious VB Script located on the removable drive. By leveraging living‑off-the‑land binaries such as wscript.exe and printui.exe, as well as registry modifications and decoy directories, the malware is able to evade traditional defenses and maintain persistence.”
Hezi Rash Targets Global Sites in Hacktivist Campaign
— A new ideologically-motivated threat actor known as Hezi Rash (meaning Black Force) has been linked to approximately 350 distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks targeting countries perceived as hostile to Kurdish or Muslim communities between August and October 2025. Founded in 2023, the Kurdish nationalist hacktivist group has described itself as a digital collective defending Kurdish society against cyber threats, per Check Point, while pushing a mix of nationalism, religion, and activism in its messaging. It’s believed that the threat actor is using tools and services from more established threat actors such as EliteStress, a DDoS-as-a-service (DaaS) platform linked to Keymous+, KillNet, and Project DDoSia and Abyssal DDoS v3.</p>

<p>“While the technical impact of these attacks, such as temporary website outages, is evident, the broader business consequences remain unclear,” Check Point
said
. “The attacks appear to be of the ‘usual variety,’ focusing on disruption rather than sophisticated exploitation.” The disclosure follows a report from Radware, highlighting a surge in claimed DDoS activity between October 6 and October 8, 2025, by hacktivist groups targeting Israel. Some of the key participating groups include Sylhet Gang, Keymous+, Arabian Ghosts, and NoName057(16). “On October 7 alone, more than 50 cyberattack claims against Israeli targets were recorded,” Radware
said
.</p>

<p>“The weekly average number of attacks claimed spiked to almost three times the average compared to the weeks preceding October 7. This sharp escalation underscores how hacktivist campaigns continue to use symbolic anniversaries to amplify their visibility and coordinate global action.”
Phishing Campaigns Distribute Lampion Stealer
— A Brazilian threat group has been spotted
employing
bank transfer receipt lures containing ZIP files to drop the
Lampion
stealer by means of ClickFix-style pages present within HTML pages present in the archive. The banking trojan has been active since at least 2019. “The first change was around mid September 2024, where the TAs started using ZIP attachments instead of links to a ZIP; the second change was around mid December 2024 with the introduction of ClickFix lures as a new social engineering technique; the last change was at the end of June 2025, where persistence capabilities were added to the first stage,” Bitsight
said
.</p>

<p>The command executed following ClickFix paves the way for three different VB Scripts that ultimately deploy the DLL stealer component of the malware. MITRE Releases ATT&amp;CK v18
— The MITRE Corporation has released an updated version of the ATT&amp;CK (v18) framework, which updates detections with two new objects: Detection Strategies for detecting specific attacker techniques and Analytics that provide platform-specific threat detection logic. “On the Mobile front, there’s coverage of state-sponsored abuse of Signal/WhatsApp-linked devices and enhanced account collection techniques,” MITRE
said
. “And in ICS, new and updated Asset objects expand the range of industrial equipment and attack scenarios ATT&amp;CK can represent, including improved connections across sector-specific terminology through Related Assets.”

<h2 id="the-evolution-of-soc-operations-how-continuous-exposure-management-transforms-security-operations"><a id="article-4"></a>The Evolution of SOC Operations: How Continuous Exposure Management Transforms Security Operations</h2>

<p>Security Operations Centers (SOC) today are overwhelmed. Analysts handle thousands of alerts every day, spending much time chasing false positives and adjusting detection rules reactively. SOCs often lack the environmental context and relevant threat intelligence needed to quickly verify which alerts are truly malicious. As a result, analysts spend excessive time manually triaging alerts, the majority of which are classified as benign.</p>

<p>Addressing the root cause of these blind spots and alert fatigue isn’t as simple as implementing more accurate tools. Many of these traditional tools are very accurate, but their fatal flaw is a lack of context and a narrow focus - missing the forest for the trees. Meanwhile, sophisticated attackers exploit exposures invisible to traditional reactive tools, often evading detection using
widely-available bypass kits
. While all of these tools are effective in their own right, they often fail because of the reality that attackers don’t employ just one attack technique, exploit just one type of exposure or weaponize a single CVE when breaching an environment.</p>

<p>Instead,
attackers chain together
multiple exposures, utilizing known CVEs where helpful, and employing evasion techniques to move laterally across an environment and accomplish their desired goals. Individually, traditional security tools may detect one or more of these exposures or IoCs, but without the context derived from a deeply integrated continuous exposure management program, it can be nearly impossible for security teams to effectively correlate otherwise seemingly disconnected signals. SecOps Benefits at Every Stage of the Cybersecurity Lifecycle
Exposure management platforms can help transform SOC operations by weaving exposure intelligence directly into existing analyst workflows. Of course, having attack surface visibility and insight into interconnected exposures provides immense value, but that’s just scratching the surface.</p>

<p>This really shouldn’t come as much of a surprise, given the significant overlap in the high-level models each team is operating, albeit often in parallel as opposed to working in tandem. To make the point further, I’ve included a comparison below between a typical SOC workflow and the CTEM lifecycle:
Typical SOC Lifecycle
How Integrated Exposure Management Helps
CTEM Lifecycle
Monitor
Maintain continuous visibility into the entire attack surface, prioritizing critical assets that matter most to the business and attackers are most likely to go after. Shared Attack Surface Visibility
Integration with CMDB and SOC tooling creates a unified view of the attack surface and critical assets, aligning security and IT teams on what matters most. Scope
Outline the scope of the exposure management program, identifying critical assets that matter most to the business, maintaining continuous visibility across the attack surface.</p>

<p>Detect
Identify suspicious and malicious activity across the attack surface, ideally before access is gained or critical systems and data are compromised. Contextualize Threat Alerts
When detections fire, analysts instantly see the asset’s risk posture and whether suspicious activity aligns with known attack paths, turning generic alerts into targeted investigations. Discover
Uncover exposures across the attack surface, including attack paths, vulnerabilities, misconfigs, identity and permissions issues, etc. Triage
Validate security alerts and correlate event logs to identify true security incidents and malicious activity vs benign anomalous activity.</p>

<p>Improve Disposition Accuracy
Make better-informed decisions with asset and business context to sift through the noise of security alerts while reducing the risk of false negatives. Prioritize
Prioritize discovered exposures based on threat intelligence, environment and business context to focus remediation operations on the most impactful and imminent risk. Investigate
Deep dive into threat intelligence, event logs and other findings to determine the blast radius, root cause, and impact of a security incident. Visualize Complex Attack Chains
Transform abstract risk findings into validated potential attack scenarios.</p>

<p>Analysts can visualize how threat actors would chain together specific exposures, identifying critical choke points. Validate
Confirm that discovered exposures are actually present, are reachable by threat actors and can actually be exploited based on patch availability and compensating controls. Respond
Take action to minimize breach impact and eliminate the threat within the environment. Targeted Incident Response
Understanding exploitable paths enables precise containment and remediation, addressing specific exposures quickly without disruptive over-isolation or business impact.</p>

<p>Mobilize
Drive efficient and effective remediation of exposures by driving cross-functional alignment, automating notification and ticketing workflows, and where possible, implementing security mitigations and automating patching workflows. This natural alignment between proactive and reactive teams’ high-level workflows makes it easy to see where the targeted threat and attack surface intelligence derived from exposure management platforms can be of use to SOC teams prior to and in the midst of a threat investigation. The magic really starts to happen when teams integrate their
exposure management platforms
with EDRs, SIEMs, and SOAR tools to deliver contextual threat intelligence precisely when and where SOC analysts need it most. This allows teams to automatically correlate discovered exposures with specific MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques, creating actionable threat intelligence that’s immediately relevant to each organization’s unique attack surface.</p>

<p>For exposures that can’t be immediately remediated, teams can leverage this intelligence to inform detection engineering and threat hunting activities. This creates a continuous feedback loop where exposure intelligence informs detection updates, improves alert triage and investigation, and supports automated response and prioritized remediation. A Deeper Dive Into SOC Workflows Enriched with Exposure Intelligence
Traditional detection tools generate alerts based on signatures and behavioral patterns, but lack environmental context. Continuous exposure management transforms this by providing real-time context about the systems, configurations, and vulnerabilities involved in each alert.</p>

<p>When an detection fires, SOC analysts immediately understand what exposures exist on the affected system, which attack techniques are viable given the current configuration, what the potential blast radius looks like and how this alert fits into known attack paths. Alert triage becomes dramatically more efficient when analysts can instantly assess the true risk potential of each alert. Instead of triaging based on generic severity scores, exposure management provides an environment-specific risk context. During investigation, continuous exposure management provides analysts with detailed attack path analysis showing exactly how an adversary could exploit the current alert as part of a broader campaign.</p>

<p>This includes understanding all viable attack paths based on actual network topology, access relationships, and system configurations. It also includes digging into the root cause of a breach, helping analysts determine the most likely breach points and paths an attacker would take. Response activities become more precise when guided by exposure intelligence. Instead of broad containment measures that might disrupt business operations, SOC teams can implement surgical responses that address the specific exposures being exploited.</p>

<p>The remediation phase extends beyond immediate incident response to systematic exposure reduction, automatically generating tickets that address not just the immediate incident, but the underlying conditions that made it possible. As remediation activities are completed, the same testing processes used to uncover security gaps can be used to validate that implemented changes actually worked and risk was reduced. With continuous exposure management integrated into the SecOps workflow, each incident becomes a learning opportunity that strengthens future detection and response capabilities. Understanding which exposures led to successful attacks during red teaming and validation testing helps refine and implement compensating controls and/or tune detection rules to catch similar activity earlier in the attack chain.</p>

<p>The Future of SOC Operations
The future of SOC operations
lies not in processing more alerts faster, but in preventing the conditions that generate unnecessary alerts while developing laser-focused capabilities against the threats that matter most. Continuous exposure management provides the environmental awareness that transforms generic security tools into precision instruments. In an era where threat actors are increasingly sophisticated and persistent, SOCs need every advantage they can get. The ability to proactively shape the battlefield, eliminating exposures, tuning detections, and developing custom capabilities based on environmental reality may be the difference between staying ahead of threats and constantly playing catch-up.</p>

<h2 id="researchers-uncover-bankbot-ynrk-and-deliveryrat-android-trojans-stealing-financial-data"><a id="article-5"></a>Researchers Uncover BankBot-YNRK and DeliveryRAT Android Trojans Stealing Financial Data</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have shed light on two different Android trojans called
BankBot-YNRK
and
DeliveryRAT
that are capable of harvesting sensitive data from compromised devices. According to CYFIRMA, which
analyzed
three different samples of BankBot-YNRK, the malware incorporates features to sidestep analysis efforts by first checking its running within a virtualized or emulated environment, and then extracting device details such as the manufacturer and model name to ascertain if it’s being executed on a real device. BankBot-YNRK also checks if the device is manufactured by Oppo, or is running on ColorOS, a version of the Android operating system that’s used on devices made by the Chinese original equipment manufacturer (OEM). “The malware also includes logic to identify specific devices,” CYFIRMA said.</p>

<p>“It verifies whether the device is a Google Pixel or a Samsung device and checks if its model is included in a predefined list of recognized or supported models. This allows the malware to apply device-specific functionality or optimizations only on targeted devices while avoiding execution on unrecognized models.”
The names of the APK packages distributing the malware are listed below. All three apps go by the name “IdentitasKependudukanDigital.apk,” which likely appears to be an attempt to impersonate a
legitimate Indonesian government app
called “Identitas Kependudukan Digital.”
com.westpacb4a.payqingynrk1b4a
com.westpacf78.payqingynrk1f78
com.westpac91a.payqingynrk191a
Once installed, the malicious apps are designed to harvest device information and set the volume of various audio streams, such as music, ringtone, and notifications, to zero to prevent the affected victim from being alerted to incoming calls, messages, and other in-app notifications. It also establishes communication with a remote server (“ping.ynrkone[.]top”), and upon receiving the “OPEN_ACCESSIBILITY” command, it urges the user to enable
accessibility services
so as to realize its goals, including gaining elevated privileges and performing malicious actions.</p>

<p>The malware, however, is capable of targeting only Android devices running versions 13 and below, as Android 14, launched in late 2023, introduced a new security feature that prevents the use of accessibility services to automatically request or grant app additional permissions. “Until Android 13, apps could bypass permission requests through accessibility features; however, with Android 14, this behavior is no longer possible, and users must grant permissions directly through the system interface,” CYFIRMA said. BankBot-YNRK leverages Android’s JobScheduler service to establish persistence on the device and ensure it’s launched after a reboot. It also supports a wide range of commands to gain device administrator privileges, manage apps, interact with the device, redirect incoming calls using MMI codes, take photos, perform file operations, and harvest contacts, SMS messages, locations, lists of installed apps, and clipboard content.</p>

<p>Some of the other features of the malware are as follows -
Impersonating Google News by programmatically replacing the apps’s name and icons, as well as launching “news.google[.]com” via a WebView
Capture screen content to reconstruct a “skeleton UI” of application screens such as banking apps to facilitate credential theft
Abusing accessibility services to open cryptocurrency wallet apps from a predefined list and automating UI actions to gather sensitive data and initiate unauthorized transactions
Retrieving a list of 62 financial apps to target
Displaying an overlay message claiming their personal information is being verified, while the malicious actions are carried out, including requesting itself extra permissions and adding itself as a device administrator app
“BankBot-YNRK exhibits a comprehensive feature set aimed at maintaining long-term access, stealing financial data, and executing fraudulent transactions on compromised Android devices,” CYFIRMA said. The disclosure comes as F6
revealed
that threat actors are distributing an updated version of DeliveryRAT targeting Russian Android device owners under the guise of food delivery services, marketplaces, banking services, as well as parcel tracking applications. The mobile threat is assessed to be active since mid-2024. According to the Russian cybersecurity company, the malware is
advertised
under a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model through a Telegram bot named Bonvi Team, allowing users to either get access to an APK file or links to phishing pages distributing the malware.</p>

<p>Victims are then approached on messaging apps like Telegram, where they are asked to download the malicious app as part of tracking orders from fake marketplaces or for a remote employment opportunity. Regardless of the method used, the app requests access to notifications and battery optimization settings so that it can gather sensitive data and run in the background without being terminated. Furthermore, the rogue apps come with capabilities to access SMS messages and call logs, and hide their own icons from the home screen launcher, thereby making it difficult for a less tech-savvy user to remove it from the device. Some iterations of the DeliveryRAT are also equipped to conduct distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks by making simultaneous requests to the URL link transmitted from the external server and launching activities to capture by making simultaneous requests to the URL link transmitted or by tricking the user into scanning a QR code.</p>

<p>The discovery of the two Android malware families coincides with a report from Zimperium, which discovered more than 760 Android apps since April 2024 that misuse near-field communication (NFC) to
illegally obtain payment data
and send it to a remote attacker. These fake apps, masquerading as financial applications, prompt users to set them as their default payment method, while taking advantage of Android’s host-based card emulation (
HCE
) to steal contactless credit card and payment data. The information is
relayed
either to a Telegram channel or a
dedicated tapper app
operated by the threat actors. The stolen NFC data is then used to withdraw funds from a user’s accounts or make purchases at point-of-sale (PoS) terminals almost instantly.</p>

<p>“Approximately 20 institutions have been impersonated – primarily Russian banks and financial services, but also target organizations in Brazil, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia,” the mobile security company
said

<h2 id="new-httptroy-backdoor-poses-as-vpn-invoice-in-targeted-cyberattack-on-south-korea"><a id="article-6"></a>New HttpTroy Backdoor Poses as VPN Invoice in Targeted Cyberattack on South Korea</h2>

<p>The North Korea-linked threat actor known as
Kimsuky
has distributed a previously undocumented backdoor codenamed HttpTroy as part of a likely spear-phishing attack targeting a single victim in South Korea. Gen Digital, which
disclosed details
of the activity, did not reveal any details on when the incident occurred, but noted that the phishing email contained a ZIP file (“250908_A_HK이노션_SecuwaySSL VPN Manager U100S 100user_견적서.zip”), which masqueraded as a VPN invoice to distribute malware capable of file transfer, capturing screenshots, and executing arbitrary commands. “The chain has three steps: a small dropper, a loader called MemLoad, and the final backdoor, named ‘HttpTroy,’” security researcher Alexandru-Cristian Bardaș said. Present within the ZIP archive is a SCR file of the same name, opening which triggered the execution chain, starting with a Golang binary containing three embedded files, including a decoy PDF document that’s displayed to the victim to avoid raising any suspicion.</p>

<p>Also launched simultaneously in the background is MemLoad, which is responsible for setting up persistence on the host by means of a scheduled task named “AhnlabUpdate,” an attempt to impersonate AhnLab, a South Korean cybersecurity company, and decrypt and execute the DLL backdoor (“HttpTroy”). The implant allows the attackers to gain complete control over the compromised system, enabling file upload/download, screenshot capture, command execution with elevated privileges, in-memory loading of executables, reverse shell, process termination, and trace removal. It communicates with the command-and-control (C2) server (“load.auraria[.]org”) over HTTP POST requests. “HttpTroy employs multiple layers of obfuscation to hinder analysis and detection,” Bardaș explained.</p>

<p>“API calls are concealed using custom hashing techniques, while strings are obfuscated through a combination of XOR operations and SIMD instructions. Notably, the backdoor avoids reusing API hashes and strings. Instead, it dynamically reconstructs them during runtime using varied combinations of arithmetic and logical operations, further complicating static analysis.”
The findings come as the cybersecurity vendor also detailed a
Lazarus Group
attack that led to the deployment of
Comebacker
and an upgraded version of its
BLINDINGCAN
(aka AIRDRY or ZetaNile) remote access trojan. The attack targeted two victims in Canada and was detected in the “middle of the attack chain,” it added.</p>

<p>While the exact initial access vector used in the attack is not known, it’s assessed to be a phishing email based on the absence of any known security vulnerabilities that could have been exploited to gain a foothold. Two different variants of Comebacker – one as a DLL and another as an EXE – have been put to use, with the former launched via a Windows service and the latter through “cmd.exe.” Irrespective of the method used to execute them, the end goal of the malware is the same: to decrypt an embedded payload (i.e., BLINDINGCAN) and deploy it as a service. BLINDINGCAN is designed to establish a connection with a remote C2 server (“tronracing[.]com”) and await further instructions that allow it to -
Upload/download files
Delete files
Alter a file’s attributes to mimic another file
Recursively enumerate all files and sub-directories for a specified path
Gather data about files across the entire file system
Collect system metadata
List running processes
Run a command-line using
CreateProcessW
Execute binaries directly in memory
Execute commands using “cmd.exe”
Terminate a specific process by passing a process ID as input
Take screenshots
Take pictures from the available video capture devices
Update configuration
Change current working directory
Delete itself and remove all traces of malicious activity
“Kimsuky and Lazarus continue to sharpen their tools, showing that DPRK-linked actors aren’t just maintaining their arsenals, they’re reinventing them,” Gen Digital said. “These campaigns demonstrate a well-structured and multi-stage infection chain, leveraging obfuscated payloads and stealthy persistence mechanisms.”
“From the initial stages to the final backdoors, each component is designed to evade detection, maintain access and provide extensive control over the compromised system.</p>

<p>The use of custom encryption, dynamic API resolution and COM-based task registration/services exploitation highlights the groups’ continued evolution and technical sophistication.”

<h2 id="asd-warns-of-ongoing-badcandy-attacks-exploiting-cisco-ios-xe-vulnerability"><a id="article-7"></a>ASD Warns of Ongoing BADCANDY Attacks Exploiting Cisco IOS XE Vulnerability</h2>

<p>The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) has
issued
a bulletin about ongoing cyber attacks targeting unpatched Cisco IOS XE devices in the country with a previously undocumented implant known as
BADCANDY
. The activity, per the intelligence agency, involves the exploitation of
CVE-2023-20198
(CVSS score: 10.0), a critical vulnerability that allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to create an account with elevated privileges and use it to seize control of susceptible systems. The security defect has come under active exploitation in the wild since last 2023, with China-linked threat actors like
Salt Typhoon
weaponizing it in recent months to breach telecommunications providers. ASD noted that variations of BADCANDY have been detected since October 2023, with a fresh set of attacks continuing to be recorded in 2024 and 2025.</p>

<p>As many as 400 devices in Australia are estimated to have been compromised with the malware since July 2025, out of which 150 devices were infected in October alone. “BADCANDY is a low equity Lua-based web shell, and cyber actors have typically applied a non-persistent patch post-compromise to mask the device’s vulnerability status in relation to CVE-2023-20198,” it said. “In these instances, the presence of the BADCANDY implant indicates compromise of the Cisco IOS XE device, via CVE-2023-20198.”
The lack of a persistence mechanism means it cannot survive across system reboots. However, if the device remains unpatched and exposed to the internet, it’s possible for the threat actor to re-introduce the malware and regain access to it.</p>

<p>ASD has assessed that the threat actors are able to detect when the implant is removed and are infecting the devices again. This is based on the fact that re-exploitation has occurred on devices for which the agency has previously issued notifications to affected entities. That having said, a reboot will not undo other actions undertaken by the attackers. It’s therefore essential that system operators apply the patches, limit public exposure of the web user interface, and follow necessary
hardening guidelines
issued by Cisco to prevent future exploitation attempts.</p>

<p>Some of the other actions outlined by the agency are listed below -
Review the running configuration for accounts with privilege 15 and remove unexpected or unapproved accounts
Review accounts with random strings or “cisco_tac_admin,” “cisco_support,” “cisco_sys_manager,” or “cisco” and remove them if not legitimate
Review the running configuration for unknown tunnel interfaces
Review TACACS+ AAA command accounting logging for configuration changes, if enabled

<h2 id="openai-unveils-aardvark-gpt-5-agent-that-finds-and-fixes-code-flaws-automatically"><a id="article-8"></a>OpenAI Unveils Aardvark: GPT-5 Agent That Finds and Fixes Code Flaws Automatically</h2>

<p>OpenAI has announced the launch of an “agentic security researcher” that’s powered by its GPT-5 large language model (LLM) and is programmed to emulate a human expert capable of scanning, understanding, and patching code. Called
Aardvark
, the artificial intelligence (AI) company said the autonomous agent is designed to help developers and security teams flag and fix security vulnerabilities at scale. It’s currently available in private beta. “Aardvark continuously analyzes source code repositories to identify vulnerabilities, assess exploitability, prioritize severity, and propose targeted patches,” OpenAI
noted
.</p>

<p>It works by embedding itself into the software development pipeline, monitoring commits and changes to codebases, detecting security issues and how they might be exploited, and proposing fixes to address them using LLM-based reasoning and tool-use. Powering the agent is
GPT‑5
, which OpenAI introduced in August 2025. The company describes it as a “smart, efficient model” that features deeper reasoning capabilities, courtesy of GPT‑5 thinking, and a “real‑time router” to decide the right model to use based on conversation type, complexity, and user intent. Aardvark, OpenAI added, analyses a project’s codebase to produce a threat model that it thinks best represents its security objectives and design.</p>

<p>With this contextual foundation, the agent then scans its history to identify existing issues, as well as detect new ones by scrutinizing incoming changes to the repository. Once a potential security defect is found, it attempts to trigger it in an isolated, sandboxed environment to confirm its exploitability and leverages
OpenAI Codex
, its coding agent, to produce a patch that can be reviewed by a human analyst. OpenAI said it’s been running the agent across OpenAI’s internal codebases and some of its external alpha partners, and that it has helped identify at least 10 CVEs in open-source projects. The AI upstart is far from the only company to trial AI agents to tackle automated vulnerability discovery and patching.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Google announced
CodeMender
that it said detects, patches, and rewrites vulnerable code to prevent future exploits. The tech giant also noted that it intends to work with maintainers of critical open-source projects to integrate CodeMender-generated patches to help keep projects secure. Viewed in that light, Aardvark, CodeMender, and
XBOW
are being positioned as tools for continuous code analysis, exploit validation, and patch generation. It also comes close on the heels of OpenAI’s release of the
gpt-oss-safeguard models
that are fine-tuned for safety classification tasks.</p>

<p>“Aardvark represents a new defender-first model: an agentic security researcher that partners with teams by delivering continuous protection as code evolves,” OpenAI said. “By catching vulnerabilities early, validating real-world exploitability, and offering clear fixes, Aardvark can strengthen security without slowing innovation. We believe in expanding access to security expertise.”

<h2 id="nation-state-hackers-deploy-new-airstalk-malware-in-suspected-supply-chain-attack"><a id="article-9"></a>Nation-State Hackers Deploy New Airstalk Malware in Suspected Supply Chain Attack</h2>

<p>A suspected nation-state threat actor has been linked to the distribution of a new malware called Airstalk as part of a likely supply chain attack. Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 said it’s tracking the cluster under the moniker
CL-STA-1009
, where “CL” stands for cluster and “STA” refers to state-backed motivation. “Airstalk misuses the AirWatch API for mobile device management (MDM), which is now called Workspace ONE Unified Endpoint Management,” security researchers Kristopher Russo and Chema Garcia
said
in an analysis. “It uses the API to establish a covert command-and-control (C2) channel, primarily through the AirWatch feature to manage custom device attributes and file uploads.”
The malware, which appears in PowerShell and .NET variants, makes use of a multi-threaded command-and-control (C2) communication protocol and is capable of capturing screenshots and harvesting cookies, browser history, bookmarks, and screenshots from web browsers.</p>

<p>It’s believed that the threat actors are leveraging a stolen certificate to sign some of the artifacts. Unit 42 said the .NET variant of Airstalk is equipped with more capabilities than its PowerShell counterpart, suggesting it could be an advanced version of the malware. The PowerShell variant, for its part, utilizes the “
/api/mdm/devices/
“ endpoint for C2 communications. While the endpoint is designed to fetch content details of a particular device, the malware uses the custom attributes feature in the API to use it as a dead drop resolver for storing information necessary for interacting with the attacker.</p>

<p>Once launched, the backdoor initializes contact by sending a “CONNECT” message and awaits a “CONNECTED” message from the server. It then receives various tasks to be executed on the compromised host in the form of a message of type “ACTIONS.” The output of the execution is sent back to the threat actor using a “RESULT” message. The backdoor supports seven different ACTIONS, including taking a screenshot, getting cookies from Google Chrome, listing all user Chrome profiles, obtaining browser bookmarks of a given profile, collecting the browser history of a given Chrome profile, enumerating all files within the user’s directory, and uninstalling itself from the host. “Some tasks require sending back a large amount of data or files after Airstalk is executed,” Unit 42 said.</p>

<p>“To do so, the malware uses the blobs feature of the AirWatch MDM API to upload the content as a new blob.”
The .NET variant of Airstalk expands on the capabilities by also targeting Microsoft Edge and Island, an enterprise-focused browser, while attempting to mimic an AirWatch Helper utility (“AirwatchHelper.exe”). Furthermore, it supports three more message types -
MISMATCH, for flagging version mismatch errors
DEBUG, for sending debug messages
PING, for beaconing
In addition, it uses three different execution threads, each of which serves a unique purpose: to manage C2 tasks, exfiltrate the debug log, and beacon to the C2 server. The malware also supports a broader set of commands, although one of them appears not to have been implemented yet -
Screenshot, to take a screenshot
UpdateChrome, to exfiltrate a specific Chrome profile
FileMap, to list the contents of the specific directory
RunUtility (not implemented)
EnterpriseChromeProfiles, to fetch available Chrome profiles
UploadFile, to exfiltrate specific Chrome artifacts and credentials
OpenURL, to open a new URL in Chrome
Uninstall, to finish the execution
EnterpriseChromeBookmarks, to fetch Chrome bookmarks from a specific user profile
EnterpriseIslandProfiles, to fetch available Island browser profiles
UpdateIsland, to exfiltrate a specific Island browser profile
ExfilAlreadyOpenChrome, to dump all cookies from the current Chrome profile
Interestingly, while the PowerShell variant uses a scheduled task for persistence, its .NET version lacks such a mechanism. Unit 42 said some of the .NET variant samples are signed with a “likely stolen” certificate signed by a valid certificate authority (Aoteng Industrial Automation (Langfang) Co., Ltd.), with early iterations featuring a compilation timestamp of June 28, 2024.</p>

<p>It’s currently not known how the malware is distributed, or who may have been targeted in these attacks. But the use of MDM-related APIs for C2 and the targeting of enterprise browsers like Island suggest the possibility of a supply chain attack targeting the business process outsourcing (BPO) sector. “Organizations specializing in BPO have become lucrative targets for both criminal and nation-state attackers,” it said. “Attackers are willing to invest generously in the resources necessary to not only compromise them but maintain access indefinitely.”
“The evasion techniques employed by this malware allow it to remain undetected in most environments.</p>

<p>This is particularly true if the malware is running within a third-party vendor’s environment. This is particularly disastrous for organizations that use BPO because stolen browser session cookies could allow access to a large number of their clients.”

<h2 id="china-linked-hackers-exploit-windows-shortcut-flaw-to-target-european-diplomats"><a id="article-10"></a>China-Linked Hackers Exploit Windows Shortcut Flaw to Target European Diplomats</h2>

<p>A China-affiliated threat actor known as
UNC6384
has been linked to a fresh set of attacks exploiting an unpatched Windows shortcut vulnerability to target European diplomatic and government entities between September and October 2025. The activity targeted diplomatic organizations in Hungary, Belgium, Italy, and the Netherlands, as well as government agencies in Serbia, Arctic Wolf
said
in a technical report published Thursday. “The attack chain begins with spear-phishing emails containing an embedded URL that is the first of several stages that lead to the delivery of malicious LNK files themed around European Commission meetings, NATO-related workshops, and multilateral diplomatic coordination events,” the cybersecurity company said. The files are designed to exploit ZDI-CAN-25373 to trigger a multi-stage attack chain that culminates in the deployment of the
PlugX
malware using DLL side-loading.</p>

<p>PlugX is a
remote access trojan
that’s also referred to as Destroy RAT, Kaba, Korplug, SOGU, and TIGERPLUG. UNC6384 was the
subject
of a recent analysis by Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG), which described it as a cluster with tactical and tooling overlaps with a hacking group known as Mustang Panda. The threat actor has been observed delivering a memory-resident variant of PlugX called SOGU.SEC. The latest attack wave uses phishing emails with diplomatic lures to entice recipients into opening a bogus attachment that’s designed to exploit
ZDI-CAN-25373
, a vulnerability that has been put to use by multiple threat actors as far back as 2017 to execute hidden malicious commands on a victim’s machine.</p>

<p>It’s officially tracked as
CVE-2025-9491
(CVSS score: 7.0)
The existence of the bug was first reported by security researchers Peter Girnus and Aliakbar Zahravi in March 2025. A subsequent report from HarfangLab
found
that the shortcoming has also been abused by a cyber espionage cluster known as XDSpy to distribute a Go-based malware called XDigo in attacks targeting Eastern European governmental entities in March 2025. At that time, Microsoft told The Hacker News that Microsoft Defender has detections in place to detect and block this threat activity, and that Smart App Control provides an extra layer of protection by blocking malicious files from the Internet. Specifically, the LNK file is designed to launch a PowerShell command to decode and extract the contents of a TAR archive and simultaneously display a decoy PDF document to the user.</p>

<p>The archive contains three files: A legitimate Canon printer assistant utility, a malicious DLL dubbed CanonStager that’s sideloaded using the binary, and an encrypted PlugX payload (“cnmplog.dat”) that’s launched by the DLL. “The malware provides comprehensive remote access capabilities including command execution, keylogging, file upload and download operations, persistence establishment, and extensive system reconnaissance functions,” Arctic Wolf said. “Its modular architecture allows operators to extend functionality through plugin modules tailored to specific operational requirements.”
PlugX also implements various anti-analysis techniques and anti-debugging checks to resist efforts to unpack its internals and fly under the radar. It achieves persistence by means of a Windows Registry modification.</p>

<p>Arctic Wolf said the CanonStager artifacts found in early September and October 2025 have witnessed a steady decline in size from approximately 700 KB to 4 KB, indicating active development and its evolution into a minimal tool capable of achieving its goals without leaving much of a forensic footprint. Furthermore, in what’s being perceived as a refinement of the malware delivery mechanism, UNC6384 has been found to leverage an HTML Application (HTA) file in early September to load an external JavaScript that, in turn, retrieves the malicious payloads from a cloudfront[.]net subdomain. “The campaign’s focus on European diplomatic entities involved in defense cooperation, cross-border policy coordination, and multilateral diplomatic frameworks aligns with PRC strategic intelligence requirements concerning European alliance cohesion, defense initiatives, and policy coordination mechanisms,” Arctic Wolf concluded.

<h2 id="china-linked-tick-group-exploits-lanscope-zero-day-to-hijack-corporate-systems"><a id="article-11"></a>China-Linked Tick Group Exploits Lanscope Zero-Day to Hijack Corporate Systems</h2>

<p>The exploitation of a recently disclosed critical security flaw in Motex Lanscope Endpoint Manager has been
attributed
to a cyber espionage group known as
Tick
. The vulnerability, tracked as
CVE-2025-61932
(CVSS score: 9.3), allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands with SYSTEM privileges on on-premise versions of the program. JPCERT/CC, in an alert issued this month, said that it has confirmed reports of active abuse of the security defect to drop a backdoor on compromised systems. Tick, also known as Bronze Butler, Daserf, REDBALDKNIGHT, Stalker Panda, Stalker Taurus, and Swirl Typhoon (formerly Tellurium), is a
suspected
Chinese cyber espionage actor known for its extensive targeting of East Asia, specifically Japan.</p>

<p>It’s assessed to be active since at least 2006. “We’re aware of very targeted activity in Japan and believe the exploitation by Bronze Butler was limited to sectors aligned with their intelligence objectives,” Rafe Pilling, director of threat intelligence at Sophos CTU, told The Hacker News. “Since this vulnerability is now publicly disclosed, other threat actors may seek to exploit it.”
The sophisticated campaign, observed by Sophos, involved the exploitation of CVE-2025-61932 to deliver a known backdoor referred to as
Gokcpdoor
that can establish a proxy connection with a remote server and act as a backdoor to execute malicious commands on the compromised host. “The 2025 variant discontinued support for the KCP protocol and added multiplexing communication using a third-party library [
smux
] for its C2 [command-and-control] communication,” the Sophos Counter Threat Unit (CTU) said in a Thursday report.</p>

<p>The cybersecurity company said it detected two different types of Gokcpdoor serving distinct use-cases -
A server type that listens for incoming client connections to enable remote access
A client type that initiates connections to hard-coded C2 servers with the goal of setting up a covert communication channel
The attack is also characterized by the deployment of the Havoc post-exploitation framework on select systems, with the infection chains relying on DLL side-loading to launch a DLL loader named OAED Loader to inject the payloads. Some of the other tools utilized in the attack to facilitate lateral movement and data exfiltration include
goddi
, an open-source Active Directory information dumping tool; Remote Desktop, for remote access through a backdoor tunnel; and 7-Zip. The threat actors have also been found to access cloud services such as io, LimeWire, and Piping Server via the web browser during remote desktop sessions in an effort to exfiltrate the harvested data. This is not the first time Tick has been observed leveraging a zero-day flaw in its attack campaigns.</p>

<p>In October 2017, Sophos-owned Secureworks
detailed
the hacking group’s exploitation of a then-unpatched remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2016-7836) in SKYSEA Client View, a Japanese IT asset management software, to compromise machines and steal data. “Organizations upgrade vulnerable Lanscope servers as appropriate in their environments,” Sophos TRU said. “Organizations should also review internet-facing Lanscope servers that have the Lanscope client program (MR) or detection agent (DA) installed to determine if there is a business need for them to be publicly exposed.”
(The story was updated after publication to include a response from Sophos.)

<h2 id="the-msp-cybersecurity-readiness-guide-turning-security-into-growth"><a id="article-12"></a>The MSP Cybersecurity Readiness Guide: Turning Security into Growth</h2>

<p>MSPs are facing rising client expectations for strong cybersecurity and compliance outcomes, while threats grow more complex and regulatory demands evolve. Meanwhile, clients are increasingly seeking comprehensive protection without taking on the burden of managing security themselves. This shift represents a major growth opportunity. By delivering advanced cybersecurity and compliance services, MSPs can build deeper relationships, generate higher-value recurring revenue streams, and stand out in a competitive market.</p>

<p>However, the move from basic IT and security services to strategic cybersecurity offerings requires more than technical expertise. It demands a clear service strategy, the right internal resources, and the ability to communicate security value in business terms. Without this foundation, MSPs risk inconsistent service delivery, missed opportunities, and stalled growth. We created the guide
Turn Security Into Growth: Is Your MSP Ready to Expand?</p>

<p>to help providers pinpoint their current capabilities. It includes a structured checklist for evaluating both strategic mindset and operational readiness. Mindset Readiness: From Technical Support to Business Value
Traditional IT services keep systems operational. Cybersecurity ensures those systems remain protected, resilient, and able to support uninterrupted business operations.</p>

<p>This requires a security-first mindset that extends beyond technical execution to address risk management, compliance, and resilience as integral components of the client’s overall business strategy. Two mindset shifts are essential:
From Checkbox Compliance to Continuous Risk Management
Compliance is often treated as the finish line, the moment a business can pass audits and meet regulatory obligations. For MSPs aiming to deliver advanced cybersecurity and compliance services, it can be helpful to view compliance as the starting point instead. Regulations establish a baseline; Unfortunately, the reality is that threats often evolve faster than standards change.</p>

<p>Viewing compliance as one part of an ongoing risk management process enables MSPs to uncover broader business risks, address them proactively, and help clients build resilience. From Technical Delivery to Strategic Outcomes
Technical execution, such as deploying tools, configuring firewalls, and patching systems, is only part of the bigger picture. The greatest impact comes when these activities are connected to what matters most to the business: protecting revenue streams, maintaining operational continuity, safeguarding reputation, and supporting long-term growth. Framing security conversations in terms of business impact rather than technical detail can help clients better understand the value of your services.</p>

<p>When security is positioned in this way, MSPs are often seen less as vendors and more as strategic partners contributing to resilience and shared success. Assessing Mindset Readiness: Are You Positioned for Strategic Security? A security-first mindset involves engaging clients in meaningful conversations, framing services in a way that aligns with their goals, and making clear connections between security initiatives and business value. Consider:
Do you have a strong understanding of your clients’ most critical business processes and the systems that support them?</p>

<p>Can you estimate the potential business impact if a critical system is unavailable for a day, a week, or longer? Is your team able to explain security risks and benefits without relying on technical jargon? Do your reports and discussions consistently link security to uptime, revenue protection, and overall resilience? If several of these questions are difficult to answer confidently, it may signal an opportunity to deepen business understanding and strengthen the way security value is communicated.</p>

<p>Operational Readiness: Can You Scale? The guide
Turn Security Into Growth: Is Your MSP Ready to Expand? doesn’t just break preparedness into categories, it provides a detailed checklist to help assess your readiness in each area. This structured approach ensures you can pinpoint strengths, identify gaps, and create a clear plan for scaling security services effectively.</p>

<p>Key categories include:
Service Definition:
Map offerings to client needs and compliance frameworks to create packaged tiers with clear value. Staffing &amp; Expertise:
Define and fill critical roles, whether in-house or outsourced, to cover compliance, incident response, and cybersecurity analysis. Tool Alignment &amp; Management:
Ensure tools match the service scope and are actively managed by trained personnel. Financial Planning:
Budget for tools, training, and liability coverage to support sustainable growth.</p>

<p>Process Documentation:
Standardize incident response, compliance workflows, and data handling procedures. Sales Capability:
Equip sales teams to communicate business outcomes, not just technical features. Strategic Client Engagement:
Be able to lead roadmap discussions that connect security to business goals. Assessing Operational Readiness: Are You Positioned for Strategic Security?</p>

<p>If you can confidently check most of these boxes, your MSP is in a strong position to scale security services profitably. If not, this is your opportunity to strengthen operational foundations before committing to expansion. From Readiness to Revenue
An MSP with a strong foundation in both mindset and operational capability can scale security services confidently, deliver measurable value, and unlock new revenue streams. Whether you’re laying the groundwork or ready to refine your approach, our guide
Turn Security Into Growth: Is Your MSP Ready to Expand?</p>

<p>offers a clear framework for assessing strengths, closing capability gaps, and building a profitable expansion into advanced security and compliance services. It walks you through both mindset and operational readiness, helping you identify where you can scale confidently, deliver measurable value, and unlock new revenue opportunities while avoiding the pitfalls of reactive service and competitive disadvantage.
