<h2 id="researchers-find-vs-code-flaw-allowing-attackers-to-republish-deleted-extensions-under-same-names"><a id="article-1"></a>Researchers Find VS Code Flaw Allowing Attackers to Republish Deleted Extensions Under Same Names</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a loophole in the Visual Studio Code Marketplace that allows threat actors to reuse names of previously removed extensions. Software supply chain security outfit ReversingLabs
said
it made the discovery after it identified a malicious extension named ‚ÄúahbanC.shiba‚Äù that functioned similarly to two other extensions ‚Äì ahban.shiba and ahban.cychelloworld ‚Äì that were
flagged
earlier this March. All three libraries are designed to act as a downloader to retrieve a PowerShell payload from an external server that encrypts files in a folder called ‚ÄútestShiba‚Äù on the victim‚Äôs Windows desktop and demands a Shiba Inu token by depositing the assets to an unspecified wallet. These efforts suggest ongoing development attempts by the threat actor.</p>

<p>The company said it decided to dig deeper because of the fact that the name of the new extension (‚ÄúahbanC.shiba‚Äù) was virtually the same as one of the two others previously identified (‚Äúahban.shiba‚Äù). It‚Äôs worth noting that each extension has to have a unique ID that‚Äôs a combination of the publisher name and the name of the extension (i.e., <publisher>.<name>). In the case investigated by ReversingLabs, both extensions are differentiated only by the name of the publisher, while the actual name of the extension remains the same. However,
according
to Visual Studio Code documentation, the <name> field specified in the extension manifest "should be all lowercase with no spaces" and "must be unique to the Marketplace."
"So how did extensions ahban.shiba and ahbanC.shiba end up having the same name despite the official documentation's publishing rules?," asked security researcher Lucija Valentiƒá, who ultimately found that it is possible to do so once the extension is removed from the repository.</name></name></publisher></p>

<p>But this behavior doesn‚Äôt apply to scenarios where an author unpublishes an extension. It‚Äôs worth noting that the ability to reuse the name of deleted libraries also applies to the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository, as
demonstrated
by ReversingLabs in early 2023. At the time, it was found that deleting a package would make its project name ‚Äúavailable to any other PyPI user‚Äù as long as the distribution file names (a combination of the project name, version number, and distribution type) are different from those used in the now-removed distribution. However, PyPI carves out an exception where PyPI package names can be made unavailable if they were first used by malicious packages.</p>

<p>It appears that Visual Studio Code does not have a similar restriction to prevent the reuse of names of malicious extensions. The development, as
observed
in
leaked Black Basta chat logs
, shows how threat actors are looking at poisoning open-source registries with ransomware libraries that demand ransoms from unsuspecting victims who may install them. This makes it all the more crucial for organizations and developers to adopt secure development practices and proactively monitor these ecosystems for software supply chain threats. ‚ÄúThe discovery of this loophole exposes a new threat: that the name of any removed extension can be reused, and by anyone,‚Äù Valentiƒá said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat means that if some legitimate and very popular extension is removed, its name is up for grabs.‚Äù
The findings also follow the
identification
of eight malicious npm packages that have been found to deliver a Google Chrome browser information stealer targeting Windows systems that‚Äôs capable of transmitting passwords, credit cards, cryptocurrency wallet data, and user cookies to a railway[.]app URL or a Discord webhook as a fallback mechanism. The packages, published by users named ruer and npjun, are listed below -
toolkdvv (versions 1.1.0, 1.0.0)
react-sxt (version 2.4.1)
react-typex (version 0.1.0)
react-typexs (version 0.1.0)
react-sdk-solana (version 2.4.1)
react-native-control (version 2.4.1)
revshare-sdk-api (version 2.4.1)
revshare-sdk-apii (version 2.4.1)
What‚Äôs notable about these packages is the use of 70 layers of obfuscated code to unpack a Python payload that‚Äôs engineered to facilitate data theft and exfiltration. ‚ÄúOpen-source software repositories have become one of the main entry points for attackers as part of supply chain attacks, with growing waves using typosquatting and masquerading, pretending to be legitimate,‚Äù JFrog security researcher Guy Korolevski said. ‚ÄúThe impact of sophisticated multi-layer campaigns designed to evade traditional security and steal sensitive data highlights the importance of having visibility across the entire software supply chain with rigorous automated scanning and a single source of truth for all software components.‚Äù

<h2 id="salt-typhoon-exploits-cisco-ivanti-palo-alto-flaws-to-breach-600-organizations-worldwide"><a id="article-2"></a>Salt Typhoon Exploits Cisco, Ivanti, Palo Alto Flaws to Breach 600 Organizations Worldwide</h2>

<p>The China-linked advanced persistent threat (APT) actor known as
Salt Typhoon
has continued its attacks targeting networks across the world, including organizations in the telecommunications, government, transportation, lodging, and military infrastructure sectors. ‚ÄúWhile these actors focus on large backbone routers of major telecommunications providers, as well as provider edge (PE) and customer edge (CE) routers, they also leverage compromised devices and trusted connections to pivot into other networks,‚Äù according to a
joint cybersecurity advisory
published Wednesday. ‚ÄúThese actors often modify routers to maintain persistent, long-term access to networks.‚Äù
The
bulletin
, courtesy of authorities from 13 countries, said the malicious activity has been linked to three Chinese entities, Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing Huanyu Tianqiong Information Technology Co., Ltd., and Sichuan Zhixin Ruijie Network Technology Co., Ltd. These companies, the agencies said, provide cyber-related products and services to China‚Äôs intelligence services, with the data stolen from the intrusions, specifically those against telecoms and Internet service providers (ISPs), providing Beijing with the ability to identify and track their targets‚Äô communications and movements globally.</p>

<p>The countries that have co-sealed the security advisory include Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Spain, the U.K., and the U.S. Brett Leatherman, head of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation‚Äôs Cyber Division,
said
the Salt Typhoon group has been active since at least 2019, engaging in a persistent espionage campaign aimed at ‚Äúbreaching global telecommunications privacy and security norms.‚Äù
In a standalone alert issued today, Dutch intelligence and security services MIVD and AIVD
said
while organizations in the country ‚Äúdid not receive the same degree of attention from the Salt Typhoon hackers as those in the U.S.,‚Äù the threat actors gained access to routers of smaller ISPs and hosting providers. However, there is no evidence the hackers penetrated these networks further.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSince at least 2021, this activity has targeted organisations in critical sectors including government, telecommunications, transportation, lodging, and military infrastructure globally, with a cluster of activity observed in the U.K.,‚Äù the National Cyber Security Centre
said
. According to
The Wall Street Journal
and
The Washington Post
, the hacking crew has expanded its targeting focus to other sectors and regions, attacking no less than 600 organizations, including 200 in the U.S., and 80 countries. Salt Typhoon, which
overlaps
with activity tracked as GhostEmperor, Operator Panda, RedMike, and UNC5807, has been observed obtaining initial access through the exploitation of
exposed network edge devices
from Cisco (
CVE-2018-0171
,
CVE-2023-20198
, and
CVE-2023-20273
), Ivanti (
CVE-2023-46805
and
CVE-2024-21887
), and Palo Alto Networks (
CVE-2024-3400
). ‚ÄúThe APT actors may target edge devices regardless of who owns a particular device,‚Äù the agencies noted.</p>

<p>‚ÄúDevices owned by entities that do not align with the actors‚Äô core targets of interest still present opportunities for use in attack pathways into targets of interest.‚Äù
The compromised devices are then leveraged to pivot into other networks, in some cases even
modifying the device‚Äôs configuration
and adding a generic routing encapsulation (GRE) tunnel for persistent access and data exfiltration. Persistent access to target networks is accomplished by altering Access Control Lists (ACLs) to add IP addresses under their control, opening standard and non-standard ports, and running commands in an on-box Linux container on supported Cisco networking devices to stage tools, process data locally, and move laterally within the environment. Also put to use by the attackers are authentication protocols like Terminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus (
TACACS+
) to enable lateral movement across network devices, while simultaneously conducting extensive discovery actions and capturing network traffic containing credentials via compromised routers to burrow deeper into the networks. ‚ÄúThe APT actors collected PCAPs using native tooling on the compromised system, with the primary objective likely being to capture TACACS+ traffic over TCP port 49,‚Äù the agencies said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúTACACS+ traffic is used for authentication, often for administration of network equipment and including highly privileged network administrators‚Äô accounts and credentials, likely enabling the actors to compromise additional accounts and perform lateral movement.‚Äù
On top of that, Salt Typhoon has been observed enabling the sshd_operns service on Cisco IOS XR devices to create a local user and grant it sudo privileges to obtain root on the host OS after logging in via TCP/57722. Google-owned Mandiant, which was one of the many industry partners that contributed to the advisory, stated the threat actor‚Äôs familiarity with telecommunications systems offers them a unique advantage, giving them an upper hand when it comes to defense evasion. ‚ÄúAn ecosystem of contractors, academics, and other facilitators is at the heart of Chinese cyber espionage,‚Äù John Hultquist, Chief Analyst at Google Threat Intelligence Group, told The Hacker News. Contractors are used to build tools and valuable exploits as well as carry out the dirty work of intrusion operations.</p>

<p>They have been instrumental in the rapid evolution of these operations and growing them to an unprecedented scale.‚Äù
‚ÄúIn addition to targeting telecommunications, reported targeting of hospitality and transportation by this actor could be used to closely surveil individuals. Information from these sectors can be used to develop a full picture of who someone is talking to, where they are, and where they are going.‚Äù

<h2 id="hidden-vulnerabilities-of-project-management-tools--how-fluentpro-backup-secures-them"><a id="article-4"></a>Hidden Vulnerabilities of Project Management Tools &amp; How FluentPro Backup Secures Them</h2>

<p>Every day, businesses, teams, and project managers trust platforms like Trello, Asana, etc., to collaborate and manage tasks. But what happens when that trust is broken? According to a recent report by Statista, the average cost of a data breach worldwide was about $4.88 million. Also, in 2024, the private data of over 15 million Trello user profiles was shared on a popular hacker forum.</p>

<p>Yet, most organizations and project managers still assume that their platform‚Äôs built-in backups are enough until they are not. The next few paragraphs will expose some risks of relying on these platform tools alone and how to better protect yourself and your organization from data loss with
cloud backup and recovery
. Why are project management tools becoming a prime target for data loss? More than 95% of businesses today rely heavily on project management tools like Trello and Asana to organize tasks, collaborate with teams, and track project milestones.</p>

<p>However, as project managers become more deeply integrated into these tools for their daily operations and storing massive data volumes in one place, two major threats arise: human errors and cyber threats. Tiny human errors that cause massive data disasters
Data is one of the most critical assets of every organization. It helps them understand customer behaviour, market trends, and internal performance. Also, for project managers, it provides insight into project timelines, risk management, resource allocation, and team productivity.</p>

<p>When used effectively, it can be used to forecast business sales and revenue. However, while cyberattacks and natural disasters can lead to data loss, the human element is the most common cause. For example, teams and project managers that juggle multiple tasks and deadlines in a shared workspace create ample room for accidental deletions and mistakes. Also, according to a study conducted by the Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA), human error accounts for 52 percent of the root causes of security breaches.</p>

<p>Other common human errors include misconfigured user permissions, unintended bulk actions, archiving projects too early, etc. The growing threat of cyberattacks
Most project management tools today are cloud-based, enabling teams to collaborate remotely. However, they have also become attractive to cybercriminals. Cyberattacks such as phishing and ransomware are targeting these platforms with a lot of sensitive information that might cripple a business if found in the wrong hands.</p>

<p>For instance, data reports by DocuClipper have it that ‚Äú60% of small businesses that are victims of a Cyber Attack go out of business within six months‚Äù. That is why you, as a project manager, need the proper information security to protect your data from such threats. Are built-in security features enough to protect your project data? The answer is No!</p>

<p>And here is why. While most SaaS-based project management tools like Monday com, Trello, and Asana have basic built-in features such as role-based access control, data encryption, and authentication, they are not fully designed to protect against costly mistakes caused by human error. For project managers, this could mean the difference between staying on schedule and facing expensive delays. Limitations of native security project management tools
No version history or rollback
.</p>

<p>Many project management tools don‚Äôt offer full versioning, making restoring to the previous state difficult. Limited recovery windows
. Platforms like Asana retain deleted tasks for 30 days. After that, it is permanently deleted without a trace.</p>

<p>Basic trash bins aren‚Äôt enough
. For instance, if a team member accidentally deletes a task, and it‚Äôs not caught quickly, it might be impossible to restore such a task. Lack of protection against internal mistakes. Built-in features cannot stop major errors like accidental deletion of an entire board or misconfiguration of settings.</p>

<p>Third-party backup: the missing layer in your SaaS project management tools
Project managers and team leaders must be proactive when dealing with SaaS tools. And that includes having a third-party cloud backup for business. While SaaS project management platforms are efficient and feature-rich, they are vulnerable and are not immune to data loss. The rising cyber-attack threats, human error, compliance, and audit readiness have made third-party backup solutions essential for data protection.</p>

<p>Leverage FluentPro Backup for Project Management Software

<h2 id="malicious-nx-packages-in-s1ngularity-attack-leaked-2349-github-cloud-and-ai-credentials"><a id="article-5"></a>Malicious Nx Packages in ‚Äòs1ngularity‚Äô Attack Leaked 2,349 GitHub, Cloud, and AI Credentials</h2>

<p>The maintainers of the nx build system have alerted users to a supply chain attack that allowed attackers to publish malicious versions of the popular npm package and other auxiliary plugins with data-gathering capabilities. ‚ÄúMalicious versions of the nx package, as well as some supporting plugin packages, were published to npm, containing code that scans the file system, collects credentials, and posts them to GitHub as a repo under the user‚Äôs accounts,‚Äù the maintainers
said
in an advisory published Wednesday. Nx is an open-source, technology-agnostic build platform that‚Äôs designed to manage codebases. It‚Äôs advertised as an ‚ÄúAI-first build platform that connects everything from your editor to CI [continuous integration].‚Äù The npm package has over 3.5 million weekly downloads.</p>

<p>The list of affected packages and versions is below. These versions have since been removed from the npm registry. The compromise of the nx package took place on August 26, 2025. nx 21.5.0, 20.9.0, 20.10.0, 21.6.0, 20.11.0, 21.7.0, 21.8.0, 20.12.0
@nx/devkit 21.5.0, 20.9.0
@nx/enterprise-cloud 3.2.0
@nx/eslint 21.5.0
@nx/js 21.5.0, 20.9.0
@nx/key 3.2.0
@nx/node 21.5.0, 20.9.0
@nx/workspace 21.5.0, 20.9.0
The project maintainers said the root cause of the issue stemmed from a
vulnerable workflow
added on August 21, 2025, that introduced the ability to inject executable code using a specially crafted title in a pull request (PR).</p>

<p>While the workflow was reverted in the ‚Äúmaster‚Äù branch ‚Äúalmost immediately‚Äù after it found to be exploitable in a malicious context, the threat actor is assessed to have made a PR targeting an outdated branch that still contained the workflow to launch the attack. ‚ÄúThe pull_request_target trigger was used as a way to trigger the action to run whenever a PR was created or modified,‚Äù the nx team said. ‚ÄúHowever, what was missed is the warning that this trigger, unlike the standard pull_request trigger, runs workflows with elevated permissions, including a GITHUB_TOKEN which has read/write repository permission.‚Äù
It‚Äôs believed the GITHUB_TOKEN was utilized to trigger the ‚Äúpublish.yml‚Äù workflow, which is responsible for publishing the nx packages to the registry using an npm token. But with the PR validation workflow running with elevated privileges, the ‚Äúpublish.yml workflow‚Äù is triggered to run on the ‚Äúnrwl/nx‚Äù repository while also introducing
malicious changes
that made it possible to exfiltrate the npm token to an attacker-controlled webhook[.]site endpoint.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAs part of the bash injection, the PR validation workflows triggered a run of the publish.yml with this malicious commit and sent our npm token to an unfamiliar webhook,‚Äù the nx team explained. ‚ÄúWe believe this is how the user got a hold of the npm token used to publish the malicious versions of nx.‚Äù
In other words, the injection flaw enabled arbitrary command execution if a malicious PR title was submitted, while the pull_request_target trigger granted elevated permissions by providing a GITHUB_TOKEN with read/write access to the repository. The rogue versions of the packages have been found to contain a postinstall script that‚Äôs activated after package installation to scan a system for text files, collect credentials, and send the details as a Base64-encoded string to a publicly accessible GitHub repository containing the name ‚Äús1ngularity-repository‚Äù (or ‚Äús1ngularity-repository-0‚Äù and ‚Äús1ngularity-repository-1‚Äù) under the user‚Äôs account. ‚ÄúThe malicious postinstall script also modified the .zshrc and .bashrc files which are run whenever a terminal is launched to include sudo shutdown -h 0 which prompt users for their system password and if provided, would shut down the machine immediately,‚Äù the maintainers added.</p>

<p>While GitHub has since started to archive these repositories, users who encounter the repositories are advised to assume compromise and rotate GitHub and npm credentials and tokens. Users are also recommended to stop using the malicious packages and check .zshrc and .bashrc files for any unfamiliar instructions and remove them. Image Source: GitGuardian
The nx team said they have also undertaken remedial actions by rotating their npm and GitHub tokens, auditing GitHub and npm activities across the organization for suspicious activities, and updating Publish access for nx to require two-factor authentication (2FA) or automation. Wiz researchers Merav Bar and Rami McCarthy said 90% of over 1,000 leaked GitHub tokens are still valid, as well as dozens of valid cloud credentials and npm tokens.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs said the malware was run on developer machines, often via the nx Visual Studio Code extension. As many as 1,346 repositories with the string ‚Äús1ngularity-repository‚Äù have been detected by GitGuardian. Among the 2,349 distinct secrets leaked, the vast majority of them
account
for GitHub OAuth keys and personal access tokens (PATs), followed by API keys and credentials for Google AI, OpenAI, Amazon Web Services, OpenRouter, Anthropic Claude, PostgreSQL, and Datadog. The cloud security firm found that the payload is capable of running only on Linux and macOS systems, systematically searching for sensitive files and extracting credentials, SSH keys, and .gitconfig files.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNotably, the campaign weaponized installed AI CLI tools by prompting them with dangerous flags (‚Äìdangerously-skip-permissions, ‚Äìyolo, ‚Äìtrust-all-tools) to steal file system contents, exploiting trusted tools for malicious reconnaissance,‚Äù the company
said
. StepSecurity said the incident marks the first known case where attackers have turned developer AI assistants like Claude, Google Gemini, and Amazon Q into tools for supply chain exploitation and bypass traditional security boundaries. ‚ÄúThere are a few differences between the malware in the scoped nx packages (i.e. @nx/devkit, @nx/eslint) versus the malware in the nx package,‚Äù Socket
said
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúFirst, the AI prompt is different. In these packages, the AI prompt is a bit more basic. This LLM prompt is also much less broad in scope, targeting crypto-wallet keys and secret patterns as well as specific directories, whereas the ones in @nx grabs any interesting text file.‚Äù
Charlie Eriksen of Aikido
said
the use of LLM clients as a vector for enumerating secrets on the victim machine is a novel approach, and gives defenders insight into the direction the attackers may be heading in the future. ‚ÄúGiven the popularity of the nx ecosystem, and the novelty of AI tool abuse, this incident highlights the evolving sophistication of supply chain attacks,‚Äù StepSecurity‚Äôs Ashish Kurmi
said
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúImmediate remediation is critical for anyone who installed the compromised versions.‚Äù

<h2 id="us-treasury-sanctions-dprk-it-worker-scheme-exposing-600k-crypto-transfers-and-1m-profits"><a id="article-6"></a>U.S. Treasury Sanctions DPRK IT-Worker Scheme, Exposing $600K Crypto Transfers and $1M+ Profits</h2>

<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury‚Äôs Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced a fresh round of sanctions against two individuals and two entities for their role in the North Korean remote information technology (IT) worker scheme to generate illicit revenue for the regime‚Äôs weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs. ‚ÄúThe North Korean regime continues to target American businesses through fraud schemes involving its overseas IT workers, who steal data and demand ransom,‚Äù
said
Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence John K. Hurley.</p>

<p>‚ÄúUnder President Trump, Treasury is committed to protecting Americans from these schemes and holding the guilty accountable.‚Äù
The key players targeted include Vitaliy Sergeyevich Andreyev, Kim Ung Sun, Shenyang Geumpungri Network Technology Co., Ltd, and Korea Sinjin Trading Corporation. The latest effort expands the scope of sanctions
imposed against
Chinyong Information Technology Cooperation Company in May 2023. Chinyong,
according to insider risk management firm DTEX
, is one of the many IT companies that have deployed IT workers for engaging in freelance IT work and cryptocurrency theft. It has offices in China, Laos, and Russia.</p>

<p>The
years-long IT worker threat
, also tracked as Famous Chollima, Jasper Sleet, UNC5267, and Wagemole, is assessed to be affiliated with the Workers‚Äô Party of Korea. At its core, the scheme works by embedding North Korean IT workers in legitimate companies in the U.S. and elsewhere, securing these jobs using fraudulent documents, stolen identities, and
false personas
on GitHub, CodeSandbox, Freelancer, Medium, RemoteHub, CrowdWorks, and WorkSpace.ru. Select cases have also
involved
the threat actors clandestinely introducing malware into company networks to exfiltrate proprietary and sensitive data, and extort them in return for not leaking the information.</p>

<p>In a report published Wednesday, Anthropic revealed how the employment fraud operation has leaned heavily on artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools like Claude to create convincing professional backgrounds and technical portfolios, tailor resumes to specific job descriptions, and even deliver actual technical work. ‚ÄúThe most striking finding is the actors‚Äô complete dependency on AI to function in technical roles,‚Äù Anthropic
said
. ‚ÄúThese operators do not appear to be able to write code, debug problems, or even communicate professionally without Claude‚Äôs assistance. Yet they‚Äôre successfully maintaining employment at Fortune 500 companies (according to public reporting), passing technical interviews, and delivering work that satisfies their employers.‚Äù
The Treasury Department said Andreyev, a 44-year-old Russian national, has facilitated payments to Chinyong and has worked with Kim Ung Sun, a North Korean economic and trade consular official based in Russia, to conduct multiple financial transfers worth nearly $600,000 by converting cryptocurrency to cash in U.S.</p>

<p>dollars since December 2024. Shenyang Geumpungri, the department added, is a Chinese front company for Chinyong that consists of a delegation of DPRK IT workers, generating over $1 million in profits for Chinyong and Sinjin since 2021. ‚ÄúSinjin is a DPRK [Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea] company subordinate to the U.S.-sanctioned DPRK Ministry of People‚Äôs Armed Forces General Political Bureau,‚Äù the Treasury said. ‚ÄúThe company has received directives from DPRK government officials regarding the DPRK IT workers that Chinyong deploys internationally.‚Äù
The announcement comes a little over a month after the Treasury Department
sanctioned
a North Korean front company (Korea Sobaeksu Trading Company) and three associated individuals (Kim Se Un, Jo Kyong Hun, and Myong Chol Min) for their involvement in the IT worker scheme.</p>

<p>In parallel, an Arizona woman was awarded an eight-year prison sentence for running a laptop farm that enabled the actors to connect remotely to companies‚Äô networks. Last month, the department also
sanctioned
Song Kum Hyok, a member of a North Korean hacking group called Andariel, alongside a Russian national (Gayk Asatryan) and four entities (Asatryan LLC, Fortuna LLC, Korea Songkwang Trading General Corporation, and Korea Saenal Trading Corporation) for their participation in the sanctions-evading scheme.

<h2 id="storm-0501-exploits-entra-id-to-exfiltrate-and-delete-azure-data-in-hybrid-cloud-attacks"><a id="article-7"></a>Storm-0501 Exploits Entra ID to Exfiltrate and Delete Azure Data in Hybrid Cloud Attacks</h2>

<p>The financially motivated threat actor known as
Storm-0501
has been observed refining its tactics to conduct data exfiltration and extortion attacks targeting cloud environments. ‚ÄúUnlike traditional on-premises ransomware, where the threat actor typically deploys malware to encrypt critical files across endpoints within the compromised network and then negotiates for a decryption key, cloud-based ransomware introduces a fundamental shift,‚Äù the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team
said
in a report shared with The Hacker News. ‚ÄúLeveraging cloud-native capabilities, Storm-0501 rapidly exfiltrates large volumes of data, destroys data and backups within the victim environment, and demands ransom ‚Äì all without relying on traditional malware deployment.‚Äù
Storm-0501 was
first documented
by Microsoft almost a year ago, detailing its hybrid cloud ransomware attacks targeting government, manufacturing, transportation, and law enforcement sectors in the U.S., with the threat actors pivoting from on-premises to cloud for subsequent data exfiltration, credential theft, and ransomware deployment. The Windows maker told The Hacker News the latest wave of attacks targeting is opportunistic and not sector-specific, and that multiple organizations including schools, healthcare, and other entities have been attacked by the e-crime crew.</p>

<p>Assessed to be active since 2021, the hacking group has evolved into a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) affiliate delivering various ransomware payloads over the years, such as Sabbath, Hive, BlackCat (ALPHV), Hunters International, LockBit, and Embargo. ‚ÄúStorm-0501 has continued to demonstrate proficiency in moving between on-premises and cloud environments, exemplifying how threat actors adapt as hybrid cloud adoption grows,‚Äù the company said. ‚ÄúThey hunt for unmanaged devices and security gaps in hybrid cloud environments to evade detection and escalate cloud privileges and, in some cases, traverse tenants in multi-tenant setups to achieve their goals.‚Äù
Typical attack chains involve the threat actor abusing their initial access to achieve privilege escalation to a domain administrator, followed by on-premises lateral movement and reconnaissance steps that allow the attackers to breach the target‚Äôs cloud environment, thereby initiating a multi-stage sequence involving persistence, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, encryption, and extortion. Initial access, per Microsoft, is achieved through intrusions facilitated by access brokers like Storm-0249 and Storm-0900, taking advantage of stolen, compromised credentials to sign in to the target system, or exploiting various known remote code execution vulnerabilities in unpatched public-facing servers.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAccess brokers typically sell or provide footholds into organizations, which ransomware operators then use to launch their attacks,‚Äù Sherrod DeGrippo, Director of Threat Intelligence Strategy at Microsoft, said. ‚ÄúIn the past, Storm-0501 and its affiliates have exploited known remote code execution vulnerabilities in unpatched, internet-facing servers, including products like Zoho ManageEngine, Citrix NetScaler, and Adobe ColdFusion 2016. By targeting these vulnerabilities, threat actors can bypass perimeter defenses and establish a presence inside the network, setting the stage for further compromise and ransomware deployment.‚Äù
In a recent campaign targeting an unnamed large enterprise with multiple subsidiaries, Storm-0501 is said to have conducted reconnaissance before laterally moving across the network using
Evil-WinRM
. The attackers also carried out what‚Äôs called a
DCSync Attack
to
extract credentials
from
Active Directory
by
simulating
the behavior of a domain controller.</p>

<p>‚ÄúLeveraging their foothold in the Active Directory environment, they traversed between Active Directory domains and eventually moved laterally to compromise a second Entra Connect server associated with a different Entra ID tenant and Active Directory domain,‚Äù Microsoft said. ‚ÄúThe threat actor extracted the Directory Synchronization Account to repeat the reconnaissance process, this time targeting identities and resources in the second tenant.‚Äù
These efforts ultimately enabled Storm-0501 to identify a non-human synced identity with a Global Admin role in Microsoft Entra ID on that tenant, and lacking in multi-factor authentication (MFA) protections. This subsequently opened the door to a scenario where the attackers reset the user‚Äôs on-premises password, causing it to be synced to the cloud identity of that user using the Entra Connect Sync service. Armed with the compromised Global Admin account, the digital intruders have been found to access the Azure Portal, registering a threat actor-owned Entra ID tenant as a trusted federated domain to create a backdoor, and then elevate their access to critical Azure resources, before setting the stage for data exfiltration and extortion.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAfter completing the exfiltration phase, Storm-0501 initiated the mass-deletion of the Azure resources containing the victim organization data, preventing the victim from taking remediation and mitigation action by restoring the data,‚Äù Microsoft said. ‚ÄúAfter successfully exfiltrating and destroying the data within the Azure environment, the threat actor initiated the extortion phase, where they contacted the victims using Microsoft Teams using one of the previously compromised users, demanding ransom.‚Äù
The company said it has enacted a change in Microsoft Entra ID that prevents threat actors from abusing
Directory Synchronization Accounts
to escalate privileges. It has also released updates to Microsoft Entra Connect (
version 2.5.3.0
) to support Modern Authentication to allow customers to configure application-based authentication for enhanced security. ‚ÄúIt is also important to enable Trusted Platform Module (TPM) on the Entra Connect Sync server to securely store sensitive credentials and cryptographic keys, mitigating Storm-0501‚Äôs credential extraction techniques,‚Äù the tech giant added.</p>

<p>(The story was updated after publication to include responses from Microsoft.)

<h2 id="someone-created-the-first-ai-powered-ransomware-using-openais-gpt-oss20b-model"><a id="article-8"></a>Someone Created the First AI-Powered Ransomware Using OpenAI‚Äôs gpt-oss:20b Model</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity company ESET has disclosed that it discovered an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered ransomware variant codenamed
PromptLock
. Written in Golang, the newly identified strain uses the gpt-oss:20b model from OpenAI locally via the Ollama API to generate malicious Lua scripts in real-time. The open-weight language model was
released
by OpenAI earlier this month. ‚ÄúPromptLock leverages Lua scripts generated from hard-coded prompts to enumerate the local filesystem, inspect target files, exfiltrate selected data, and perform encryption,‚Äù ESET
said
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThese Lua scripts are cross-platform compatible, functioning on Windows, Linux, and macOS.‚Äù
The ransomware code also embeds instructions to craft a custom note based on the ‚Äúfiles affected,‚Äù and the infected machine is a personal computer, company server, or a power distribution controller. It‚Äôs currently not known who is behind the malware, but ESET told The Hacker News that PromptLoc artifacts were uploaded to VirusTotal from the United States on August 25, 2025. ‚ÄúPromptLock uses Lua scripts generated by AI, which means that indicators of compromise (IoCs) may vary between executions,‚Äù the Slovak cybersecurity company pointed out. ‚ÄúThis variability introduces challenges for detection.</p>

<p>If properly implemented, such an approach could significantly complicate threat identification and make defenders‚Äô tasks more difficult.‚Äù
Assessed to be a proof-of-concept (PoC) rather than a fully operational malware deployed in the wild, PromptLock uses the
SPECK 128-bit encryption algorithm
to lock files. Besides encryption, analysis of the ransomware artifact suggests that it could also be used to exfiltrate data or even destroy it, although the functionality to actually perform the erasure appears not yet to be implemented. ‚ÄúPromptLock does not download the entire model, which could be several gigabytes in size,‚Äù ESET clarified. ‚ÄúInstead, the attacker can simply establish a proxy or tunnel from the compromised network to a server running the Ollama API with the gpt-oss-20b model.‚Äù
The emergence of PromptLock is another sign that AI has made it easier for cybercriminals, even those who lack technical expertise, to quickly
set up new campaigns
, develop malware, and create compelling phishing content and malicious sites.</p>

<p>Earlier today, Anthropic
revealed
that it had banned accounts created by two different threat actors that used its Claude AI chatbot to commit large-scale theft and extortion of personal data targeting at least 17 distinct organizations, and developed several variants of ransomware with advanced evasion capabilities, encryption, and anti-recovery mechanisms. The development comes as large language models (LLMs) powering various chatbots and AI-focused developer tools, such as Amazon Q Developer, Anthropic Claude Code, AWS Kiro, Butterfly Effect Manus, Google Jules,
Lenovo Lena
, Microsoft GitHub Copilot, OpenAI ChatGPT Deep Research, OpenHands, Sourcegraph Amp, and Windsurf, have been
found susceptible
to prompt injection attacks, potentially allowing information disclosure, data exfiltration, and code execution. Despite incorporating robust security and safety guardrails to avoid undesirable behaviors, AI models have repeatedly
fallen prey
to novel variants of injections and jailbreaks, underscoring the complexity and evolving nature of the security challenge. ‚ÄúPrompt injection attacks can cause AIs to delete files, steal data, or make financial transactions,‚Äù Anthropic
said
.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNew forms of prompt injection attacks are also constantly being developed by malicious actors.‚Äù
What‚Äôs more, new research has uncovered a simple yet clever attack called PROMISQROUTE ‚Äì short for ‚ÄúPrompt-based Router Open-Mode Manipulation Induced via SSRF-like Queries, Reconfiguring Operations Using Trust Evasion‚Äù ‚Äì that abuses ChatGPT‚Äôs model routing mechanism to trigger a downgrade and cause the prompt to be sent to an older, less secure model, thus allowing the system to bypass safety filters and produce unintended results. ‚ÄúAdding phrases like ‚Äòuse compatibility mode‚Äô or ‚Äòfast response needed‚Äô bypasses millions of dollars in AI safety research,‚Äù Adversa AI
said
in a report published last week, adding the attack targets the cost-saving model-routing mechanism used by AI vendors. Found this article interesting? Follow us on

<h2 id="anthropic-disrupts-ai-powered-cyberattacks-automating-theft-and-extortion-across-critical-sectors"><a id="article-9"></a>Anthropic Disrupts AI-Powered Cyberattacks Automating Theft and Extortion Across Critical Sectors</h2>

<p>Anthropic on Wednesday revealed that it disrupted a sophisticated operation that
weaponized
its artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbot Claude to conduct large-scale theft and extortion of personal data in July 2025. ‚ÄúThe actor targeted at least 17 distinct organizations, including in healthcare, the emergency services, and government, and religious institutions,‚Äù the company
said
. ‚ÄúRather than encrypt the stolen information with traditional ransomware, the actor threatened to expose the data publicly in order to attempt to extort victims into paying ransoms that sometimes exceeded $500,000.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe actor employed Claude Code on Kali Linux as a comprehensive attack platform, embedding operational instructions in a CLAUDE.md file that provided persistent context for every interaction.‚Äù
The unknown threat actor is said to have used AI to an ‚Äúunprecedented degree,‚Äù using Claude Code, Anthropic‚Äôs agentic coding tool, to automate various phases of the attack cycle, including reconnaissance, credential harvesting, and network penetration. The reconnaissance efforts involved scanning thousands of VPN endpoints to flag susceptible systems, using them to obtain initial access and following up with user enumeration and network discovery steps to extract credentials and set up persistence on the hosts.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the attacker used Claude Code to craft bespoke versions of the Chisel tunneling utility to sidestep detection efforts, and disguise malicious executables as legitimate Microsoft tools ‚Äì an indication of how AI tools are being used to assist with malware development with defense evasion capabilities. The activity, codenamed GTG-2002, is notable for employing Claude to make ‚Äútactical and strategic decisions‚Äù on its own and allowing it to decide which data needs to be exfiltrated from victim networks and craft targeted extortion demands by analyzing the financial data to determine an appropriate ransom amount ranging from $75,000 to $500,000 in Bitcoin. Claude Code, per Anthropic, was also put to use to organize stolen data for monetization purposes, pulling out thousands of individual records, including personal identifiers, addresses, financial information, and medical records from multiple victims. Subsequently, the tool was employed to create customized ransom notes and multi-tiered extortion strategies based on exfiltrated data analysis.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAgentic AI tools are now being used to provide both technical advice and active operational support for attacks that would otherwise have required a team of operators,‚Äù Anthropic said. ‚ÄúThis makes defense and enforcement increasingly difficult, since these tools can adapt to defensive measures, like malware detection systems, in real-time.‚Äù
To mitigate such ‚Äúvibe hacking‚Äù threats from occurring in the future, the company said it developed a custom classifier to screen for similar behavior and shared technical indicators with ‚Äúkey partners.‚Äù
Other documented misuses of Claude are listed below -
Use of Claude by North Korean operatives related to the
fraudulent remote IT worker scheme
in order to create elaborate fictitious personas with persuasive professional backgrounds and project histories, technical and coding assessments during the application process, and assist with their day-to-day work once hired
Use of Claude by a U.K.-based cybercriminal, codenamed GTG-5004, to develop, market, and distribute several variants of ransomware with advanced evasion capabilities, encryption, and anti-recovery mechanisms, which were then sold on darknet forums such as Dread, CryptBB, and Nulled to other threat actors for $400 to $1,200
Use of Claude by a Chinese threat actor to enhance cyber operations targeting Vietnamese critical infrastructure, including telecommunications providers, government databases, and agricultural management systems, over the course of a 9-month campaign
Use of Claude by a Russian-speaking developer to create malware with advanced evasion capabilities
Use of Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Claude by a threat actor operating on the xss[.]is cybercrime forum with the goal of analyzing stealer logs and build detailed victim profiles
Use of Claude Code by a Spanish-speaking actor to maintain and improve an invite-only web service geared towards validating and reselling stolen credit cards at scale
Use of Claude as part of a
Telegram bot
that offers multimodal AI tools to support
romance scam operations
, advertising the chatbot as a ‚Äúhigh EQ model‚Äù
Use of Claude by an unknown actor to launch an operational synthetic identity service that rotates between three card validation services, aka ‚Äúcard checkers‚Äù
The company also said it foiled attempts made by North Korean threat actors linked to the
Contagious Interview campaign
to create accounts on the platform to enhance their malware toolset, create phishing lures, and generate npm packages, effectively blocking them from issuing any prompts. The case studies add to growing evidence that AI systems, despite the various guardrails baked into them, are being abused to facilitate sophisticated schemes at speed and at scale. ‚ÄúCriminals with few technical skills are using AI to conduct complex operations, such as developing ransomware, that would previously have required years of training,‚Äù Anthropic‚Äôs Alex Moix, Ken Lebedev, and Jacob Klein said, calling out AI‚Äôs ability to lower the barriers to cybercrime.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCybercriminals and fraudsters have embedded AI throughout all stages of their operations. This includes profiling victims, analyzing stolen data, stealing credit card information, and creating false identities allowing fraud operations to expand their reach to more potential targets.‚Äù

<h2 id="shadowsilk-hits-35-organizations-in-central-asia-and-apac-using-telegram-bots"><a id="article-10"></a>ShadowSilk Hits 35 Organizations in Central Asia and APAC Using Telegram Bots</h2>

<p>A threat activity cluster known as
ShadowSilk
has been attributed to a fresh set of attacks targeting government entities within Central Asia and Asia-Pacific (APAC). According to Group-IB, nearly three dozen victims have been identified, with the intrusions mainly geared towards data exfiltration. The hacking group shares toolset and infrastructural overlaps with campaigns undertaken by threat actors dubbed YoroTrooper, SturgeonPhisher, and Silent Lynx. Victims of the group‚Äôs campaigns span Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Tajikistan, Pakistan, and Turkmenistan, a majority of which are government organizations, and to a lesser extent, entities in the energy, manufacturing, retail, and transportation sectors.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe operation is run by a bilingual crew ‚Äì Russian-speaking developers tied to legacy YoroTrooper code and Chinese-speaking operators spearheading intrusions, resulting in a nimble, multi-regional threat profile,‚Äù researchers Nikita Rostovcev and Sergei Turner
said
. ‚ÄúThe exact depth and nature of cooperation of these two sub-groups remains still uncertain.‚Äù
YoroTrooper was
first publicly documented
by Cisco Talos in March 2023, detailing its attacks targeting government, energy, and international organizations across Europe since at least June 2022. The group is
believed
to be active as far back as 2021, per ESET. A subsequent analysis later that year
revealed
that the hacking group likely consists of individuals from Kazakhstan based on their fluency in Kazakh and Russian, as well as what appeared to be deliberate efforts to avoid targeting entities in the country.</p>

<p>Then earlier this January, Seqrite Labs
uncovered
cyber attacks orchestrated by an adversary dubbed Silent Lynx that singled out various organizations in Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan. It also characterized the threat actor as having overlaps with YoroTrooper. ShadowSilk represents the latest evolution of the threat actor, leveraging spear-phishing emails as the initial access vector to drop password-protected archives to drop a custom loader that hides command-and-control (C2) traffic behind Telegram bots to evade detection and deliver additional payloads. Persistence is achieved by modifying the Windows Registry to run them automatically after a system reboot.</p>

<p>The threat actor also employs public exploits for Drupal (
CVE-2018-7600
and
CVE-2018-76020
and the WP-Automatic WordPress plugin (
CVE-2024-27956
), alongside leveraging a diverse toolkit comprising reconnaissance and penetration-testing tools such as FOFA, Fscan, Gobuster, Dirsearch, Metasploit, and Cobalt Strike. Furthermore, ShadowSilk has incorporated into its arsenal JRAT and Morf Project web panels acquired from darknet forums for managing infected devices, and a bespoke tool for stealing Chrome password storage files and the associated decryption key. Another notable aspect is its compromise of legitimate websites to host malicious payloads. ‚ÄúOnce inside a network, ShadowSilk deploys web shells [like ANTSWORD, Behinder, Godzilla, and FinalShell], Sharp-based post-exploitation tools, and tunneling utilities such as Resocks and Chisel to move laterally, escalate privileges and siphon data,‚Äù the researchers said.</p>

<p>The attacks have been observed paving the way for a Python-based remote access trojan (RAT) that can receive commands and exfiltrate data to a Telegram bot, thereby allowing the malicious traffic to be disguised as legitimate messenger activity. Cobalt Strike and Metasploit modules are used to grab screenshots and webcam pictures, while a custom PowerShell script scans for files matching a predefined list of extensions and copies them into a ZIP archive, which is then transmitted to an external server. The Singaporean company has assessed that the operators of the YoroTrooper group are fluent in Russian, and are likely engaged in malware development and facilitating initial access. However, a series of screenshots capturing one of the attackers‚Äô workstations ‚Äì featuring images of the active keyboard layout, automatic translation of Kyrgyzstan government websites into Chinese, and a Chinese language vulnerability scanner ‚Äì indicates the involvement of a Chinese-speaking operator, it added.</p>

<p>‚ÄúRecent behavior indicates that the group remains highly active, with new victims identified as recently as July,‚Äù Group-IB said. ‚ÄúShadowSilk continues to focus on the government sector in Central Asia and the broader APAC region, underscoring the importance of monitoring its infrastructure to prevent long-term compromise and data exfiltration.‚Äù

<h2 id="the-5-golden-rules-of-safe-ai-adoption"><a id="article-11"></a>The 5 Golden Rules of Safe AI Adoption</h2>

<p>Employees are experimenting with AI at record speed. They are drafting emails, analyzing data, and transforming the workplace. The problem is not the pace of AI adoption, but the lack of control and safeguards in place. For CISOs and security leaders like you, the challenge is clear: you don‚Äôt want to slow AI adoption down, but you must make it safe.</p>

<p>A policy sent company-wide will not cut it. What‚Äôs needed are practical principles and technological capabilities that create an innovative environment without an open door for a breach. Here are the five rules you cannot afford to ignore. Rule #1: AI Visibility and Discovery
The oldest security truth still applies: you cannot protect what you cannot see.</p>

<p>Shadow IT was a headache on its own, but shadow AI is even slipperier. It is not just ChatGPT, it‚Äôs also the embedded AI features that exist in many SaaS apps and any new AI agents that your employees might be creating. The golden rule: turn on the lights. You need real-time visibility into AI usage, both stand-alone and embedded.</p>

<p>AI discovery should be continuous and not a one-time event. Rule #2: Contextual Risk Assessment
Not all AI usage carries the same level of risk. An AI grammar checker used inside a text editor doesn‚Äôt carry the same risk as an AI tool that connects directly to your CRM. Wing enriches each discovery with meaningful context so you can get contextual awareness, including:
Who the vendor is and their reputation in the market
If your data being used for AI training and if it‚Äôs configurable
Whether the app or vendor has a history of breaches or security issues
The app‚Äôs compliance adherence (SOC 2, GDPR, ISO, etc.)
If the app connects to any other systems in your environment
The golden rule: context matters.</p>

<p>Prevent leaving gaps that are big enough for attackers to exploit. Your AI security platform should give you contextual awareness to make the right decisions about which tools are in use and if they are safe. Rule #3: Data Protection
AI thrives on data, which makes it both powerful and risky. If employees feed sensitive information into applications with AI without controls, you risk exposure, compliance violations, and devastating consequences in the event of a breach.</p>

<p>The question is not if your data will end up in AI, but how to ensure it is protected along the way. The golden rule: data needs a seatbelt. Put boundaries around what data can be shared with AI tools and how it is handled, both in policy and by utilizing your security technology to give you full visibility. Data protection is the backbone of safe AI adoption.</p>

<p>Enabling clear boundaries now will prevent potential loss later. Rule #4: Access Controls and Guardrails
Letting employees use AI without controls is like handing your car keys to a teenager and yelling, ‚ÄúDrive safe!‚Äù without driving lessons. You need technology that enables access controls to determine which tools are being used and under what conditions. This is new for everyone, and your organization is relying on you to make the rules.</p>

<p>The golden rule: zero trust. Still! Make sure your security tools enable you to define clear, customizable policies for AI use, like:
Blocking AI vendors that don‚Äôt meet your security standards
Restricting connections to certain types of AI apps
Trigger a workflow to validate the need for a new AI tool
Rule #5: Continuous Oversight
Securing your AI is not a ‚Äúset it and forget it‚Äù project. Applications evolve, permissions change, and employees find new ways to use the tools.</p>

<p>Without ongoing oversight, what was safe yesterday can quietly become a risk today. The golden rule: keep watching. Continuous oversight means:
Monitoring apps for new permissions, data flows, or behaviors
Auditing AI outputs to ensure accuracy, fairness, and compliance
Reviewing vendor updates that may change how AI features work
Being ready to step in when AI is breached
This is not about micromanaging innovation. It is about making sure AI continues to serve your business safely as it evolves.</p>

<p>Harness AI wisely
AI is here, it is useful, and it is not going anywhere. The smart play for CISOs and security leaders is to adopt AI with intention. These five golden rules give you a blueprint for balancing innovation and protection. They will not stop your employees from experimenting, but they will stop that experimentation from turning into your next security headline.</p>

<p>A widespread data theft campaign has allowed hackers to breach sales automation platform
Salesloft
to steal OAuth and refresh tokens associated with the Drift artificial intelligence (AI) chat agent. The activity, assessed to be opportunistic in nature, has been attributed to a threat actor tracked by Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) and Mandiant, tracked as UNC6395. GTIG told The Hacker News that it‚Äôs aware of over 700 potentially impacted organizations. ‚ÄúBeginning as early as August 8, 2025, through at least August 18, 2025, the actor targeted Salesforce customer instances through compromised OAuth tokens associated with the Salesloft Drift third-party application,‚Äù researchers Austin Larsen, Matt Lin, Tyler McLellan, and Omar ElAhdan
said
.</p>

<p>In these attacks, the threat actors have been observed exporting large volumes of data from numerous corporate Salesforce instances, with the likely aim of harvesting credentials that could be then used to compromise victim environments. These include Amazon Web Services (AWS) access keys (AKIA), passwords, and
Snowflake
-related access tokens. UNC6395 has also demonstrated operational security awareness by deleting query jobs, although Google is urging organizations to review relevant logs for evidence of data exposure, alongside revoking API keys, rotating credentials, and performing further investigation to determine the extent of compromise. Salesloft, in an advisory issued August 20, 2025, said it identified a security issue in the Drift application and that it has proactively revoked connections between Drift and Salesforce.</p>

<p>The incident does not affect customers who do not integrate with Salesforce. ‚ÄúA threat actor used OAuth credentials to exfiltrate data from our customers‚Äô Salesforce instances,‚Äù Salesloft
said
. ‚ÄúThe threat actor executed queries to retrieve information associated with various Salesforce objects, including Cases, Accounts, Users, and Opportunities.‚Äù
The company is also recommending that administrators re-authenticate their Salesforce connection to re-enable the integration. The exact scale of the activity is not known.</p>

<p>However, Salesloft said it has notified all affected parties. In a statement Tuesday, Salesforce said a ‚Äúsmall number of customers‚Äù were impacted, stating the issue stems from a ‚Äúcompromise of the app‚Äôs connection.‚Äù
‚ÄúUpon detecting the activity, Salesloft, in collaboration with Salesforce, invalidated active Access and Refresh Tokens, and removed Drift from AppExchange. We then notified affected customers,‚Äù Salesforce
added
. The development comes as
Salesforce instances
have
become an active target
for financially motivated threat groups like
UNC6040 and UNC6240
(aka ShinyHunters), the latter of which has since joined hands with Scattered Spider (aka UNC3944) to secure initial access.</p>

<p>Austin Larsen, principal threat analyst at GTIG, said UNC6395 is a new emerging cluster, adding ‚Äúwe have not observed any compelling evidence connecting them to other groups at this time.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs most noteworthy about the UNC6395 attacks is both the scale and the discipline,‚Äù Cory Michal, CSO of AppOmni, said. ‚ÄúThis wasn‚Äôt a one-off compromise; hundreds of Salesforce tenants of specific organizations of interest were targeted using stolen OAuth tokens, and the attacker methodically queried and exported data across many environments.‚Äù
‚ÄúThey demonstrated a high level of operational discipline, running structured queries, searching specifically for credentials, and even attempting to cover their tracks by deleting jobs. The combination of scale, focus, and tradecraft makes this campaign stand out.‚Äù
Michal also pointed out that many of the targeted and compromised organizations were themselves security and technology companies, indicating that the campaign may be an ‚Äúopening move‚Äù as part of a broader supply chain attack strategy. ‚ÄúBy first infiltrating vendors and service providers, the attackers put themselves in position to pivot into downstream customers and partners,‚Äù Michal added.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat makes this not just an isolated SaaS compromise, but potentially the foundation for a much larger campaign aimed at exploiting the trust relationships that exist across the technology supply chain.‚Äù
Update
Saleloft, in a follow-up alert, said it has engaged the services of Mandiant and Coalition to investigate the breach and to facilitate containment and remediation efforts. It‚Äôs also urging Drift customers to update their API keys for each connected Drift integration. ‚ÄúWe are recommending that all Drift customers who manage their own Drift connections to third-party applications via API key, proactively revoke the existing key and reconnect using a new API key for these applications,‚Äù it
said
. ‚ÄúThis only relates to API key-based Drift integrations.</p>

<p>OAuth applications are being handled directly by Salesloft.‚Äù
(The story was updated after publication to include a response from GTIG/Mandiant and Salesloft‚Äôs latest advisory.)
